F you are a wife working outside the
home, you may think that your hus¬
— band, who has consented to your
working and resigned to a home run by
outside help, has been won over to your
way of thinking. But has he been won
over? He is resigned, perhaps, but do
you know what he feels deep down in his
heart? You will know if you turn to
page 12... This may explain why some¬
times, hubby sulks, apparently, for no
reason.
OMETHING over which you will be
S vehement about one way or another
is the symposium (pages 10 and 11) on
the cost of medical service in the Philip¬
pines. There are claims that the cost is
burdensome and far beyond the means of
the tao, no less than the president of the
Philippine Islands Medical Association
claiming it to be so. But others claim the
cost of medical service is decidedly not
burdensome. On which side are you?
AST week, you will remember,
L young people in society were placed
on the carpet, so to say, and taken to task
for their merrymaking, for setting a bad
example by their extravagance, etc.
Wouldn’t you want to hear what young
socialites" say on the matter? You
would.... page 9, please.
ND now, let us say you have a new
A house. You have had it built ac-
cording to your specifications. You have
been living in it a few months. Well,
how do you like your house? Has it
turned out exactly the way you planned
it: serving all the purposes for which
every portion of the house has been in¬
tended?
That is just exactly what we want to
know about the Constitution, in opera¬
tion since the President, decorated, shin-
ing with aggressiveness, took his oath of
office last November 15th. How is it func¬
tioning? There has been a lot of talk
about some of the President’s acts dent¬
ing the Constitution. The wisdom of
the provisions of the fundamental law
has been questioned. You will find the
article, The Constitution At Work, page
6, illuminating and timely in view of the
fact that the first anniversary of the
Constitution is due this week, on Febru¬
ary 8th.
YERNANDO OCAMPO author of
 The Assassins, this week’s local
fiction, reveals unusual talent in charac¬
ter study. Better get acquainted with Ju¬
lio and also with the assassins. Most of
us experience Julio’s emotions only in
terrible nightmares.
O. Henry we have often heard the
literati say, is famous for the surprise
endings of his tales. If this is true, then
A Service of Love, this week’s foreign
fiction, does enough justice to O. Henry’s
literary fame. The sentimental will be
fishing for their handkerchief after read¬
ing the story, blow their nose..... and
sigh. it is so nice!
And don’t fail to read Genius In In¬
sane Asylums (page 22) and You Are
Never Too Old (page 23). The first is
very interesting, the second, very com¬
forting.

Is It Going To Last?


NHORTLY after President Quezon assumed office he announ¬
S ced this policy:
“More government and less politics."
If the President thought he would startle the nation with this
pelicy, he was mistaken. The general opinion was that the President
was indulging in one of his favorite pastimes: the making of slogans.
Considering the record of the government before the inauguration of
the Commonwealth, a record which shows that in the majority of
instances everything was subservient to politics, it was natural that
the public was unimpressed with the President’s declaration of
divorce from politics.
But now the public is beginning to wonder if after all the
resident meant every word in his "more government and less po¬
ics" statement. The President has been acting like politics does
mean a thing to him, like he is not concerned whether or not


he pleases his political friends. More and more, apparently at
least, he is taking his own counsel and paying less and less at¬
tention to politics-inspired suggestions from those around him. He
has made up his mind, it seems, to clean up house in the govern¬
ment and is proceeding with the work his own way.
Where the supreme court would have allowed Judge Paredes to
resign, the President elected to dismiss him. His handling of the
bandit situation in Laguna and Tayabas is unique. The dispatch
with which he acts is something new in the government: the inves¬
tigation of the director of the bureau of commerce and the probe into
oil leases are examples. He has ordered a hard drive against jueteng:
warning officials of the certainty of penalty for failure to suppress
this vice. It is said that civil service rules, for the first time, are
beginning to mean something: the President adhering strictly to them.
Nice work, all this.
But is it going to last?

Concepcion Meadis
Court Of
Appeals


EROM the time the National
Assembly approved the ad¬
A ministration-drafted, a d mi¬
nistration-sponsored bill creating
the court of appeals, local news¬
papers, assisted by wagging ton¬
gues and lawyers, have been en¬
gaged in a queer guessing game.
Who will take up the delicate task
of organizing this newest unit of
the Philippine judiciary and who
will be the judges to sit in this new
court?
Names have been shuffled and
re-shuffled. A prominent member
of the National Assembly, Floor
Leader Francisco Enage, resigned
from that body and made public a
letter of President Quezon offer¬
ing him the presidency of the new
court. For a time, it appeared that
Judge Enage was sure of the post
But a storm of protest over the un¬
constitutionality of his appoint¬
ment ensued, followed by a decla¬
ration of Benigno Aquino, chair¬
man of the commission on appoint-
ments, that he would fight the ap-
pointment “even if it costs me my
job. Newspaper writers and
legal minds, outstanding among
them being Judge Guillermo Gue¬
vara, advanced the attack and the


honor of being the first to be¬
come chairman of the newly
created court of appeals.
In shuffling the names of jur¬
ists cligible to the distinguished
position it is interesting to note
that the name of the retired judge
was left unmentioned by the pa¬
pers. The appoinment, although
praised in legal circles, was a
surprise to many.
Judge Concepcion is known as
one of the country’s ablest jurists
and boasts of an exemplary record
as a court of first instance
judge. He believes that judges
should keep themselves aloof from
others and that they should have
no social contact with the public.
Before his retirement from the
judiciary, Judge Concepcion was


Up to press time, the other
judges to compose the court of ay-
peals were still unamed. Hov.
ever, sources close to the office of
the President ventured to an¬
nounce this week that the follov
ing five candidates have alreac
been chosen:

frequently mentioned as a prob¬
ab e appointee to the supreme
court. When the membership of
the supreme court was increased,
he was a very strong candidate
for the high tribunal. But some-
how, he was never appointed.


Judge Concepcion came from
poor Manila family. His fathe
died when he was still a student
and he had to support his mother
and go to school at the same time.
He is a graduate of the Universit.
of Santo Tomas college of law and
had practised law together with
such well-known lawyers as the
late Francisco Ortigas, Jose Juan
faza, and Baldomero Hazanas. He
had served the government in va

list. The guessing game partly

the announcement of the appoint-

the presidency of the court of ap-

the announcement of other ap¬

A COURT PURGE
SHOULD RESTORE FAITH OF PEOPLE
IN COURTS OF JUSTICE


Within our penitentiaries are men whe
feel that they have not been given the
justice they deserve.


ruvHE publication of some of the
charges against Judge Gero¬
I nimo Paredes of the court of
first instance of Iloilo and the
terse order of dismissal of the
said judge by the President fo¬
cussed attention on the very la¬
mentable lack of confidence of
the people in their courts of jus¬
tice.
For the people, especially in the
provinces, fear the courts. They
are not afraid of the law; but
they fear the judge who renders
the courts hateful to them. For
these people, the temples of jus¬
tice, evinced by previous sad ex¬
periences, are neither strongholds
of their rights nor sanctuaries
for the redress of their wrongs.
To them the courts are places
where poor, ignorant litigants and
witnesses are humiliated, where
they are harassed and annoyed;
where, undeserved, they find im-
prisonment. They believe the
courts have justice only for the
rich and the politician; and injus¬
tice, even to the person wronged, if
he is not influential.
That much, it must be admitted,
is the brazen fact. And there can
be no question, too, a number of
men—at present ensconced in the
apparent security of judicial posi¬
tions—have given causes for dis¬
couragement, if not apathy, in ap¬
proaching the courts.
The case of Judge Geronimo
Paredes of the court of first in¬
stance of Iloilo, who was summar¬
ily dismissed by President Quezon
last week, well illustrates the
process by which the people have
lost their confidence in the courts


of justice. The judge was found
guilty by the supreme court of
three of several administrative
charges filed against him by As¬
semblyman Ruperto Montinola.
The first charge relates to the
trial and conviction of one Cesareo
Durban, heard in 1923. Judge Pa¬
redes had been inexcusably indis¬
creet, so the supreme court found
out, in his conduct, by telling
Francisco Gotera, his father-in-law,
that Durban would probably be con¬
victed. This indiscretion gave his
father-in-law, who was in financial
difficulties, opportunity in using
the information to borrow P800 from
Ubaldo Robles, a person interested
in Durban’s conviction.
On another charge, that his wife,
Mrs. Maria de Paredes, tried to ob¬
tain P500 from the defendants—in
the case of P. A. Uy Yam Sons &
Co. vs. Ricardo A. Luna, et al, the
supreme court said that Judge Pa¬
redes’ position in the home permit¬
ted him to know of the negotiations
made by his wife, which he should
have prevented. Even if such was
not the truth, nevertheless, said the
supreme court, because of family
circumstances, Judge Paredes is in
a situation in which he cannot pre¬
serve and protect the confidence
which he is entitled to inspire in
his official acts.
Of the highly-humiliating way
Judge Paredes presided over cases,
the following stenographic notes
were mentioned in the decision of
the supreme court:


They fear the courts, have no con¬
fidence in them.


Q—But did you not
go up Demetria’s
house so that she may
remove the mote from
your eyes?
A—Had not that in¬
cident taken place, I
certainly would have
gone up.
COURT—The Court
sentences you to ar¬
resto for 10 days for
your failure to give a
categorical reply to the
question. One more
question, Mr. Lopez¬
vito.


whom they dislike?
A.—It was not my purpose to ei¬
ther sell or prostitute my daugh-
ter, Judge, (witness weeps), my
purpose was only to have Soledad
get married at 24.
COURT—Answer my question,
otherwise I will have to put you in
jail....
COURT—Yoff are a woman with-
out a conscience; the court can’t be¬
lieve you; you are a wicked woman;
get out of here. Let another wit¬
ness take the stand.
It should be said that not all
judges are guilty of discouraging
confidence in our courts. But there
have been instances where the ar¬
rogance of a judge far exceeded
the height of his rostrum; where
his indecorous attitude to humi¬
liate those in the court room
plucked away the fight in a liti¬
gant, or frightened a witness into
holding himself from revealing the
truth. There have been times
where a judge made law and jus¬
tice subservient to friendship,
where the name of a famous
counsel made the judge pen a de¬
cision favoring the lawyer’s client.
There was the case of a judge
who fawned to and ingratiated him¬
self to senators of the defunct Phil¬
ippine legislature. He wrote his
decisions always remembering, fa¬
(Continued on page 55)


COURT—But from
the way this witness
has been answering the
question asked him, you
see clearly, Mr. Fiscal,
that he is lying.
A—I am not lying,
Mr. Judge; were I con¬
vinced that I was lying
here, you may even kill
me.
COURT—And if the
court could do it, Mr.
Witness, it would do so E
gladly.
A—It is because I am convinced
I am telling the truth.
COURT—Keep silent: the order
of arresto for 10 days against you,
Mr. Witness, is reiterated, for con¬
tempt of court, discourtesy and....
well, is there anything else, Mr.
Fiscal? If that is the way this
witness testifies before the court,
he cannot be given credence by any
means. Go on, Mr. Fiscal.


In another case, a petition for
annulment of marriage filed by one
Soledad Espino, she and her moth-
er testified in part as follows:
COURT—Why are you interested
in having your daughter, S. Espino,
marry Jose Arquero?
A.—Because I liked J. Arquero.
COURT—For how much did you
sell your daughter, S. Espino, to J.
Arquero?
A.—(Witness weeps) Your Hon¬
or, I never sold my daughter to J.
Arquero.
COURT—Why not? You de¬
ceived her so she would sell not on¬
ly her body but her soul as well, to
a man, didn’t you?
A.—(Witness still weeps.)
COURT—What sort of a moth-
er’s heart have you? What is your
religion?
A.—Roman Catholic.
COURT—Is that the teaching
given to you by your religion? To
sell your daughters? To prostitute
them by turning them over to men

Coaxing Wins Where Bayonets Fail
Tayabas Bandit Hunt Ends —Constabulary Ordered Withdrawn


and released him on his promise
to bring from the mountains the
remaining outlaws, the bandit
hunt ended, with all the hunted
men who have succeeded in esca¬
ping constabulary bullets behind
jail bars.
Following the surrender and re¬
lease of “Capitan” Encallado, the
surrender of the members of the
bandit leader’s band came in rapid
succession. While “Capitan Kulas”
after his release appeared not over
anxious to comply with his promise
to round up the rest of his follow-
ers, he had been charged with in-
difference and spending his time
contacting radical leaders in his lo¬
cality instead of complying with
his promise to locate the members
of his gang, his daughter, Aurelia


Encallado who, by the way, engi¬
neered the surrender of Kulas En¬
callado, continued contacting the
harassed bandits still in the field.
Whether her contacts with the ban¬
dits were under the direction of her
father or on her own initiative can¬
not be ascertained, but it is a fact
that she has had a hand in most of
the subsequent surrenders.
In the morning of January 22nd,
Encallado followers, one a nephew,
approached the constabulary au¬
thorities stationed in Cavinti, La¬
guna, and gave themselves up and
trust in the justice of the courts
rather than in the swift justice
that constabulary bullets mete out.
Those who surrendered were Filo¬
meno Encallado, nephew of “Capi¬
tan Kulas” (Filomeno later on com¬

criticized for giving the so-called

treatment.
But while the President’s me-
thod in hunting bandits appears
thoroughly unorthodox, later dev¬
elopments have shown that it is
quite effective. Bandit Leader
Encallado, hungry, feeble, in tat-
ters surrendered to Governor Rod¬

last roaming bandit, his own son
Engracio Encallado, surrendered
to the authorities on January 29th.

CONSTITUTION
G WORK


This Saturday, February 8th, is
the first anniversary of the Consti¬
tution. The Constitution, however,
has been in force only since the
inauguration of the Commonwealth
of the Philippines on Nov. 15, 1935,
or hardly three months ago. How
has the Constitution worked with-
in the short period of time that it
has been in force? Have there
been differences of opinion regard¬
ing certain provisions of the Con¬
stitution?
How the Constitution has work¬
ed so far, in the opinion of a law¬
yer whose identity cannot be re¬


vealed due to the position he occu¬
pies, is shown in the following
article:
y HATEVER may be the

 fate of the Constitution
which we have just for¬
mulated—and our optimism makes
us hope that it will emerge victo¬
rious from the ordeals of time
and circumstance—when we re¬
turn to the privacy of our homes
and take up again the thread of
our daily tasks, we shall have the
intimate satisfaction and the hon-
est conviction of having, in the


brief scope of this
Constitution laid for
our people and the gov-
ernment the basis of a
free, peaceful and or¬
derly life, a life of pro¬
gress and happiness!”


Has the Constitution, as Convention President
al convention. The dele- Recto said in his valed ctory, emerged “pictorious from
the ordeals of time and circumstance”? Above photo
shaws those on the restrum during the last session of
the constitutional convention.


It will be exactly a
year ago, this coming
Saturday, when t h e
Hon. Claro M. Recto,
as its august president,
uttered this climax of
his valedictory at the
closing session of the
Philippine constitution-
gates to the convention,
the members of the
Philippine legislature,
the audience rose to
their feet and gave the Hon. Rec¬
to an ovation never heard before in¬
side the legislative building.
That stirring occasion happened
a year ago, two days from to-day.
And the fundamental law of the
land has been in full force and ef¬
fect since November 15, 1935.
But, it is well to ask, has the
Constitution emerged “victorious
from the ordeals of time and cir¬
cumstance”? Are the attributes of
strength and the qualities of per¬
manence, of which the fundamental
charter is endowed, impregnable—
as they should be—against renova¬
tion and attacks in the form of in¬
terpretations?
Thinking along that line we
come, if we observe more closely, to
some trespasses—we will not say
violations—on several provisions of
the Constitution.
Violation No. 12
For example, Article 6, Section 9,
paragraph 2 of the Constitution
provides:
“No provision or enactment shall
be embraced in the general ap¬
propriations, unless it relates spe¬


cifically to some particular appro¬
priation in the bill; and any such
provision or enactment shall be
limited in its operation to such
appropriation."
But this constitutional provision
has been violated—shall we say fla¬
grantly ?—by the defunct Philippine
legislature when it passed Act. No.
4231, the General Appropriations
Act for 1936, last August 16, 1935,
said act taking effect on January
1, 1936.
The oversight, to put it mildly,
was in the form of a “rider,” for
the benefit of the department of
labor, and inconspicuously hidden
among the general provisions of
Act. No. 4231. The rider runs:
“Section 30.—Any officer, em¬
ployee or laborer who may be se¬
parated or retired from the service
as a result of any reorganization
that may be effected in the De¬
partment of Labor or in the
bureau or office under it during
the years 1934 and 1935 may be
granted gratuity in accordance
with the provision of Act Num¬
bered Forty Hundred and fifty-one
which is revived in so far as said
officer, employee or laborer is con¬
cerned: Provided, However that
the positions of officers, employees
or laborers so retired shall not be
filled except those which may be
filled under Act Numbered Forty
Hundred and fifty-one.”
Delving into history, the Consti¬
tution was ratified by the Filipino
people on May 14, 1935; certified
by the Philippine legislature on
June 12, 1935; and, two days later,
the governor-general called for a
presidential election.

Some delegates to the constitutional
convention.. The Constitution they helpec
formulate, according to not a few ob¬
servers, has not been closely followed.


Now act No. 4231, or the Gen¬
eral Appropriations Act for 1936,
was passed by the legislature on
August 16, 1935, to take effect on
January 1, 1936. At the time they
passed the law, the legislators had
already full cognizance of the pro¬
visions of the Constitution, yet why
did they deliberately violate para¬
graph 2, Section 9, of Article 6 pro¬
hibiting the insertion of riders?

Violation No. 2?
Only recently, a sacred provision
embodied in the bill of rights of
our Constitution was, perhaps, un¬
intentionally disregarded.
Section 1, paragraph 9, of the
bill of rights says:
"No law granting a title of
nobility shall be enacted, and no
person holding any office of profit
or trust shall, without the consent


of the National Assembly, accept
any present, emolument, office, or
title of any kind whatever from
any foreign state."
Mayor Juan Posadas, as mayor,
is holding an office of trust. He
is not supposed to accept, during
his incumbency and except when
consented to by the National As¬
sembly, any present, emolument,
office, or title of any kind from


any foreign country.
But he was conferred, and did
accept, the latter part of December,
1935—when the Constitution was
already in force—a title from the
Spanish Republic.
Violation No. 3?
Looking the Constitution over,
we find another provision not yet
being strictly followed. Section 1


of Article 11, referring to the civil
service, says:
“Section 1.—A Civil Service em¬
bracing all branches and subdivi¬
sions of the Government shall be
provided by law. Appointments in
the Civil Service, except as to those
which are policy-determining, pri¬
marily confidential or highly tech-
nical in nature, shall be made only

Cashing In On
Young Lawvers
Exploitation Of New
Bar Members Exposed
By AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY


PrHEY have sworn never to do
wrong, nor to let others
Iwrong them; not to exploit
another nor allow themselves to
be exploited. They know the law,
and many a time they have saved
a man’s property and even his life;
but, ironically enough, they per¬
mit themselves to be exploited by
colleagues in the profession. It is
not infrequent, therefore, that a
great many find themselves exact-
ly where they have started.
That, in common, is the bitter


experience of new lawyers. Find¬
ing themselves, perhaps by mistake,
successful bar candidates, they
give up their government positions
or jobs with private commercial
firms, and manage to become as
sistant attorneys in Manila’s num¬
erous law firms. From here starts
their tale of woe and heartbreak.
To begin with, the name of as¬
sistant attorney or office lawyer,
does not mean much. Simply, he is
a researcher, or a new attorney in
a law firm learning the practical
side of the legal profession as ap¬

New lawyers being sworn in. They know the law and yet they get exploited by
their colleagues in the profession.


plied in the courtroom. And there
being an oversupply of lawyers
now, a law firm does not give the
new fellow all the conveniences he
is entitled to.
For example, with few excep¬
tions the new lawyer must furnish
his own desk, chair, typewriter and,
at times, stationery. Also the books
most essential to his profession:
Civil Code, Revised Penal Code,
Code of Commerce, Land Registra¬
tion and Mortgages, Code of Civil
Procedure, and a book on legal
forms. He should have them for
the firm has only legal reference
books. Without a typewriter, he
has to wait for his turn on the
firm’s rickety, worn-out machine
thus forcing him first to make his
legal notes in long-hand.
Almost always, an assistant at¬
torney gets no salary at all. Here
in Manila, only two or three law
firms—and they are all American
ones—offer these new lawyers sal¬
aries, from P50.00 a month and up
With Filipino law firms, an assist¬
ant attorney is simply promised a
commission the rate of which is not
fixed, for any case of the firm
which he handles and wins. Any
lawsuit, however, that is brought
to him by strangers is his own, and
he is entitled to pocket all the fees.
But rarely does he get a case of his
Own.
Several city law firms, for sheer
stinginess, make the assistant at-
torney give—to the firm—one-half
of his earnings from cases private¬
ly brought to him by his own cli¬
ents. Even the fees for notarial
inscriptions frequently go to the
firm’s coffers. And, likewise, as¬
sistant attorneys make notarial do¬
cuments—for the firm—which
should be a good source of income
for a struggling abogado—without
receiving the corresponding pay¬
ments.
Assistant attorneys, the newest
ones, are made to handle losing ca¬
ses. As one of the young lawyers
in a Manila law office said:
“The office gives me only sure
losing cases. The absolutely win¬
ning ones, the partners keep for
themselves. I go to the city courts,
and even to the municipal courts of
the suburbs, at my own expense.
The firm does not give me any
transportation allowance. I am
more than lucky if the client comes


with a car or a calesa.
“One time I was sent to Tayabas
to handle a land case worth P5,000.
The office gave me only P5.00 for
transportation expenses. But the
case took the judge three days to
hear. With just P5.00 for railway,
hotel, and meal expenses, what did
you think I did? Why, I hunted
for a former law college classmate
who has turned business man, and
borrowed enough money. The case?
I won it, but the fees went to the
law firm. I have not been reim¬
bursed yet.
Another struggling lawyer, after
a year as assistant attorney, earned
his first fee. And what a fee!
“The boss told me to go to Para¬
naque one morning for a desahu¬
cio case. Well, he didn’t give me
any transportation money; he sim¬
ply said the client might give me
something. I went there, handled
the case, and got an acquittal for
my client. Next, I asked my client
for my fees. He gave me P0.50, but
my bus expenses totaled P0.45. So
that netted me, for my first case,
exactly five centavos!
The Paranaque counsel for the
losing party, a friend of his, he ad¬
ded, received a much better fee:
P5.00, plus a pair of ducks and two
dozen eggs.
The young lawyer in the firm
is heavily utilized in the making of
briefs, court appeals, bills of ex¬
ceptions. But he does not get any
credit for them. The boss always
signs his name to the document.
Thus, minus any form of compen¬
sation, he is deprived of even his
own work. Which, in a big way,
adds insult to injury, said a dis¬
gruntled Ll.B.
The assistant attorney always
starts as researcher for the law
ffirm. He stays in the office until
night, hunting for the proper cita¬
tions that will fit their side of a
case. He becomes a bookworm, he
rarely appears in court, and finally
loses all desire to become a trial
lawyer because of the discouraging
difficulties of court proceedings.
There’s the case of a woman law¬
yer, she was once a bar topnotcher,
who was assigned to handle a law¬
suit in the province. She appeared
in court, but the judge ridiculed her
manner of handling the case. Dis¬
appointed and discouraged, she re¬

Say Young People
Young “Socialites”

In Society—
State Their


AST week we published the
article: “Our Young 'So¬
M cialites,”” which charged
young people in society with in¬
dulging in what appears to be un¬
necessary pleasures and neglecting
their opportunity to lead in the
task of helping the less fortunate.
Now we have the other side of the
question, the side of the young
people themselves.


Miss Lourdes Alunan: is of the
opinion that society people lead in
campaigns for the improvement of the
masses.


“They have society people all
wrong!”
In such terse words, pretty Miss
Rosario Diokno, popular city "so¬
cialite" and member of Smiles and
Rho Alpha, makes her retort to the
charges that young society people
go in for too much dancing and
spending orgies without thinking
of the masses.
“I simply can’t understand it,”
said Miss Diokno, a serious look
creeping into her beautiful eyes.

“Their charges fairly brand us
with selfishness, with self-centered
exclusiveness that incorrectly make
us a set of people who refuse to
mingle with the crowd. Just be¬
cause some names appear too fre¬
quently in the society pages others
think we are pleasure-mad, scat¬
ter-brained, and without sense of
proportion. But, I ask you, is that
true?
“What are those dances and
balls, anyway,” the Santo Tomas
university beauty continued. “We
don’t hold them every Saturday.
Parties, well, maybe. But who'd
refuse going to her friend’s birth¬
day party or linen shower? That
would be just telling your friend:
Go, invite another one. I don’t
like you."
“Manila dances, naturally, are
expensive. But we have them, just
the same, to be nospitable; not sim-
ply to enjoy. And, besides, one so¬
ciety gives only one or two dances
a year. But, because there are sev-
eral societies which, naturally, have
to hold their respective dances,
others believe the young people in
society keep on a round of social
pleasures.
"And yet, after a big affair has
been planned and carried out, do
you think society girls will lay
awake nights thinking of the next
excuse for another ball? Decided¬
ly not! We stay home and assist
in the housework. The telephone
may ring, but we don’t keep an ear
to the telephone all the while.
“And speaking of social welfare
work," added Miss Diokno, "why,
we do help a lot, too. Just go over
the list of the members of some of
the city’s leagues and federations
for the promotion of the poor’s wel¬
fare, for civic improvement, and
you will come across the names of
people who belong, and move, in
society."
A concrete example, she said, was
the performance at the Manila
Opera House last December 28th,
held in connection with the Ermita
fiesta the next day.
“It was a benefit performance
and the proceeds went to the Er¬
mita church,” she explained. "Young
people took part in the program,
gave their time and services free—
all for the sake of charity! Aside
from that, do you know how much
society people contribute for char¬
ity? Every time there is a Red
Cross, tuberculosis, typhoon, or
some other charity campaign, we
give freely."
Miss Lourdes Alunan, well-known
in Manila society, is also of the


Miss Rosario Diokno: says young
people in high society do a lot of social
welfare work.


opinion that the charges against
young people in society are based
on wrong premises.
Society people, she knew, always
lead in the campaigns for the ma¬
terial improvement of the masses.
Take the past Red Cross drives
alone. Every year one of the Ma¬
nila societies, Smiles, Bachelors"
Club, Rho Alpha, Kahirup, Nucleo
Solteril, was assigned a night each
during the drive. The young peo¬
ple enthusiastically entered into
the spirit of the thing, and held
tea dansants at the canteens.
Everything—food, refreshments,
music, entertainment—was given
free. The society ladies themselves
had the charge of the canteens.
And it could be mentioned well that
those society nights netted profit¬

It Is Too Expensive To The Masses
By DR. RUFINO ABRIOL
President, Philippine Istands Medical Association


w S medicine too expensive in
the Philippines, especially for
A
the common tao?
If we consider the rates charged
by local physicians and take into
account the income of our wage¬
earners, my answer is yes. Med¬
icine, it has to be admitted, is too
expensive for some of our people
and thus constitutes a great finan¬
cial burden to our poor families.
Let us glance at rates charged
and judge the matter from an en¬
tirely impersonal viewpoint. Or¬
dinary consultation or treatment, if
done in the clinic of a physician,
costs the patient on the average
P2.00. If a doctor is called to the
house of the patient, the latter is
usually charged P3.00. A great
majority of our wage-earners, both
in Manila and in the provinces, earn
only from P.50 to P.80 a day. If a
Manila laborer becomes sick, as he
does get sick once in a while, he
pays his doctor P3.00 a visit. Have
some of us realized or figured out

that it will take the laborer earn¬
ing P.50 a day six full working
days in order to pay his doctor?
Have some of us realized that if
the same patient were confined to
bed one full week, it would take
him forty-two working days to pay
his doctor with his earnings and
leave absolutely nothing for his
family’s necessities and for his
drug store bills?
Few of us have considered this
pathetic situation. In the United
States, where an ordinary chauffeur
earns from $2 to $4 a day, a house
call costs the patients only $2 or a
little more. Comparing the scale
of wages here and in America, and
comparing the rates charged by
doctors and those in the States, we
cannot but conclude that medicine
is really too expensive in the Phil-
ippines.
We must not forget, however,
that the medical we’fare of the
common tao is not neglected by the
government. We have, thanks to
the government, a number of free
clinics where our poor patients are
given free treatments. These clin-
ics are, however, limited to Manila
and big towns so that the benefits
extended by these institutions are
limited to a few places. In some of
our rural communities our indigent
people still have to avail thewselves
of the services of private doctors
who can dictate their own rates. In
such places as these, medicine is in


deed too expensive.


Primo Datu, one of the biggest
individual agents of the Philippine
Charity Sweepstakes, said: “I sel¬
dom get sick myself but I know of
many friends who become flat
broke' or who go into debt follow¬
ing a brief period of medical treat¬
ment. From this, it is to be de¬
duced that medical attention is very
expensive."
Said J. Katigbak, a certified pub¬
lic accountant: “Surely, medicine is
very expensive here. My child once
had an eye disease and we had to
bring him to an eye specialist. The
specialist examined the eyes of my
child, placed a drap of liquid in the
eye affected, asked for P3.00 and
told us to come again the next day.
The following day, he applied the
same medicine, asked for another
P3.00 and instructed me to bring
the child without fail the follow¬
ing afternoon. At the end of the
sixth day, we found ourselves
poorer by P18. We also bought cer¬
tain drugs for the child which cost
us P42.00. The treatment lasted a
month and if I remember right, we
paid the doctor in fees alone some¬
thing like P80. If I were a clerk
earning only P35.00 a month, or a
common laborer receiving only P1.00
a day, you will know if I could af¬
ford the treatment or not."
Santiago Goduco, driver, Malate


Opinions differ on whether medical
service in the Islands is expensive or
not. Dr. Abriol believes that it is cost¬
ly, especially to the common tao.


Ask the head of any mid-
dle-class family what he fears
most and he will tell you that
next to unemployment and
sudden death, it is sickness.
It keeps him away from
work, he will tell you, and
then he will add, rather bit¬
terly, that medical service
once ate up all his savings,
and even put him in debt.
The family man is not
alone in protesting against
the high price of getting sick
in the Philippines. Every¬


Taxicab: “Yes, it is very expensive.
I am a man of but very little means,
and whenever I get sick, or when¬
ever any member of my family
does, I am always forced to bor¬
row money. In the signboards of
many doctors here, we read this
notice: Walang Bayad Ang Con¬
sulta Para sa Mahirap (No con¬
sultation fee for the poor.) But
when we approach many of these
doctors, they ask many questions.
They even think that you are lying
when you say that you are poor and
cannot pay the consultation fee.
Urgent calls for doctors to our home
always cost us P4.00 a call. Heaven
knows how much that amount
means to me and to my family."

a nephew of the President.
The President declared that
the drastic punishment was nec-
essary to emphasize the govern¬
ment’s determination to stamp
out the contemptible practice of
maltreating subordinates in the
military school; that while disci¬
plinary methods are allowed in
the academy to teach subordin¬
ation, the production of servile
men is not permitted.

ISLANDS TOO EXPENSIVEP


where we see sick men, wo¬
men, and children who, al¬
though seriously needing me¬
dical attention, cannot avail
themselves of the services of
a physician for the simple
reason that it is not within
their means to do so.
On the other hand, there
are those who claim that me¬
dical service here is not ex¬
pensive. Now, is medicine, or
medical service, really too
expensive in the Philippines?
This is what this symposium
seeks to answer.


w have been engaged in this pro¬
fession in the Philippines since
1906, and have been in pri¬
vate practice in Manila since 1918.
I know whereof I speak when I
argue that medicine is not very
expensive for the tao in the Phil¬
ippines.
Medical practice has been a great
and noble adventure with me. As
I look back at the thirty years which
I have spent in the Philippines dis¬
pensing my humble services to all
classes of people, I cannot but feel
that as an adventure it has been
worth-while.
Why do I believe that this ad-
venture has been worth-while? Is
it because of the money that has
come my way?
No. I consider the services I
have rendered and the satisfaction
that I have derived out of helping
relieve the sufferings of others

tion charges and .thes mdizal tees are

more valuable than anything in the
world. And I believe that I am
not alone in my love of the prof¬
ession.
When one considers therefore
that it is not to make money but
to serve suffering humanity that
makes the medical profession truly
enjoyable, then one cannot say that
doctors heartlessly burden the com-
mon tao with excessive fees.
From my knowledge of current
practices, local consultation charges,
and other medical fees are equit¬
able and just. The rich are charged
higher rates, but this is because
they can afford to pay more. On
the other hand, those who are too


poor to pay anything are made to
pay nothing. Why should it be
charged then that Philippine doc-
tors demand excessive rates for
their services?
We have hundreds of young doc¬
tors who practice without getting
the compensation due them. It is
not uncommon these days to hear
of medicos, full-fledged graduates
in first rate medical colleges, re¬
ceiving a couple of chickens or a
dozen eggs for treating their pa¬
tients. Out in the provinces, such
cases as these are not rare occur-
rences.
A dozen eggs, as we know, costs


The Tao


no more than P.36, P.40 at the most.
And yet, doctors accept that amount
as fee for their professional ser¬
vices. The whole amount, it must
be understood, sometimes covers the
whole period during the illness of
his patient. During that time, the
doctor visits his patient almost
daily at a sacrifice. Some doctors
use their own automobiles or pay
their own fares to the house of
their pat'ents. In some of our
rural towns, consultation and treat¬
ment rates range from practically
nothing to P.50, although in visit¬
ing their patients, doctors some¬

HUSBANDS DONT WANT
WIVES TO WORK


THEIRE


SURVEY SHOWS —HUSBANDS OF WORKING WIVES ARE RESIGNED
BUT NOT RECONCILED TO THEIR WIVES WORKING OUTSIDE
OF THE HOME
By SOLEDAD HOJILLA


ANY a man, no matter how
modern in his belief in the
M ganest possible liberty for
women, is still old fashioned when
it comes to marriage, in the sense
that, like his forefathers, he wants
a home with his wife in it. This
desire may be subconscious, it
may be unexpressed, but just the
same it is there.
True, the modern husband no
longer expects his wife to attend
to all the details of housework as
the wives of old did, but he still
believes that her presence in the
house makes for a more well¬
ordered and more charming estab¬
lishment, well-cared for children,
and delicious meals of dishes
that he likes hest.
“Somehow things are always dif-
ferent when my wife is at home, as
on Sundays. She does not even
arrange the furniture nor cook the
meals herself. Perhaps, it is just
her presence that makes a lot of
difference in it.” This from a hus¬
band who, without realizing it, ex-
pressed the sentiment of many other
husbands whose wives are working
like his.
In our interview with more than
a dozen husbands whose wives are
working outside of the home, we
gathered that if a husband had his
own way, he would rather have his
wife stay at home instead of work-
ing, especially when there are chil-
dren below school age. But it seems
that he cannot do anything about
1 In these modern days, a hus¬
band cannot simply say to his wife,
“I object!" and she obeys. No,
everything must be reasoned out,
and when it comes to the question

of whether the wife should work
or not, the wife usually wins.
It is interesting to know that a
husband, when asked if he has any
objections to his wife’s working,
can find many reasons to give, fore¬
most among which is the fact that
his wife was already working be¬
fore her marriage, so she naturally
continued working after marriage.
Then, too, he believes that a woman
who has been trained, or who had
spent years and money training
for a vocational job or profession
should not let marriage interfere
with it, particularly if she has
achieved some sort of success in it.
In not a few cases the reason is
the husband’s insufficient income.
However, and this is the interest-
ing part of it, the discontent with


the husband’s income does not come
from him but from his wife, espe¬
cially when the wife was finan¬
cially independent before her mar¬
riage. The majority of the hus¬
bands whom we interviewed in¬
timated that they are earning
enough to enable their respective
families to live comfortably. Every
self-respecting husband wants to be
the sole provider for the family, no
matter how small his income may
be, but he also likes to have his
wife and his children have the
things that they think they should
have to make them happy. So, if
his wife would rather go out and
work to earn money with which to
hire servants to do the housework,
a cook to prepare the meals, and a
maid to look after the children, he
allows her to work. He can see
that she is far happier doing
work for which she has been pre¬
pared and which she likes than
staying at home and doing the
housework which she considers
a drudgery.
Not a few husbands said that
even if they were rich they would
still allow their wives to work, for
it would be better for them to in¬
dulge in gainful activities than to
indulge in unsavory affairs and gos¬
sips and pastimes that might also
take them out of their homes and
make then neglect their respective
families, as many idle wives do.
Moreover, they say, even with chil-
dren, the average housewife cannot
find enough to do in the house to
occupy her. Then, too, the wife
who has no outside interests is nar¬
row-minded, becomes prematurely
old, mentally as well as physically,
too, they say.
However, an old husband who is
strongly in favor of the “back to
the home” movement for women,
says that a resourceful and indus¬
trious wife can always find many
things to do in the house if she
wants to. The trouble with women
nowadays, he says, is that they are
no longer interested in housework.
If a woman has a hobby, it is
enough to occupy her, he continues.
And when a husband says that he
wants his wife to stay at home, he
does not mean that she cannot go
out to visit friends once in a while.
Going out to work is not the only
way of making interesting contacts,
of developing a mind, is his opinion.
There is reading and meeting peo¬
ple socially. Merely talking with
her husband, if the husband is in¬

Suffrage im Culiom
Women May Vote But Only
Men Can Hold Public Office
By FELIX A. ALBALOS


OLITICS in Culion is un¬
known to outsiders and the
Manila press. Or, if known,
it may not be interesting to them.
But for the inmates confined in
Culion, politics in the colony pre¬
sents a happy break—one which
affords them the exercise of the
suffrage they have lost.
A blessing in disguise, for they
cause worries and discontentment
to disappear, temporarily at least,
colony politics differs from nation¬
al politics. Suffrage is more lib¬
eral. Women can vote although only
men can hold public office. A pri¬
vilege other women may well envy,
but women in the colony would pre¬
fer not to have this right if only
they can be free from their mis¬
fortune. Regarding qualifications
of voters, only that of age counts.
All inmates from eighteen to six-
ty years old can vote. It is always
a common sight on election day to
see invalids carried to the polling
places, giving more colour and in¬
terest to the event.
The colonists are grouped into
ten electoral regions.
They are: the Ilocano region
grouping into one all Ilocanos, Ca¬
gayanos, Pangasinanes, Zambalenos,
and other tribes from northern Lu¬
zon; the Pampangueno, Tagalog,
Bicolano, Ilongo, Cebuano, Leyte¬
no, Moro, Zamboangueno, and the
tribes composed of aliens and other
small tribes not included in any re¬
gion.
Each region elects, by popular
vote, a regional representative eve¬
ry two years. The elected repre¬
sentatives form the Culion advisory
board, an advisory body to the chief
of the colony. The chief acts as
chief executive and justice of the
peace ex-officio. The duties of the
advisory board are similar to that
of a town council. Likewise, mem¬
bers of the board act as interpre¬
ters to their respective regions and
may run for other board positions
as speaker, treasurer, secretary or
rations inspector.
Elevation to any of the coveted
posts in the board means higher
compensation, for whereas a mere
representative is paid by the num¬
ber of sessions held during the
month, the speaker receives P25.00
a month, the treasurer P20, and the
secretary P18. A rations inspector,
on the other hand, gets from P9 to
₱12 a month.
To become a representative is

not a tempting one if the meagre¬
ness of the salary is considered.
And a candidate spends much spe¬
cially if he has no backers to help
him in the expenses. Voters in the
colony are becoming wiser. Thus,
picnics, excursions, sponsoring of
baptisms or weddings, funerals, and
food during election day drain the
purse of a candidate. Besides, in
only such gatherings can a candi¬


date conduct his campaign; colony
regulations prohibit campaigning
by public meetings. But the surest
method is by going personally from
house to house or to dormitories,
accompanied by influential leaders.
Election last December was the


hottest ever held in the colony.
Candidates used campaign cards,
posters, and banners elaborately
painted, which were not used in pre¬
vious elections. There were also
protests brought to court in which

PROSPECT OF GARNERING FIRST PLACES SLIM, BUT P. I.
ATHLETES ARE DETERMINED TO DO THEIR BEST


Above are two of our best swimmers
Jikirum (left) and Ildefonso (center),
photegraphed with, a Japanese swimmer.
Jikirum and IIdefonso will probably be
included in the Philippine delegation to
the XIth Olympiad.
FIHE argument is: if Japanese
athletes can smash world re-
cords formerly he'd by the
Whites, why can’t Filipinos do the
same? Filipinos and Japanese
have the same—almost the same,
anyway—build, temperament, diet,
etc.
That argument, plus the world-
wide advertisement our participa¬
tion would give to the infant Com-
monwealth, prompted our assembly-
men to appropriate no less than
P60,000 for the expenses of some
hirty Filipino athletes who will
represent the Islands in the XIth
World Olympics to be held in Ber-
lin next August.
Accord’ng to National Physical
Director Ylanan, 10 basketball p'ay¬
ers are sure to be included in the
delegation. Our players have held
the Far Eastern championship since
1913 except once when China
grabbed it. There will be from 6
to 8 track and field men, 6 swim¬
mers, 4 boxers, 1 wrestler or weight
lifter. Three coaches will take care
of the boys.
This delegation will be the big-
gest to leave our shores for the
World Olympiad. In 1924, the first
time we were represented, only 1
athlete—Sprinter David Nepomu¬
ceno—was taken by Dr. Ylanan to
Paris. Four athletes—Teofilo Ilde-
fonso, Tuburan Tamse (swimmers),
Sprinter Gonzaga, and H’gh Jumper
Toribio—were sent to Amsterdam
in 1928 with Dr. Ylanan. In 1932,
U.P Prof. Bartolome headed a de-
legation of 7 athletes to the World


Olympics held in Los Angeles: Ilde¬
fonso, Jikirum, Ali, Toribio, and
Boxers Jose Villanueva and Carlos
and Jose Padilla.
Three of these—Ildefonso, Tori¬
bio, and Jikirum—are the only vete¬
rans who are almost sure of being
inc'uded in the delegation. The rest
will be picked from younger bloods.
According to their showings dur-
ing the last Far Eastern Olympics
and recent meets, the other mem¬
bers of the delegation will most
likely be picked from these: De
Leon, Guzman, Navallasca, May,
White, Candari (track and field);
Arasad and Francisco (swim¬
ming); P. Martinez, A. Pad Ta, J.
Cruz, C. Borck, Obordo, Suarez,
Siao, Marzan, Franco, M. Pardo
(basketball); Nunag, Placible, Lar¬
razabal, Gabuco, Castro (boxing).
This is the first time basketball
players are being sent from
I. to the World Olympics. In fact
it is the first time the Olympiad
recognizes basketball as an official
event. It has been known that the
U. S., China, Japan, and Egypt are
also sending basketball teams to
Berlin.
For the first time, also, a Filipino
weight lifter will most likely be in¬
cluded in the delegation. Cesar Ga¬
llegos (featherweight) and Santia¬
go Yangwas (middleweight) are the
local iron men who may make the
team. The P.A A.F recently
sent for an International Weight


Lifting set from the States to be
used by our lifters during the try-
outs.
In the first Olympic try-outs held
at the Rizal Memorial Field on the
25th and 26th of last month. the
Philippine and Far Eastern records
in the 400-meter relay were wrecked
by the U. P. team composed of
Navallasca, Cristobal, Candari, and
Guzman. The distance was nego¬
tiated by the quartet in 42 seconds
flat, snipping off 2410 and 3/10 of
a second from the Philippine and
Far Eastern records, respectively.
But the mere breaking of local
records cannot assure athletes of
inclusion in the Olympic team. An
athlete must approximate the 5th
or 6th place during the last two
World Olympic games so he could
be picked. According'y, the P.A.A.F.
has set a qualifying standard to
gauge the chances of local athletes
placing in the coming Olympics¬
This P.A.A.F. meter-stick, for
instance specifies that in the shot
put (16 pounds) the candidate must
heave the weight to a distance of
49 feet in order to qualify for the
team. The P I. record in this event
is 41 feet and 11 inches, estab¬
lished by Amante. That distance
may seem stupendous to local ath¬
letes but it is no less than 7 feet
short of the required distance,
which means we are definitely
counted out in that event. And
even granted that Amante could im¬

lifter who has a big chance of represent-
ing the P. I. in the Berlin Olympics.


prove till March so he could put the
shot at 49 feet, that would still be
over 3 feet short of the World
Olympic record and 8 feet behind
the world mark.
So far the only events in which
our athletes have equalled or im¬
proved the P.A.A. F. standard are
the 100-meter dash, 400-meter
hurdles, high jump, 200-meter
breast stroke, and 100-meter free
sty'e.
De Leon’s Philippine and Far
Eastern record of 10.6 seconds in
the century dash is 1,/10 of a second
better than that required by the
P. A. A. F. (Olympic—10.3, U.S.A.;
World—10.3, claimed by two Amer¬
icans and one Canadian.)

White’s time of 53 seconds in the
400-meter hurdles is exactly the
minimum specified by the P.A.A.F.
(Olympic—52, Hardin, U.S.; World
—50.6, Hardin.)
Toribio's Far Eastern record of
6 feet, 6-3,4 inches in the high
jump is 2 inches over the require¬
ment for inclusion in the team. But
he had better put himself back into
shape as in the first Olympic try-
outs, he made only over 6 feet 3,
which is below the standard. (Olym-
pic—6 feet, 6 inches, Osborn, U.S.;
Wor d—6 feet, 9-1/8 inches.)
Ildefonso’s Philippine and Far
Eastern record of 2:45.9 in the 200-
meter breast stroke is over 2 sec¬
onds better than the required time.
The veteran swimmer established
this record during the last Far East-
ern Olympics held in Manila, when
he outsprinted Koike. But the Jap-
anese world champion was not in
the pink of condition then; in the
trial heat he had made the distance
in 2:45.1 and in last August’s U.S.¬
Japanese dual meet in Japan, he
established a world record of 2:42.6.
Jikirum’s Philippine record of
59.8 seconds in the 100-meter free
style is 2410 of a second better
than the P.A.A F. standard for
that event. (Olympic—58, Miyaz-

Pedro Ponce, Mariano Ponce's
Son, Interested In Welfare Of
Masses —— Starts A Provincial
Paper
By APOLINAR V VICENTE


AST September 15, 1935, a
tiny bit of newspaper fit¬
M tingly named Baliwag was
born. It is a fortnightly in the
vernacular published in Baliwag,
Bulacan. We of Baliwag are na¬
turally proud of its birth, not only
because this is the first time that
a newspaper of its kind has been
published in our town, but also
because its editor and publisher
is no less than Pedro U. Ponce, son
of the late Filipino patriot and
journalist, Mariano Ponce.
While in Spain, we still recall,
the late Mariano Ponce, with Mar¬
celo H. del Pilar, Rizal, Lopez Jae¬
na, and others, founded "La Soli¬
daridad.” He was also director of
“El Renacimiento.” In his writ¬
ings he used the pseudonyms: "Na¬
" "Tikbalang," "Kalipulako."
ning,"


THE SURE WAY
TO FACE COMFORT


Use Mennen Lather Shave. Gives
a quick, copious lather in hot or
cold water, thoroughly wilts the
whiskers and provides a com¬
fortable shave. Use Mennen
Menthol-iced for its extra cooling
and stimulating effect.


Mennen Skin Bracer conditions
the skin. Cooling, soothing—has
a subtle, fascinating odor.


Mennen Talcum for Men has a
neutral tint, does not show, kills
face shine. Great after shaving
and bathing.


He wrote a book: “Sun Yat Sen,
Founder of the Chinese Republic."
As a diplomat, he served in vari¬
cus capacities, once as delegate
from Bulacan in the National As¬
sembly. No wonder, therefore, that
Ponce, the son, should inherit the
journalistic talent of his father.
Pedro U. Ponce could have lived
peacefully and contentedly. He
could have simply invested his
money in any secure business. But
as he himself said: “It is in my
blood. I cannot part with it. It ap-
peals to me most. I may not make
any profit—I may even lose—in
this venture, but I will carry it
through, because I know I am do¬
ing something for the enlighten¬
ment of the masses, the backbone
of the nation!"
That’s the kind of man editing
the Baliwag. Even as I entered his
office, I had at once an impression
of a different personality. Arrest-
ing slogans in bold types and nailed
to his office wall read: DO NOT
LOOK FOR SAFETY; LOOK FOR
ADVENTURE. And THE SAF¬
EST PEOPLE ARE IN JAIL AND
YET THEY ARE NOT PARTIC-
ULARLY HAPPY.
Editor Pedro U. Ponce, bespec¬
tacled, kind-hearted, courteous, and
patriotic answered my questions
readily.
“What prompted you to edit and
publish the Baliwag, Mr. Ponce?
“To lessen illiteracy at a mini¬
mum cost. (Baliwag, by the way,
is sold at one centavo per copy.)
We need a newspaper to educate
the masses at a cost they can af-
ford. It is regrettable to think
that majority of the barrio people
and field folks do not read news¬
papers. Why? Because they can¬
not afford to pay the high price of
metropolitan dailies. And besides,
these dailies hardly reach them.
Baliwag can reach them wherever
they are; and, as to price, who
could not afford to pay one centa¬
vo per copy? Besides, it is also my
aim to develop and enrich the Ta¬
galog language and to encourage
reading and writing. We have at
present budding writers who need
training. And incidentally, too,
this newspaper has been founded
to mold public opinion, and to raise
a voice of protest—however small
and weak it may be—against the
abuses of government officials with

a view to effect reforms."
Pedro U. Ponce is of Filipino¬
Japanese parentage. His mother
was Kiyo Udangawa (Maria Con¬
cepcion in Tagalog). He was born
in Yokohama, Japan, on August 4,
1901. He spent his early childhood
in Japan. Taken to Manila later,
he enrolled at the. Meisic Elemen¬
tary School. After finishing the
primary grades, he went to Bali¬
wag, his father’s home town and
studied at the Baliwag Interme¬
diate School, but due to poor health
he left school without finishing
the course.
On April 19, 1918, at the age of
17, he and his father made a plea¬
sure and educational trip to Hong¬
kong. While in Hongkong, hardly
after a month of sight-seeing, his
father died. Grief-stricken, he
brought Don Mariano Ponce’s re¬
mains home.
Being of an adventurous spirit,
he sailed for Japan on January 31,

1920; and on Jan. 16, 1924, he went
to the United States to study.
While there, however, he became
interested in Filipino movements
and fraternities. Instead of stu¬
dying he turned his attention to or¬
ganizing societies one of which was
the "Legionarios del Trabajo de
Filipinas. His countrymen knew
him for his rare talent and square
dealing. And, recognizing his jour¬
nalistic ability, he was offered to
edit the Tagalog section of "Phil-
ippine Independence,” then the
leading Filipino magazine in Cali¬
fornia.
After more than a year’s stay in
the United States, he became home¬
sick and sailed for home. Here, he
published the now defunct "Ang
Wika," and was also a regular con¬
tributor to "Ang Watawat.”
In 1931, during the height of the
Tanggulan movement, he was sus¬
pected as one of its leaders. That
was because of his revolutionary
tendencies which he inherited from
his father. And also because he is
a friend of Gen. Ricarte. His house
was searched by the authorities.
However, nothing of a seditious
nature was found in his possession.
As a matter of fact, he was not
really connected with the move-
ment.
Pedro U. Ponce’s life is crowded
with achievements. He was secre¬

the last elections. He is a captain

yHEN the name of Jose de
Wlos Reyes, retired colonel of
the Philippine constabulary
appeared on the front pages of
the metropolitan papers as Presid¬
ential choice for the position of
Chief of Staff of the newly created
Philippine army, there were not a
few who asked: “Who is this man?
Where did he come from and why
has he merited the joint confidence
of President Quezon and General
MacArthur?”
These inquiries were to be ex¬
pected. His name was never men¬
tioned previously for the
position and among our
public officials, he is per¬
haps the least publicized. So
unassuming is he and so re¬
solutely against publicity
that he himself said that
"my life has never been
put in print.
A silent worker and, as
one fellow officer said, "a
man entirely devoid of
vanity” General de los Re¬
yes d o es not like to
talk about himself. This
self-effacement the Chief
of Staff carries to the
extent of refusing to
talk on his previous ser¬
vices to the Philippine gov-
ernment. "Look up the
records and see what the
government archives have
about me,” he said in an¬
swer to our inquiries.
Those who do not know
what role “these records”
played in his selection to
the highest position in the
Philippine army will not
understand the reason be¬
hind his appointment and
why both President Quezon
and General MacArthur are
agreed that he is the best
man for the big job.
A faint hint of that rea¬
son may be gleaned from
President Quezon’s state¬
ment when he made public
the designation of former
Colonel Jose de los Reyes to
the new post. President Quezon
said:
“Col. Reyes has retired from the
constabulary since the year 1930,
and is now the chief of the secret
service division of the bureau of
customs. He is the senior officer
among all the living constabulary
native officers, and his record dur¬
ing all the years that he served
in the constabulary had been out¬
standing. His integrity and high
character, his ability and devotion
to duty is being recognized not only
throughout the organization which
he so faithfully and brilliantly
served, but throughout the country
as well. After hearing the opinion



adviser of this government, I have
come to the conclusion that for the
present this is the best appoint-
ment that can be made. (Italics
Ours.)
General Jose de los Reyes has,
his record since his appointment
shows, justified the President’s
confidence in him. His first of-
ficial acts: reorganizing the old
personnel of the Philippine con¬
stabulary and coordinating the
duties of the different units of the
insular police force throughout the
Philippines have proven this.


Gen. Jose de los Reyes
Chief Of Staff, Philippine Army
General Reyes comes from a fa¬
mily of farmers of average means
He was born in Bulacan, Bulacan,
on August 18, 1876 He studied in
his home town but his duties were
interrupted by recurrent troubles
during the Spanish regime. When
the revolution broke out he joined
the Filipino army and distinguished
hi ms elf for his bravery. A
sprightly young man, well-built,
his superior officers, even then
saw in this Bulakeno the makings
of a fine officer. They were
not in the least mistaken.
An instance during the revolution
when he showed extreme courage
and absolute fidelity to duty was


1899, he was ordered to report to
Col. Julian del Pilar of the revo¬
lutionary army. He was then
a lieutenant and was operating a
form of guerilla warfare under Col
del Pilar.
Once in the presence of Col, del
Pilar, he was informed of a very
delicate mission which he was to
perform. He was told that Gen¬
eral Antonio Luna was taking a
certain train and was going to
Nueva Ecija on a certain day. He
was directed to bring a platoon of
soldiers to a railroad station and
there kill the General.
The order was explicit
and brief, and it came from
a superior officer. Know¬
ing that orders were or¬
ders, he accepted the order
without a murmur. He in¬
wardly protested against it
and against the killing of
a capable general of the
army. But there was no
way out of the situation.
He gathered his trusted
men and waited at the rail¬
road statien. There he is¬
ed his instructions: “I
am boarding the train as
soon as it stops. Keep on
guard. I will invite Gen¬
eral Luna to go with me to
the platform and when 
raise my hat, fire.
"What about you?” in¬
quired his men in utter sur¬
prise
“That is my own predica¬
ment,” he snorted. “I have
my orders and you have
yours. You know what dis¬
obedience means in the
army.
Fortunately, General Lu¬
na did not take the trair
and was killed instead,
in Cabanatuan, Nueva Eci¬
ja. General de los Reyes
never explained what he
would do, but it was re¬
vealed that he had made his
decision to die with the
General, convinced that the
order given him, which he
could not disobey, was unjust
After the establishment of the
civil government here by the Amer
icans, and following the organiza¬
tion of the Philippine constabulary
De los Reyes saw an opportunity to
continue his military career and
enlisted.
He enlisted as a private in Bu¬
lacan on September 16, 1901. It
did not take him long, however, to
rise from the ranks. In a few
months, he was made corporal
From corporal, he was made ser¬
geant and from sergeant to first
sergeant, a rank then existing in
the Philippine constabulary. These
oromotions took place in less
inag one vear.  On the lasi das of


March, 1902, he was made sub-in¬
spector, a constabulary rank which
is no longer existing. In one year,
or on May 1, 1903, he was promoted
to the rank of third lieutenant al¬
though he had no training whatso¬
ever in any military school. For
two years, he remained as such. On
June 30, 1905, he was made second
lieutenant and was assigned to sev¬
eral provinces.
De los Reyes' next promotion
was on May 25, 1907, when he was
made first lieutenant. After two
years, he merited another promotion
and was designated captain On
June 7, 1917, or eight years since
his last promotion, he was appointed
major and held the position of prov¬
incial commander in many prov¬
inces.
On August 24, 1918, he was re¬
called to the central headquarters
and was appointed lieutenant col¬
onel and assistant chief of the Phil¬
ippine constabulary
On March 10, 1924, he attained
the rank of full colonel and held the
position of assistant chief. He re¬
tired on October 16, 1930, under
 a74 af the Administrative
Code as amejlea by Acs No 3205.

'What do you think is the name

GOOD CREDIT
FNDEPENDENCE missioners to
Washington have established a
Areputation for liberality when
it comes to money and so no Fili¬
pino finds difficulty in opening
credit with commercial houses in
the American capital.
Col. Paulino Santos, who joined
President Quezon in one of his
trips to the States, recounts that
while he was in Washington, D.C.,
he could have swindled business
houses, and even the banks, by
merely signing for the Philippine
independence mission.

FOLLOWED her, noticing the
pleasing contours of her
A young body as she stepped
lightly on the moist ground. It was
only nine and the sun had not as
yet completely evaporated the dew
from the soil. I walked a few me¬
ters behind her for she wore a
loose-bodied straight dressing gown
of thin and soft textile and the
morning sun was fine and bright.
Soon we reached their place and
up a flight of wooden stairs that
were clean but rotting and shaky
she went, while I hesitated at the
concrete landing, which was like
the stairs clean-swept but badly
cracked. Reaching the threshold, she
opened the door and turned about.
“Come up,” she said.
I wiped the soles of my shoes at
the stair-mat and went up, and
upon entering the door I instinct¬
ively tip-toed, following the girl’s
example, because seated in front of
a table by the left side of the door
was an old man with his head bowed
low on his breast, snoring loudly.
“My father," she said softly
when we were already seated, in¬
dicating the snoring old man whose
thin grey hair had not been cropped,
it seemed to me, for quite a long
time.
“Does he make all those things?”
I asked, also in a soft voice, not
wanting to disturb the old man, as
the room was rather small and


where we were seated by the win¬
dow fronting the street we could
easily disturb the dozing old man
For on the table propped against
the wall in front of the old man
was a big block of wood, on the lef¬
portion of which were carved, in
relief, figures that composed the
very popular conventional group of
the Holy Family at Bethlehem.
There was the kneeling figure of
Balthazar offering his gift to the
Baby, and there were the shepherds
with their sheep and cattle. One¬
half of the Virgin Mary and the
manger where lay the Child had al¬
ready been roughly carved, while
the other half, together with Jo¬
seph, Gaspar, and Melchor perhaps,
were lost in the flat surface of the
uncarved right portion of the wood.
Near this unfinished piece was an¬
other carving, completed and pol¬
ished—and it was already framed
—depicting a beautiful country
scene.
'He used to do that—before,
my hostess said, and I thought
there was a catch in her voice.
“He must be good,” I said.
For indeed, the framed country
scene on the table was one of the
finest pieces of wood carving I had
seen. The cogon shack beside the
bamboo clump, the country girl
feeding her chickens on the fore¬
ground; the man watering his ca¬
rabao near a well; the stack of hay


and the stretch of vacant paddies
in the background all were finely
and delicately executed.
“Yes,” she said. Father used to
make so many beautiful things be¬
fore.” She paused for a while to
swallow. Then she continued, “Do
you see that frame?”
I looked up to where her finger
had pointed and I saw, suspended
above the door, another framed
carving of a woman resembling my
hostess with a child on her lap.
“That’s mother and.... she be¬
gan.
"And you?”
“Yes.
She paused for a mo¬
ment. Then: “I was only three
then. So father told me.
"And now?” I asked. "How old
are you?
“Sixteen," she said. “Too old-
no?”
“Yes,” I said. "As old as a tooth
less baby. And beautiful, too
More beautiful than a new-born
baby."
And we both smiled. And soon
we forgot the dozing old man and
his wood carvings for our conver¬
sation had drifted to things about
ourselves. She asked so many
things: where I lived, how old
was, what I did for a living. And
I learned that her name was Ani
ta. Anita Gamboa. And the old
man, her father, Julio. And her
mother. Had she any mother? I


was just about to ask when she
stood up for we heard footsteps,
Anita opened the door and a
woman between thirty-five and
forty came in. I stood up and said
“Good morning," and she returned
my greetings with a smile. Then
she said, "Sit down.... sit down."
I noticed the woman had the nose
and eyes of Anita and she was
well groomed despite her greying
hair in a black camisa-and-skirt
terno. She carried a reed box in
one hand and a market-basket in
the other. Anita took the reed box

of her market-basket on the table
in front of the dozing old man.
“She’s beautiful.
“She ought to be,” Anita said
jokingly, "if she resembles me.
We laughed together rather loud¬
ly but Anita’s mother did not mind
us and went on with her sorting.
After a while, however, she asked
Anita to get some forks and sau¬

to locate among the vegetables and
the pieces of meat and pork, as she

y HEN one loves one’s Art no
service seems too hard.
That is our premise.
This story shall draw a conclusion
from it, and show at the same time
that the premise is incorrect. That
will be a new thing in logic, and
a feat in story-telling somewhat
older than the great wall of China.
Joe Larrabee came out of the
post-oak flats of the Middle West
pulsing with a genius for pictorial
art. At six he drew a picture of
the town pump with a prominent
citizen passing it hastily. This
effort was framed and hung in the
drug-store window by the side of
the ear of corn with an uneven
number of rows. At twenty he
left for New York with a flowing
necktie and a capital tied up some¬
what closer.
Delia Caruthers did things in
six octaves so promisingly in a
pine-tree village in the South that
her relatives chipped in enough in
her chip hat for her to go “North”
and “finish.” They could not see
her f—, but that is our story.
Joe and Delia met in an atelier
where a number of art and music
students had gathered to discuss
chairoscuro, Wagner, music, Rem¬
brandt’s works, pictures, Waldteu¬
fel, wall paper, Chopin and Oolong.
Joe and Delia became enamored
one of the other, or each of the
other, as you please, and in a short
time were married—for (see
above), when one loves one’s Art
no service seems too hard.


keep the chafing dish bubbling.
For two or three days she went
out canvassing for pupils. One
evening she came home elated.
“Joe, dear," she said, gleefully,
"I’ve a pupil. And, oh, the loveliest
people. General—General A. B.
Pinkney’s daughter—on Seventy¬
first street. Such a splendid house,
Joe—you ought to see the front
door! Byzantine I think you would
call it. And inside! Oh, Joe, I nev¬
er saw anything like it before.
“My pupil is his daughter Cle¬
mentina. I dearly love her already.
She’s a delicate thing—dresses al¬
ways in white; and the sweetest,
simple manners! Only eighteen
years old. I’m to give three lessons
a week; and, just think, Joe! $5 a
lesson. I don’t mind it a bit; for
when I got two or three more pu¬
pils I can resume my lessons with
Herr Rosenstock. Now, smooth out
that wrinkle between your brows,
dear, and let’s have a nice supper.”
“That’s all right for you, Dele,"
said Joe, attacking a can of peas
with a carving knife and a hatchet,
"but how about me? Do you think
I’m going to let you hustle for wa¬
ges while I philander in the regions
of high art? Not by the bones of
Benvenuto Cellini! I guess I can
sell papers or lay cobblestones, and
bring in a dollar or two."
Delia came and hung about his
neck.
“Joe, dear, you are silly. You
must keep on at your studies. It is
not as if I had quit my music and


A SERVICE Of LOVE


By O. HENRY


Mr. and Mrs. Larrabee began
housekeeping in a flat. It was a
lonesome flat—something like the
A sharp way down at the left-hand
end of the keyboard. And they
were happy; for they had their
Art, and they had each other. And
my advice to the rich young man
would be—sell all thou hast, and
give it to the poor—janitor for the
privilege of living in a flat witl.
your Art and your Delia.
Flat-dwellers shall indorse my
dictum that theirs is the only true
happines,. Ii a home is happy it
cannot fit too close—let the dresser
collapse and become a billiard ta¬
ble; let the mantel turn to a rowing
machine, the escritoire to a spare
bedchamber, the washstand to an
upright piano; let the four walls
come together, if they will, so you
and your Delia are between. But
if home be the other kind, let it be
wide and long—enter you at the
Golden Gate, hang your hat on Hat-
teras, and your cape on Cape Horn
and go out by the Labrador.
Joe was painting in the class of
the great Magister—you know his
fame. His fees are high; his les¬


sons are light—his highlights have
brought Eim renown. Delia was
studying under Rosenstock—you
knoy his repute as a disturber of
(ne piano keys.
They were mighty happy as long
as their money lasted. So is every
—but I will not be cynical. Their
arms were very clear and defined.
Joe was to become whiskers and
thick pocketbooks would sandbag
one another in his studio for the
privilege of buying. Delia was to
become familiar and then contemp-
tuous with Music, so that when she
saw the orchestra seats and boxes
unsold she could have sore throat
and lobster in a private dining¬
room and refuse to go on the stage.
But the best, in my opinion, was


the home life in the little flat—the
ardent, voluble chats after the day’s
study; the cozy dinners and fresh,
light breakfasts; the interchange
of ambitions—ambitions interwoven
each with the other’s or else incon¬
siderable—the mutual help and in¬
spiration; and—overlook my art-
lessness—stuffed olives and cheese
sandwiches at 11 P. M.
But after a while Art flagged. It
sometimes does, even if some
switchman doesn’t flag it. Every¬
thing going out and nothing com¬
ing in, as the vulgarians say. Mon¬
ey was lacking to pay Mr. Magis¬
ter and Herr Rosenstock their pri¬
ces. When one loves one’s Art no
service seems too hard. So, Delia
said she must give music lessons to


gone to work at something else.
I am always with my music. And
we can live as happily as million¬
aires on $15 a week. You mustn’t
think of leaving Mr. Magister."
“All right," said Joe, reaching
for the blue scalloped vegetable
dish. “But I hate for you to be
giving lessons. It isn’t Art. But
you’re a trump and a dear to do
it.
“When one loves one’s Art no
service seems too hard," said Delia.
“Magister praised the sky in
that sketch I made in the park,"
said Joe. "And Tinkle gave me per¬
mission to hang two of them in his
window. I may sell one if the right
kind of a moneyed idiot sees them."
“Im sure you will,” said Delia,
sweetly. “And now let’s be thank¬
ful for Gen. Pinkney and this veal
roast."
During all of the next week the
Larrabees had an early breakfast.
Joe was enthusiastic about some
morning-effect sketches he was
doing in Central Park, and Delia
packed him off breakfasted, cod¬
dled, praised and kissed at 7

purely scientific study of nature has never really inter¬
A ested me. I am less interested in the law of gravitation
than in Who made it; nor am I captivated by the weight of plan¬
ets and suns, the gases surrounding them, their distances from
us. An older question fascinates me: Whose hand was it that
set their delicate balance, started them at cyclone speed, holds
them now in their vast orbits? The pure scientist will say
something about natural law; but law is a thing that is made
or established. Behind everything in the universe my mind sees
and my heart feels the presence of the Maker. Science, if I may
presume to say so, has not gone far enough. It declares that
certain effects are truth: but is it not going to include cause
also as a truth, and an older and deeper one than what it pro¬
duces? It seems to me utterly natural and reasonable to declare
that Someone throned the mountains in the high azure, set the
wild sea’s boundary.


COURTESY
By HENRY MORTON ROBINSON


RE
NOURTESY is not the king of virtues, but it is certainly
Gone of his noblest aides. I suppose its true function is to
lubricate the surface of those countless casual human contacts
in which our deeper emotions are not called into play. It is
so valuable a human commodity that we are justified in extend¬
ing ourselves mightily to promote it; if it comes freely we are
fortunate, but when it is stingily offered we must not be afraid
to demand a more generous share. I do not mean to suggest
that we should go about the world bellowing complaints at
tired, overworked servitors; there are dozens of occasions daily
in which restraint and patient silence are the only courses open
to the considerate man or woman. But if discourtesy is to be
checked, heroic methods must be invoked. We must boldly speak
up for good manners and let our voices be heard in every
boorish corner of the world.

Genius Im Imsane
ASvIums
By PROF. RALPH CARSON, M.D.


When a person loses his mind
you will say, naturally, that he loses
his usefulness. Generally, per¬
haps, but not always. The adop-
tion of the present humane treat¬
ment of the insane in the United
States is due to the work of a
man who after losing his mind and
staying in an asylum regained his
mental powers. After his dis¬
charge from the asylum he worked
for a more human treatment of in¬
sane persons and succeeded. And
even some of those who have not
regained their mind fully have ex¬
hibited rare usefulness, if only in
one direction. This may be hard
to believe but the following exam¬
ples should be convincing.
BOUT 6000 articles in the lat-
est edition of the British
AAEncyclopedia, which counts
hundreds of specialists and scien¬
tists among its contributors, were
written by Bernard Chaucer, Ph.
D., a former lecturer in archeology
at the University of London, Eng¬
land, and for the past thirty years
an inmate of the Broadmoor luna¬
tic asylum. For this highly intelli¬
gent and creative man is an incur¬
able lunatic and a danger to so¬
ciety.
Chaucer was interned after he
had pulled a revolver from his
pocket during one of his lectures
and fired several shots into the
audience, seriously wounding sev¬
eral students. During the first
years of his internment he gave no
sign of improvement. Then he
gradually began to take an interest
in science and to write, asking that
his articles be sent to the editor of


Inmates of a city asylum. Not all who
lose their mind cease to be useful. Ge
ninses thrive even within hospitals for
the insane.


the British Encyclopedia, who at
once became interested in them.
Since then Chaucer has been a
regular contributor although his
whereabouts is no secret to his
employers.
Not far from Buffalo there is an
asylum for millionaires, a real gar¬
den-city with clubs, golf links
and tennis courts, swimming
pools, etc. One of the boarders¬
for you would hardly call them in¬
mates—a certain John Brian, an
engineer of fifty who had made a
fortune with a technical invention
but lost most of it in the slump,
was to be transferred to a more
modest home since he was no
longer able to pay the high price.
But he was not insane enough not


to realize that he would not feel so
well anywhere else and he began to
ponder over a way out of his di¬
lemma and found it.
During several weeks he assidu¬
ously studied treatises on economics
and stock exchange bulletins and
got in touch with a banker who
promised to help him. And now
he has made enough money not
only to pay for his upkeep but has
practically rebuilt his lost for¬
tune by his subtle speculations.
Whence comes this flair and long-
sightedness in financial operations
to a man, disturbed in his brain
and who in his good days had never
concerned himself with stock ex¬
change business? This is a mys¬
tery which will never be solved, but
apart from it the man is hopelessly
insane. He covers the walls with
rhymes that betray the mentality
of a little child, he walks about on
all hours in the garden and sprin¬
kles his attendants with any bev¬
erage he can get hold of.


When the talkies came into fash-
ion, Hollywood at once developed a
great demand for catchy tunes and
songs, the supply of which is never
so great as the need. We may im-
agine the delight of the company
to whom an agent submitted a do¬
zen compositions, one more thril-
ling than the other. After a few
months another supply of songs
arrived, all composed by a certain
Paul Lovewell, absolutely unknown
in musical circles. The truth leaked
out when the company tried to sign
him up.
Since 1917 Lovewell has been an
inmate of a Chicago asylum. He
was wounded in the head in the
world war and his brain was so
damaged that he was unable to
continue his banking career. His
progressive madness finally neces¬
sitated internment. The remark¬
able thing about Lovewell is that
before the war he had never speci¬
ally concerned himself with music.
He did play the piano a little but

A as yet startled the world
with an invention, a scientific
book, a novel or a seat in the le¬
gislature, do not give .up hope.
Just keep on trying. For many a
great man showed signs of great¬
ness when he is already well ad¬
vanced in years.
Bacon, it is said, outlined his
"Novum Organum” at the age of
fifteen—a statement difficult to
believe—but completed it for pub¬
lication at the age of fifty-nine.
Kant wrote his “Estimate of Liv.
ing Force” at twenty-three, but
published his “Critique of Pure
Reason" when fifty-seven. Handel
and Meyerbeer, both precocious
composers, wrote, the former his
oratorio, The Triumph of Time, at
seventy-two; and the latter, at the
same age produced his opera,
D'Africaine. Verdi, at seventy-one,
composed his masterpiece, Othello,
and his other brilliant work, Fal¬
staff, in his eightieth year. Victor

ent has developed with his insanity.
Musie see, the most common
of aptitudes leveloped along with
madness. One American asylum
has its own orchestra of twenty¬
four inmates so well trained that
they give public concerts. A violin¬
ist interned in a Milwaukee insti¬
tution plays the Ave Maria so per¬
fectly and with so much feeling
and expression that the greatest
musicians kave listened to him
with amazement. Yet he is unable
to play any other melody, and, if
leit to himself, will readily throw
his violin at his audience.


To Do Things
WorthWhile
By FRANK CLINGER SCALLAN


Hugo, at seventy-five, wrote “The
History of Crime”"; at seventy-
seven, "Le Pape”; at seventy-eight,
“L'Ane”; at seventy-nine, "Les
Quatre Vents de PEsprit"; and at
eighty, “Torquemada. Humboldt
began to write, at seventy-six, his
great work “Kosmos," and finished
it at eighty. Lamarck completed
his famous zoological treatise, “The
Natural History of the Inverte¬
brates" at seventy-eight. Goethe
completed his Faust when eighty
and Ranke commenced at this ad¬
vanced age his "History of the
World," and actually lived to com¬
plete it: he died at ninety-one. Ten¬
nyson was eighty-three when he
wrote “Crossing the Bar.” Walter
Savage Landor wrote his "Imagin¬
ary Conversations" at eighty-five.
As examples of physical as well
as mental strength in old age, we
have Von Moltke, who was Chief
of Staff of the Prussian army at
eighty-eight; John Wesley, who
was constantly travelling, and
preached almost daily at the same
age; and Gladstone who began his
great Midlothian campaign at
eighty, and became Prime Minis¬
ter, for the fourth time, at eighty-
three. Two great artists, and a
noted actor performed immortal
work at advanced ages. Michael
Angelo, at eighty-nine, was busily
engaged on his great frescoes; that
other master, Titian, painted his
“Battle of Lepanto" at ninety¬
eight; and Charles Macklin, the
Shakespearean actor, performed at
Covent Garden Theatre as “Mac¬
beth" at eighty-four, and as "Shy-
lock" at ninety-nine.
In our own times the list of the
mentally virile in old age includes
such illustrious names as Clemen¬
ceau, the "Tiger”; Lord Roberts,
and Generals Joffre and Foch;
Thomas Edison, who produced in¬
ventions that have benefited the
world when he was already long
past middle age; Robert Dollar,
the founder of the Dollar Steam¬
ship Lines, who died recently at
the age of eighty-eight, and was
convinced he had accomplished
more in his later years than before
he had reached sixty. Of those
still with us, and still at work, the
most prominent, perhaps, are Pres¬
ident Masaryk, the efficient head
of the Czechoslovakian Republic,
now eighty-four, Mr. Henry Ford,


Thomas Edison: produced inven¬
tions that have benefited the morld
when he was already long past mid¬
dle age.
the poet Rabindranath Tagore, and
that outstanding example of inde¬
fatigable physical and mental
energy, George Bernard Shaw,
who, vigorous at seventy-four, re¬
cently circumnavigated the world.
Age most frequently, if not in¬
variably, implies experience, and
the "smack of age” that has
acquired "some relish of the salt-
ness of time” is still valuable in
the affairs of life.


Bottomless Pail
Serves As Funnel
Inserted into the mouth of a
grain sack that is being filled, a
bottomless pail provides a good fun¬
nel. The pail is held in the sack by
a helper and makes a rigid opening
into which the material can be
scooped without any possibility of
the mouth of the sack sagging,
which often happens when the sack
is held without a rigid support. By
rigging up a post to hold the sack
and pail, one man can fill it.


Pail with bottom removed holds the
mouth of a sask when it is being filled.


The daitiness of true cleanliness


The daintiness and charm of a fas¬
tidiously groomed woman does not
come by chance. It arises from
attention to the little details of the
toilette so often neglected or mis¬
understood. Beautiful clothes, lux¬
urious cosmetics, beauty of face and
figure—even these may fail to create
charm if a woman neglects to give
her body meticulous care.


Lysol is "Safe”
For 5o years, doctors and hospi¬
tals the world over have relied on
"Lysol” for the most critical disin¬
fectant purposes — for example in

be thorough and without possible
risk of injury. Surely then, "Lysol"

Flagrant Violation
There is, of course, no specific
provision in the Constitution
which prohibits the President of
the Commonwealth from liberating
criminals, and, more specifically,
ordering the release of “Capitan
Kulas” Encallado. Those who
would court favors from the Chief
Executive may allege that what is
not provided in the Constitution
cannot be violated, hence, the act
of the President is far from con¬
troversy, with the ultimate conclu¬
sion that it is constitutional.
There is, however, a provision of
law, Article 223 of the Revised
Penal Code, pertinent thereto, and
which reads as follows:
“Any public officer who shall
consent to the escape of a pris¬
oner in his custody or charge,
shall be punished by prision cor¬
reccional, in its minimum period
and temporary special disqualifi¬
cation, if the fugitive shall not
have been finally convicted but
only held as a detention prisoner
for any crime or violation of law
or municipal ordinance."
President Quezon, Governor Ma¬
ximo Rodriguez, and General Jose
de los Reyes are public officers.
They are those persons "who by
direct provision of the law, pop-
ular election or appointment by
competent authority, shall take
part in the performance of public
functions in the Government of
the Philippine Islands, or shall per¬
form in said government or in any
of its branches, public duties as an
employee, agent or subordinate of¬
ficial, of any rank or class.” In
the case of Gimenea, Vol. 24, Phil.
Reports 464, a constabulary officer
is a public officer. This, by ana¬
logy, includes the General.
Some would assert that En-
callado could be set free under the
conditions agreed upon between
him and President Quezon, General
de los Reyes, and Governor Rodri¬
guez because he (Encallado) was
not under arrest. It is observed
there was no warrant of arrest
served on him nor was he caught
about to commit an offense. Much
more, he was the one who surren¬
dered.
These allegations are immaterial
and fallacious because Encallado

was under arrest. Arrest signifies
“the apprehension or detention of
the person in order to be forthcom-
ing to answer for an alleged or sus¬
pected crime or to prevent the com¬
mission of a criminal offense.” The
government officials I have named
above have abetted by deciding
among themselves the escape of
Encallado. Whether Encallado re¬
turns, as promised, or not, is be¬
yond the point at issue. The law
did not place in the hands of these
officials the power to effect a com
promise with criminals in the way
they did. Escape, legally speak¬
ing, is avoiding a threatened peril
or jeopardy in the courts of jus¬
tice. “Capitan Kulas,” having been
set free, has been given this
chance.
I submit that the combined acts
of President Quezon, General Jose
de los Reyes, and Governor Ma¬
ximo Rodriguez are flagrant vio¬
lations of the Revised Penal Code
provision referred to.

What If They're Moros?
I wonder why Moros are always
held in low esteem. In society, they
are shunned, held as outcasts,
People dislike them and fear them.
Whenever immigration to Min¬
danao is suggested to solve the un¬
employment problem, there always
arise that reluctance and pessi¬
mism among Luzon brothers
brought about by the thought of
fierce Moros.
But what kind of people are
Moros anyway? Are they not Fili¬
pinos? Do they not know what is
right and what is wrong? Do they
not eat rice and fish as you and I
do? Did they not fight for free¬
dom during the Spanish regime?
Are all Moros uneducated and
wild? Are there no intelligent
Moros and Moro politicians who
could tackle the economic and pol¬
itical problems of the Islands? Are
they not, as proven, willing to lend
a helping hand in the molding of
the Philippines for a sound and
secure future?
Don’t have any misconception
about the Moros. Take away your
regional prejudice and be friends
with them. Moros are also true¬


blooded Filipinos, and were born in
the same archipelago where Rizal
was born.

A Reply
Should teachers lose their pen¬
sion as proposed by Assemblyman
Nuyda?
In the approval of Act No. 3050,
known as the Teachers' Pension
Law, which took effect in 1920, a
contract was entered into between
the government and the teachers.
As required by Act 3050, teachers
have to deposit three per cent of
their salaries to the credit of the
Teachers' Pension and Disability
Fund and render efficient and sat¬
isfactory service for at least twenty
years. The government, for its
part, must deposit to the credit of
the same fund an amount equal to
the teachers’ contribution, and as¬
sume the obligation of pensioning
the teachers at the end of twenty
years or more.
Now, Mr. Nuyda wants this pen¬
sion stopped for, as he says, there
is a deficit. He wants the govern¬
ment to repudiate its obligation to
the teachers and pensionees. To do
that would mean disappointment,
discontent, unrest, and loss of
faith and confidence in our leaders.
The teachers’ pension fund is
around P18,000,000. The annual
income is P2,000,000. One million
comes from the government and
teachers’ contributions; the other
₱1,000,000 from the interest in in-
vestments. Since payments from
this fund were less than P800,000
in 1934, payments in 1935 should
not be more than P900,000.
Now, then, how could there be a
deficit? Has the P18,000,000 dis¬
appeared in smoke? If so, why
was nobody criminally prosecuted
for the recovery of the funds? And,
taken for granted that the fund
disappeared, who was to blame?
Why penalize the teachers and
those pensioned for the mistakes
of other people?

Criticising A Critic
On this page, I frequently come
across the name of Mr. Rizal Pas¬
trana, from Banga, Capiz. He has
been commenting on the works of
poets and writers with impunity.
He said Garcia Villa is not an
equal to any of the local poets like
Manalang, Faigao, Dato or Pe¬
layo. I ask him: has he written
anything, a poem, a short story;
or has he even been winning once
in this weekly’s students’ literary


Edward J. O'Brien is probably best known now as a critic of the short-
story. He has, however, done creative work, of which the poem below is
a sample.
Hellenica
CLEON doth not forget the gentle footsteps
Of Scylla, a little maiden,
Who returneth not unto her father’s dwelling
But walketh the long descent into the silence
Tired and alone.
II
Rhodoclea, whose body veiled the sun,
Hath fallen into shadow
Under the grasses.
III
Plato’s passion troubled Timon’s soul,
His body followed beauty to the end.
Sunlight sifts across his earthy bed.

Local Women Athletes
ry 10 Juallly Por
berin Siympics


SYFVIS better to have tried and
lost than never to have
tried at all. This version of
the now famous line of Tennyson
may be considered the motto of
the local women athletes when it
comes to trying for the Eleventh
World Olympics scheduled to
take place in Berlin this coming
August. Although conscious that,
except for a miracle, they cannot
now approach the records made
by women in the last Olympics
held in Los Angeles, California,
just the same they participated in
the try-outs for the coming Olym¬
pics which was held by the Philip-
pine Amateur Athletic Federation
at the Rizal Memorial Stadium
last month. The winners in these
try-outs, however, had the conso¬
lation of having been declared
1936 national champions.
These women athletes are still
young, some of them still imma¬
ture. With the proper training
they might qualify for the 1940
Olympics. Dr. Regino Ylanan,
national physical education director,
however, says that the Philippines
cannot hope to develop women ath-
letes who will qualify for the World
Olympics even after ten years.
Moreover, women’s participation in
competitive track and field events
and swimming is quite recent. The
inclusion of athletic events for wom-
en in the Olympics started only in
1928. This means that at the
Olympics in Berlin, women will
be participating only for the third
time.
“It is, however, very encouraging
to note that the objection of par¬
ents, in particular, and of the pub¬
lic, in general, to shorts, bathing
suits, and other abbreviated cost-
umes that are necessary for active
sports is fast disappearing. Add to
this the increasing interest of the
girls in athletics, and we can hope
to develop real athletes among our
women in the future. How soon
this will be, will depend upon the
interest that our girls will show in
athletics and the encouragement
that will be given to them,” Dr.
Ylanan said.
Mrs. Ylanan, physical education
director of the Philippine Women’s
University, however, bemoans the
fact that the lack of facilities and
of competition will make local girls
lose their interest in athletics. At


present, there are only four schools
that include track and field events
in their respective athletic pro¬
grams. These are the Philippine
Women’s University, the Central
School, and the Mapa High School
in Manila and the Alaminos Aca¬
demy in Pangasinan. Competition
in track and field events, therefore,

is limited only to these four
schools. As for swimming, there
are three schools that count with
swimming pools: the University of
the Philippines, the University of
Santo Tomas, and the Philippine
Women’s University. It is only the,
last one that has a women’s swim¬
ming team.
While it is true that there is a
growing interest in athletics among
women in the Philippines, this in-

terest is bound to die if facilities
for training them are not made
available. The PWU, the Mapa
High School, and the Central School
send their respective teams in track
and field to the Rizal Memorial
Stadium for practice because they
do not have their own athletic
fields. Even the PWU which
counts with a swimming pool, sends


her swimmers to the Rizal Nata¬
torium for practice since its own
pool is small and is only suitable
for teaching swimming.
For comparison, here are the
records made by women in the 1932
Olympics in Los Angeles, Califor¬
nia, and those made by our women
in the try-outs for the coming
Olympics in Berlin:

“The lack of facilities in schools
tends to discourage girls from tak¬
ing active part in athletics, or from
practising,” says Mrs. Ylanan
Speaking of her own experiences,
she says that although the girls in
the Philippine Women’s University
are interested enough in athletics,
she has to go after them constantly
to practise. She has to round them
up to take them to the Rizal Me¬
morial Stadium in the afternoon of
every practice day. Fortunately,
her school is near the Rizal Sta¬
dium and a bus is available for the
transportation of the girls.
It is interesting to note that
while the records made by the
women athletes who took part in
the try-outs for the Olympics did
not even approximate the records
made by women in the last Olympics,
three local women’s records were
smashed, showing that our women
athletes have improved. The rec-
ords broken were those in the javel-
in throw which was broken by Vio¬
leta Verdote of the PWU, the 80-
meter hurdles by Shirley Urquico
of the Central School, and the high
jump by Daisy Patterson also of
the Central School.
Among Eastern countries, only
Japan sent women participants in
the last Olympics at Los Angeles.
The Japanese women made quite a
good showing, one of them winning


second place in the 400-meter free
style swimming, another, fourth
place in the javelin throw The
Japanese team also won fifth place
in the 100-meter relay and also
fifth place in the 400-meter relay
in swimming, among women.

STUFFED ONIONS


In Two Styles


Stuffed Onions, garnished with mashed potatoes, peas, and mushrooms.
(Courtesy, Genato Commercial Company)


Stuffed Onions
6 large onions
M cup chopped ham or chop¬
ped green peppers
La cup soft bread crumbs
La cup milk
Pepper to taste
M teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon fat
Remove a slice from the top of
each onion and parboil the onions
until tender. Drain and remove
the centers, leaving six little cups.
Chop the onion that was scooped
out and combine it with the
chopped ham or peppers and
cook in the fat. Add the bread
crumbs. Season and refill the
onion cups with this mixture. Place


them in a baking dish, cover with
bread crumbs, add the milk, and
bake in a quick oven. Garnish with
mashed potatoes and a border of
green peas upon serving.—Delinea¬
tor.
Planked Stuffed Onion
6 large onions
3 tablespoons fat
2 cups corned beef
Mashed potatoes
Peas (canned)
Mushrooms (sauted)
Peel and cook the onions until
almost tender in plenty of boiling
water. Drain and allow to cool.
Slice off the top of each and scoop
out the center. Chop about 1/2 cup
of the onion that has been scooped


out and cook slightly in the fat.
Add the corned beef and season to
taste with salt and pepper. Stuff
the onions with this mixture and
bake in a hot oven for 20 minutes,
or until slightly brown. Grease a
plank or a platter and arrange the
stuffed onions in the center. Using
a pastry bag, make a border of
mashed potatoes around the onions
and on the edge of the plank or plat¬
ter. Brown in a hot oven. Pile hot,
buttered green peas between the
potato borders. Garnish the tops
of the onions with sauted mush-
rooms.—MeCall.
Pork Birds
1 kilo pork steaks (from
shoulder or neck)
1,2 cup seedless raisins
2 cups dry bread crumbs
3,4 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
Salt, pepper, and lemon juice
2 tablespoons flour
2 tablespoons hot fat
1 cup water
Cut the pork meat into 6 or more
oblong pieces and pound each piece
until thin. Rub each piece with a
mixture of 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4
teaspoon pepper, and 2 teaspoons of
lemon juice. Mix the raisins, bread
crumbs, milk, and 1 teaspoon salt
together. Spread this mixture on


each piece of meat, roll up, and se¬
cure with a piece of string or with
a toothpick. Dredge the rolls with
flour and brown in the fat. Add the
water, cover, and cook over a slow
fire for about 20 minutes or until
tender. Before serving, remove the
string or the toothpicks, and pour
gravy over the rolls.
With pork birds, serve creamed
green beans and shredded lettuce
salad. Here is the recipe for
creamed green beans:
Creamed Green Beans
4 cups green beans, cut
into short pieces
6 cups boiling water
1 12 tablespoons butter
1 142 tablespoons flour
3,4 teaspoon salt
A pinch of pepper
3,4 cup evaporated milk, di¬
luted with
3,4 cup liquid from the beans
Cook the beans in the boiling wa¬
ter, uncovered, until tender. Drain
off the liquid and save to dilute the
milk. Melt the butter on the top of
a double-boiler. Blend the flour,
salt, and pepper and stir into the
melted butter. Stir in slowly the
milk and the liquid from the beans.
Cook this mixture for 10 minutes,
stirring all the time. Then add the
beans and heat thoroughly. Serve
at once.

TWO CREATIONS BY MERCEDES ICO
The increasingly popular jusi lends itself beautifully to the fashioning
of both the European and the Filipino costumes for affernoon or eve¬
ning wear, as shown by these fwo original designs.


The European evening gown in
natural or pastel-colored jusi is
cut in the bias for a perfect fit.
The collar, the edge of the pe¬
plum, and the edge of the skirp
are trimmed wih hand-painted or
embroidered leaves in dark green,
brown or black.
The Filipino dress is trimmed
with embroidered orchid flowers
and appliqued leaves. The skirt
of jusi is cuf in the bias and has
a round train. Note that the em¬
broidery on the skirt is placed on¬
ly on one side like a corsage.
In these fwo designs, Miss Ico
has introduced the use of mango
leaves as in the European cos¬
tume, and of the orchid, as in
the Filipino costume, as decora-
tions, thus making her creations
distinctly native.

PRHOSE who hate to go through
the contents of the laundry
pag or basket to count them
before giving them to the washer
woman will welcome this sugges¬
tion from a woman who, hating
housekeeping, has found many
ways of making her tasks easier:
Take a piece of ruled paper and
write down on the left side and one
below the other, all the items that
usually find their way into the
laundry bag. Place this list on the
wall above or anywhere near the
laundry bag. At the end of the
week or when the time for giving
the laundry to the washerwoman
comes, simply add up the circles or
the checks after each item. This
list is kept for checking up the
laundry when the washerwoman
brings it in.
The listing down of pieces that
are put into the bag must be done
faithfully and accurately so that the
list will tally with the contents of
the bag.
Uses of Olive Oil
LIVE oil has many uses other
than for making a dressing
for salads or for cooking. A little
olive oil rubbed over the gray out¬
line that is a water stain will re¬
move it. Follow the oil treatment
by rubbing the spot gently with a
soft cloth to remove the excess oil.
Water stains should be attended to
within a day or two after occur¬
ring.
Olive oil will also remove perfume
stains from the wooden top of your
vanity table.
An occasional olive oil rub-down


will keep furniture in heated rooms
from drying out or the varnish from
cracking.
Tinting Lingerie
Y INGERIE, especially the pastel
E tel-colored, must be tinted oc¬
casionally to preserve its dainty ap¬
pearance. A faded blue garment will
tint a delicate orchid with the aid
of pink dye. A pale yellow will shade
into a delicate green if dipped in
blue dye, and pink dye will change
the yellow into shell pink. Be sure
to use small quantities of the dye
for making pastel shade solutions.
Keeping Paint
FTER using paint, if there is
A still some left in the can and
you wish to keep it for latter use,
just add enough water to cover.
When ready, pour off the water
and the paint will be free from
scum and dirt.
Fifteen Minutes A Year
ySE fifteen minutes each year
to take an oil can and put a
drop of light lubricating oil on each
door hinge, door knob, and doon
latch in the house. They will work
more easily and last many years
longer than otherwise.

should, it is possible that you are
washing them in too hot water er
ironing them with a very hot iron
For these materials the water
should be about the temperature of
your hand. Remember that rayon
and similar materials lose strength
while wet, and it is, therefore, im¬
portant to avoid twisting and pul¬
ling or rubbing them while wash-
ing or rinsing them. After silks
and rayons have been washed
and rinsed, they should be squeezed
gently between the hands to remove
as much water as possible from
them and then they should be rolled
in towels to remove excess moisture.
Iron them with a slightly warm iron
while they are still damp.
Do you let your silk underwear
get bone dry and then sprinkle it
when ready for ironing? Then you
may find faint spots on these gar-
ments, as water spots some silks.
To avoid this roh each arti¬
cle in a lamp cloth and leave it
there for a few minutes. It will be
evenly moist and can be ironed ea¬

There is nothing more flattering to a mature figure than
drapery. If is soffening, feminine, and right now, the height of
smartness. On this page are shown fhree frocks made from plain¬
colored, heavy silk. The frock at the righf has a modified harem skirt,
with a draped panel slit af the botfom in the center front. The frock
in the cenfer will perhaps remind older women of a fashion nof
long ago featuring draping in the skirt and blouse thaf falls from
a fan of fine shirring. The wrap-around skirt is slenderizing. The
last frock has a draped blouse and a skirf with a liffed hemline in
the front, which make the skirf billow as you walk. This feature is
achieved by means of a panel that is exfra wide at the boffom.

Mercolized Wax
Restores Skin Beauty)
A man, aaa Min VIN a an
cate peach-like bloom, is one of the Creator's
most exquisite works. When the first blush
of youth is over, this beautiful tint and sa¬
tiny lustre are rarely seen. How to preserve
them—that’s the question. Mercolized Wax
works wonders in this direction. It actually
gives a new surface to the skin, restoring
that marvelous girlish color and softness in
a remarkable manner. Mercolized Wax will
convert a faded, wornout or discolored com¬
plexion into one of captivating loveliness.
Mercolized Wax is simple to use, too. Just
pat it on at night like cold cream and wash
off in the morning. Mercolized Wax brings
out the hidden beauty of your skin. At all
drug and department stores.

the blouse and ending in upstanding collar, as shown by e model in the center, is new and

formality, choose a print with a dark background, made ke the dress af the right. The ver¬
tical shirrings on the blouse and sleeves are new. ront fullness in the skirt is achieved by
means of panels. (Butterick Fashion Magazine)

double chin is usually asso¬
ciated only with age or with
Aplumpness, but it is not
infrequent to see girls and even
skinny women with double chins.
In the case of girls with double
chins the cause is, more often
than not, a faulty posture, es¬
pecially when reading, in bed
or seated. Instead of holding
the book up to their eyes, they
bring down their heads to the book.
The trouble with the problem of
the double chin is that, unlike many
other beauty problems, it does not
happen overnight. We are so ap¬
pallingly oblivious to what goes on
in our faces and figures because we
are used to seeing them that
even though a flabby chin or a
“crepy” throat gives us sufficient
warning of its approach, we don’t
catch it in its early stages and deal
with the trouble firmly. The motto
about an ounce of prevention being
better than a pound of cure applies
especially to the double chin prob-

Many women forget their necks when
they cleanse or make-up their faces,
with the result that their necks look
different from their faces — darker and
older in appearance. Maureen O'Sullivan
is here shown applying a foundation lo¬
tion on her neck to make it look as
white as her face.

Vigorous and rapid patting with the
back of the hand for the plump per¬
son with a double chin. The patting
should be finished with an application
of astringent.


lem, for a double chin is so much
easier to prevent than to correct.
This is sound, fundamental ad-
vice, but it is difficult to make a
girl of eighteen, for instance,
whose chin-line is so firm and
whose throat is so smooth she re-
gards them as unchangeable, to
realize its importance. It takes the
sudden fright at the first wrink-
ling of the skin or the first sug¬
gestion of an additional chin to
startle us into action, ordinarily.
Fortunately for us, even if we have
ignored the signs until we have
really a serious problem to deal
with, things can still be done about
it, no matter what our age, though
frankly, the longer we wait, the
more concentration and time it will
take to achieve the desired results.
And what can be done to a dou¬
ble chin to make the muscles firn
and smooth? They can be summed
up in one word—stimulation. As
we grow older, our circulation, that
reliable of health and beauty,
slows up. The blood, which nour
ishes the tissues, becomes less
nourishing, too. When these hap
pen, the tissues lose their firmness
and relax, the muscles sag and
drag the skin along with them, and
this is when firm contours disin¬
tegrate into double chins and bag¬
gy chins, when the wrinkled,
“crepy” throat creeps in. To re
medy these, we stimulate the cir¬
culation through the blood vessels


The “bracelet" movement to massage
the thin neck. A nourishing cream or
oil should be applied on the neck bu¬
fore the massage is done, to lubricate
the skin.
in the sagging muscles so that the
tissues are nourished and the
muscles become firm again.
Beauty specialists recommend
the use of such preparations as
skin foods and nourishing creams
for the treatment of neck and chin
troubles. Although these prepara¬
tions do wonders in softening and
lubricating the skin, they can’t
nourish the tissues. Hence, their
application should be accompanied
by stimulation, done either by pat-
ting or by manipulation.
If you are a lady of ayoirdupois,
your problem is probably a plump¬
isn chin with a tendency towards
a perhaps fully developed second
one below. For you, vigorous pat¬
ting to stimulate the blood is the
stuff. The patting may be done


with the back of the hands, as
shown in an illustration on this
page. Pat the surface under the
chin, vigorously and rapidly, until
the whole jaw-bone is pink. Then
use astringent on this surface in
order to make the muscles firm.
If you are thin but have a dou¬
ble chin, this defect may be due to
poor posture and neglect or to
abrupt reducing. In this case, the
remedy lies in using a nourishing
oil (heated, to penetrate more
deeply) or a rich tissue cream and
stimulation by means of manipula¬
tion. Spread the oil or the cream
liberally over the neck and under
part of the chin, then manipulate
the throat with the so-called brace¬
let movement: Holding the fingers
of the right hand together, place
the thumb of the hand at the top
of the throat at the right or below
the right ear lobe while the fingers
extend to the left. Do the same
with the left hand, placing the
thumb under the left ear lobe and
the fingers, below the fingers of
the right hand, extending to the
right, as shown in another of the il-
lustrations on this page. With the
hands in this position, you stroke
your neck up gently and slightly to

Below are seno
exercises suggested to help correct
or ward off a double chin:
1. Always observe a good pos¬
ture, especially when reading,
writing or sewing. Hold your
head high and lift up your chin.
2. Do not read in bed. Do not
use a high pillow under your head.
It is more desirable not to use one.
3. Sit on a straight-backed
chair, with your back against the
back of the chair. Throw your
head backward until it hangs over
the top of the back of the chair.
Or, lie down across a narrow bed
with your head dangling down one
side of the bed. With the head in
this dangling position, lift it (with-
out using your shoulders) and bend
it forward and down until your
chin touches your breast. Repeat
several times or until tired,
4. Here is a good one for a
double chin: Throw your head
backward, then whistle or if you
don’t know how, merely purse your
lips and try to blow off an imagin¬
ary feather on your upper lip.
5. This is an easy one: While
you are fixing up your hair or put¬
ting on your dress in the morning,
move your head from left to right
and then from right to left sev¬
eral times, trying to make your

San Juan del Monte, Rizal, the oth-
er Monday morning gave her 2-
month-old baby a dose of the poi¬
sonous solution. The two liquids
having almost the same color, the
mother never learned of her mis¬
take until the baby started crying
and coughing. She rushed the ba¬
by to the St. Joseph’s Hospital
where little hope for its recovery
was held by the physicians.

confesses, she still wants to have
more. She is interested in all
sorts of outdoor games, and hen
hobbies are writing to pen-pals,

She is a high school graduate,
with ambitions to become a
writer. She is fond of music,
reading, writing, and swimming.
She promises to exchange snap-

who is a lonely and broken¬

lands. She is fond of reading ro¬
mantic novels and detective sto¬
ries. Is willing to exchange snap¬
shots and promises to answer all
correspondents.
TRINIDAD BELLOSILLO,
who is a high school graduate
and a Roman Catholic, wishes to
get in touch with persons whose
ages range from fifteen to twen¬
ty years, in the Philippines and
abroad. She measures one hun¬
dred and fifty-five centimeters
and is fond of reading short sto¬
ries, playing on the ukulele, and
riding on the bicycle. Promises
to answer all letters readily. Ad¬
dress: Panay, Capiz.
MARIA MENDOZA of 36,
Brixton Hill, Santa Mesa, Mani¬

te'ligent, can develop a wife’s mind.
The trouble with most wives, he
says, is that they read only the so¬
ciety pages and are interested only
in the dresses of their women
friends.
Although the majority of hus¬
bands whom we interviewed told us,
rather bravely we think, that they
have nothing to complain about,
that they are satisfied with the
way things are in their respective
homes, we seemed to be conscious
all the time each talked with us, of
an undercurrent of regret or of dis¬
appointment (in the case of the
older husbands) and of dissatisfac-
tion (in the case of the younger
ones) which may be attributed to
some sad experiences for which they
secretly blame their wives. In the
course of each interview, we learned
of some unhappy incident, men¬
tioned casually, but giving us an
insight into his married life. For
instance, we learned that three of
the husbands we interviewed lost a
child each because of premature
births. One lost his baby before it
was one year old. Another has a
son in spite of whose invalidism
the mother continues to work, leav¬
ing him alone with his nurse. An¬
other husband started telling us,
we thought at first with pride, of a
beautiful house that his wife has
built with her earnings and ended
his story with the statement that it
is a glorified dormitory for they
just sleep in it. We were told of a
story of a man who after the death
of his wife, who was one of the
working women, said that he would
choose merely a high school grad-
uate for his next wife, and he did.

ALUINI CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARY OF ALMA MATER


In connection with the 30th anniversary of the Central Philippine College, Jaro, Iloilo, the Manila chapter,
C.P.C. Alumni Association, held a banquet at the Plaza Hotel last January 25th. At the presidential table, uppe
photo, left to right: Mr. Fernandez, Ren. Arquieza, Mr. M. Mosqueda, president of the association, Dr. D.
Hibbard, guest af honor; Mr. Abe S. Gonzales, adviser of the association and editor of the HILIGAYNON: Pro
M. Gamboa of U. P., and Mr. S. Lopez. Below: a view of the banquet.


All husbands agree that marriage
nd a career may be combined suc¬
essfully, but it takes an intelli¬
gent woman who knows how to bud¬
ret her time to do it. Most of them
agree also that the best arrange¬
ment that a woman can make is to
give up her work temporarily, have
the desired number of children, and
then go back to work when the chil¬-
dren reach school age. In the mean¬
time, she should keep informed
about her vocation or profession so
that she will be ready to resume it
if she desires. The trouble, however,
with most working women, one
husband said, is that they become
so ambitious that they are not will¬
ing to give up their work even
when the welfare of their families
or their own health demands it.
They consider their careers of
primary importance, when by nature
of their sex, the careers should be
secondary to marriage and mother¬
hood. Women, he says, whose
careers are of first importance to
them should not marry.
In spite of the many advantages
that a husband may claim he and
his wife get when both are earn¬
ing and are away from home most
of the time, these advantages, the
older men say, weigh lightly in the
balance when the hazards to the
well-being, physically and morally,
are considered.
The husband of a woman who
may be considered one of the pio¬
neers among Filipino working
women, said that had he known
that the result of his wife’s going
out to work would be ill health in
her declining years, he would nev¬
er have consented to it. For a wom¬
an, because of her physical make¬
up, cannot shoulder two burdens at
the same time: bearing and rear¬
ing children and working, without


that children who had been brought
up by persons other than their re¬
spective mothers turned out to be
undesirable citizens. Fortunately
for his children, their mother is
such a capable woman that she has
never neglected them nor their
home because of work. In fact,
whenever any occasion arises when
she has to make a choice between the
welfare of her family and her work,
she has never hesitated to choose
the first. However, when it comes
to choosing between her own health
or convenience and loyalty to those
whom she serves, she chooses the
latter.

To the charge that society girls
do nothing for others less lucky,
the Misses Margarita Araneta and
Pilar Campos, who also move in high
society, furnish a rebuttal. These
young ladies, together with well¬
known ones like the Misses Lour¬
des and Mary de Veyra, Adeling
Carrera, Alicia Jose, go to differ¬
ent city elementary schools and
teach catechism and religion, at
least once a week.
Such instruction, given by cul¬
tured and talented girls, is purely
voluntary. Bred in the best home
atmosphere, they have schooled
themselves to the temporary depri¬
vation of comforts to which they
are accustomed, and patiently allow
themselves the sacrifice of several

healthy in her 'teens. Si never
got sick and was always acve. But
when she got the idea of ducing
in order to have a slender bly, she
became thin, sickly, and pa She
even failed in her studies scause
of ill health. How can she egain
her lost vitality? What shoil she

ANSWERS:—The present lysi¬
cal condition of your sister sems
to be very poor. And if she on¬
tinues to be so, she is liable teac¬
quire any disease if not tube u¬
losis. Her failure in the exaui¬
nation may be due to poor heah.
Students need plenty of nutrit e
foods because of mental and pl-
sical overwork. So, there is n
reason why your sister shou
reduce her meals. It will be got
for her to take off from her min
the idea of "slendering" until sh
acquires good health. Tell yoma

year-old son suffers from colds
with slight coughing almost
throughout the year. He always
comp'ains of labored breathing. I
consulted a physician in the local¬
ity and I was informed that he has
adenoids. What caused him to have

A SERVICE OF LOVE

o’clock. Art is an engaging mis¬
tress. It was more times 7 o’clock
when he returned in the evening.
At the end of the week Delia,
sweetly proud but languid, trium¬
phantly tossed three five-dollar
bills on the 8 x 10 (inches) centre
table of the 8 x 10 (feet) flat par¬
lor.
“Sometimes,” she said a little
wearily, “Clementina tries on. I’m
afraid she doesn’t practise enough
and I have to tell her the same
things so often. And then she al¬
ways dresses entirely in white, and
that does get monotonous. But
Gen. Pinkney is the dearest old
man! I wish you could know him,
Joe. He comes in sometimes when
I am with Clementina at the piano
—he is a widower, you know—and
stands there pulling his white goa¬
tee. "'And how are the semiquavers
and the demisemiquavers progres¬
sing?’ he always asks.
“I wish you could see the wain¬
scoting in that drawing-room, Joe!
And those Astrakhan rug portieres.
And Clementina has such a funny
little cough. I hope she is stron¬
ger than she looks. Oh, I really am
getting attached to her, she is so¬
gentle and high bred. Gen. Pink-
ney’s brother was once Minister to
Bolivia."
And then Joe, with the air of a
Monte Cristo, drew forth a ten, a
five, a two and a one—all legal ten¬
der notes—and laid them beside
Delia’s earnings.
“Sold that water color of the obe¬
lisk to a man from Peoria," he an¬
nounced, overwhelmingly.
“Don’t joke with me,” said De¬
lia—"not from Peoria!"
“All the way. I wish you could
see him, Dele. Fat man with a
woolen muffler and a quill tooth-
pick. He saw the sketch in Tinkle’s
window and thought it was a wind¬
mill at first. He was game, though,
and bought it anyhow. He ordered
another—an oil sketch of the Lack-
awanna freight depot—to take back
with him. Music lessons! Oh, I
guess Art is still in it."
“I'm so glad you’ve kept on," said
Delia, heartily. “You’re bound to
win, dear. Thirty-three dollars!
We never had so much to spend be¬
fore. We’ll have oysters to-night."
“And fillet mignon with cham¬
pignons," said Joe. “Where is the
olive fork?”
On the next Saturday evening
Joe reached home first. He spread
his $18 on the parlor table and
washed what seemed to be a great
deal of dark paint from his hands.
Half an hour later Delia arrived,
her right hand tied up in a shape¬
less bundle of wraps and bandages.
“How is this?” asked Joe after
the usual greetings. Delia laughed,
but not very joyously.
“Clementina," she exclaimed, "in¬
sisted upon a Welsh rabbit after her
lesson. She is such a queer girl.
Welsh rabbits at 5 in the afternoon.
The General was there. You should
have seen him run for the chafing
dish, Joe, just as if there wasn’t a


servant in the house. I know Cle¬
mentina isn’t in good health; she is
so nervous. In serving the rabbit
she spilled a great lot of it, boiling
hot, over my hand and wrist. It
hurt awfully, Joe. And the dear
girl was so sorry! But Gen. Pink¬
ney!—Joe, that old man nearly
went distracted. He rushed down¬
stairs and sent somebody—they
said the furnace man or somebody
in the basement—out to a drug
store for some oil and things to
bind it up with. It doesn’t hurt so
much now.”
“What’s this?” asked Joe, taking
the hand tenderly and pulling at
some white strands beneath the
bandages.
“It’s something soft," said Delia,
“that had oil on it. Oh, Joe, did
you sell another sketch?” she had
seen the money on the table.
"Did I?” said Joe; “just ask the
man from Peoria. He got his de¬
pot to-day, and he isn’t sure but he
thinks he wants another parkscape
and a view on the Hudson. What
time this afternoon did you burn
your hand, Dele?”
"Five o’clock, I think,” said Dele,
plaintively. “The iron—I mean the
rabbit came off the fire about that
time. You ought to have seen Gen.
Pinkney, Joe, when¬
“Sit down here a moment, Dele,"
said Joe. He drew her to the couch,
sat beside her and put his arm
across her shoulders.
“What have you been doing for
the last two weeks, Dele?” he
asked.
She braved it for a moment
or two with an eye full of love and
stubbornness, and murmured a
phrase or two vaguely of Gen.
Pinkney; but at length down went
her head and out came the truth
and tears.
“I couldn’t get any pupils,” she
confessed. "And I couldn’t bear to
have you give up your lessons; and
I got a place ironing shirts in that
big Twenty-fourth Street laundry.
And I think I did very well to make
up both General Pinkney and Cle¬
mentina, don’t you, Joe? And when
a girl in the laundry set down a hot
iron on my hand this afternoon I
was all the way home making up
that story about the Welsh rabbit.
You’re not angry, are you, Joe?
And if I hadn’t got the work you
mightn’t have sold your sketches to
that man from Peoria."
“He wasn’t from Peoria," said
Joe, slowly.
“Well, it doesn’t matter where he
was from. How clever you are, Joe
—and—kiss me, Joe—and what
made you ever suspect that I wasn’t
giving music lessons to Clementi¬
na?'
“I didn’t,” said Joe, "until to¬
night. And I wouldn’t have then,
only I sent up this cotton waste and
oil from the engine-room this af-
ternoon for a girl upstairs who
had her hand burned with a
smoothing-iron. I’ve been firing
the engine in that laundry for the
last two weeks.”

QUESTION S:—A, a chief
of police, was accused administra¬
tively for neglecting his duty on
July 24, 1933, and was sus¬
pended from office. On August 4,
1933, A was tried before the mu¬
nicipal council and was found guil¬
ty. On August 10, 1933, he was
discharged from duty. A appealed
to the provincial board and was
tried on September 15, 1933, but
the decision is not yet knowr
to this time. What should A do
he was not reinstated after a sus
pension of 30 days? If the provin
cial board found out that A is not
guilty, can A claim his salary dur¬
ing his suspension? Can his sala¬
ry be withheld during his suspen¬
sion even though he is exonerated?
Can the municipal council discharge
A from office though not found
guilty? In case there is a deadlock
in the decision of the members of
the provincial board, na¬


sho ld be taken to settle the mat¬
ter?—Amado Arceo, Pulupandan,
OccAANegros.
ANSWERS:—A must ipso facto
be reinstated after a suspension
of 30 days and if he is not, he can
file a Vetition to that effect. But
the me, fact that he was exonera¬
ted of ne charges by the provin¬
cial boald does not entitle him to
ask for the salary during his sus¬
pension. Neither the provincial
board nor the municipal council
can discharge a municipal police
from off ce without just cause,
and in case the provincial board
cannot and does not decide his
case on account of the deadlock,
his remedy is to take the matter to
the attention of the secretary of
the interior.—Answered by Atty.

Training In Application
By DEMETRIO AGUINALDO
Principal, Aparri (Cagayan) Elementary School


WINNERS IN DEBATE


The Misamis High School debating team which won the
Bukidnon-Misamis debate held in Cagayan, Oriental Misamis, in
connection with the Northern Mindanao athletic meet last month.
Seated are Carmen Marfori, captain, and Mr. Victorino J. Soria¬
no, coach. Standing, from left to right, are Valentin Chavez,
second speaker; Rebecca Royola, alternate; and Bienvenida Sil¬
vestre, third speaker.


EHE problem of training chil-
dren to apply or put into
practice the theories that
they have learned consists mainly
in creating situations that will
lead them to use their newly ac¬
quired knowledge. However, it is
not enough merely to create these
situations; the pupils must be en¬
couraged to make use of them.
Some Sources of Application
T. Constructive or Creative Ef¬
fort. When the children’s efforts
either in pre-seatwork, out-growth
seatwork, or an assigned home work
vary or are slightly different from
the model, we regard them as signs
of originality. The following pro¬
jects are designed to develop the
manipulative inborn tendencies and
originality of the children:
Requesting the children to make
drawings of specimens in element¬
ary science. This work demands
knowledge and discrimination.
Encouraging the children to ex¬
press their own ideas in drawing
and art work.
Asking the girls to mend or
patch old, worn-out clothes or to
turn out a serviceable dress out of
pieces from two or three old dresses
in their home economics class; or
al'owing the boys to make toys and
miniature objects according to their
own ideas in their class in indus¬
trial arts.
Asking pupils to make outline
maps and then to fill them in dif-
ferent ways: to show industries,
products, rainfall, or physical fea¬
tures graphically. The children can
also fill outline maps to show ex¬
plorations, settlements, changes in
territory, and military campaigns,
in their class in history.
Asking pupils to collect pictures
of fruits for a fruit chart, the
fruits classified as exported and
imported; pictures of different
kinds of animals for an animal
chart; pictures of different kinds


of foods, classified according to
food obtained by gathering, by
trapping, by planting, and by bar¬
tering. Or asking them to make a
list of plants that give materials
for clothing, materials for shelter,
and materials for food. Or to draw
pictures from riddles.
II. Reading and Speaking with
Expression. Can the children read
with expression after possessing a
fair degree of the mechanics of
reading? If not, train them to ex¬
press themselves with the use of
oral reading device, asking them to
read sentences or paragraphs in ac¬
cordance with the feeling that the
author wants to convey, as for ex¬
ample:
Happiness: “Hurrah! Tomor¬
row is a vacation day.”
Anger: “Traitor! Why then did
you make a signal?'
Fear: “Mother! Mother! The
policeman is after us.
Command: “Romans, countrymen,
and lovers, bear me for my cause
and be silent that you may hear."
The children may put into prac¬
tice reading or speaking with ex¬
pression in the formal (opening
exercises, convocations, and enter¬
tainment) and informal (reading
lessons and dramatic oral reading)
dramatizations.
III. Understanding. If by chance
you find your pupils seemingly de¬
void of understanding, give them
more of organization questions that
will help them reproduce the story;
some more of the thought ques¬
tions on the lesson; some more drill
in selecting main thoughts in an¬
swer to a question; and some more
of the ideas that will help them to
understand the selection or seat
work given.
IV Dictation. Dictation is an
excellent means for training pupils
to apply the technicalities of the
written composition, such as punc-
tuation, capitalization, and penman¬


ship. In every dictation lesson, it
is necessary that each selection

technicalities of language. One

it shows how to write a friendly

rates the use of the apostrophe in
contraction and in possession; and
still another because it illustrates

Technique in Training Pupils in
Application
1. Motivation: The first step is
to lead the pupils to desire to do
the things that the teacher wants
them to do.
2. Statement of the problem or
task: The next step is to have the
pupils know just what the task is.
Children must be guided by an ana¬
lysis of a few specific instances
about the problem before they are
given the assignment to be worked
out independently.
3. Necessary Information: The
third step is to find out whether
the information given is sufficient
or has been grasped by the pupils.
If not, give them additional infor¬
mation. The greatest weakness of


our teaching is that we teachers
give out too little information be¬
fore we request our pupils to work.

Prwvat? Benches
By LUCIAY JOVELLANOS


Y N most churches, particuarly
ours, private benches hay, be¬
I come the latest vogue. I hean,
most families install their lown
benches in church with such har¬
acteristic signs as "Familia ser¬
vado" or “Private—Family e Mr.
and Mrs. So-and-So.” It di not
take long for all benches in ehurch
to be marked private with lut one
or two seats left for the puelic.
Thus when we, who were Jot able
to install any private benal, went
to church, we simply had to kneel
during the whole service, n matter
how long the sermon was or whe¬
ther Mass happened to be a pontif-
ical one. Some of the boder ones,
however, usually took idvantage
of, or made themselves comfortable
on, the private benches curing the
whole period Mass was keing said
“If they can do it, whi can’t I?”
I told myself one morninag when l
was already too tired kneeling
down. And so, making myself
bolder, I walked to one of the empty
benches and seated myself there.
But when I tried to pray I could
not. My guilt kept me disturbed
and distracted. I surreptitiously
kept looking back, for fear the own-
ers would make a sudden appear¬
ance. And if they saw me there.!
I remembered some owners who


scolded those who sat on their
benches or coldly told them to
please get out of their private pro¬
perty. But, luckily, the owners of
the bench I was on did not hear
Mass that day.
Feeling it all, I persuaded my
father to install a private bench for
our use in church. And father,
after a time, put one. But it did
not help matters any, I came to
learn afterwards¬
For, although we now have a
bench of our own, we still have to
do the kneeling during the whole
Mass. When we go to church we
always find our bench filled to
capacity; and we simply haven’t
the nerve to ask them to please al¬
low us some seating space. I re¬
member, we managed to sit on it
ence, although the bench was rather
crowded. But an old woman, a
stranger to us, asked my sister to
please find another seat because we
were so crowded already. Can you
beat that?

MANILA
The educational excursion to Los
Banos held by the members of the
Builders' Club of the Philippine
School of Arts and Trades turned
out successful through the efforts
and brotherly cooperation of the
active club officers and Mr. Ati¬
lano F. Montesa, technical adviser
of the organization. The officers
headed the party of ambitious
would-be builders while the adviser
was sole guide. Picture taking, vis¬
iting laboratories in the various de¬


FHIS is being written ir Ba¬
guio, and the wonder of t is
 that it is being writte at
all. People say that the soil of
climate they have out here m es
one think better, and it is true, y
dears, it is true. That’s just e
trouble: you find thinking so e: n
comfortable, delightful, that ,u
tend to confine yourself to it! All
to that the fact that I have suel a
plausible excuse for loafing and y a
will understand why, despite a’l tty
leisure now at my disposal, I haos
done nothing about that great Fik¬
pino novel and those three-act plars
which I have been threatening t
write all these years. Indeed, eve
this column is proving to be no pie
In the words of another writer
who is staying out here, Dr. Ma¬
nuel de Veyra (whom you may re¬
member as a winner in a fea¬
ture article contest conducted by
  some years ago): "What
a place Baguio is for storing up
inertia!” And of Fred Maxey, local
DMHM man: “Here, one is prone
not only to 'vacate’ but to vege¬
tate!”
I LEFT for this place on rather
short notice but despite that, quite
a number of my friends were able
to say “So long!”: Federico Manga¬
has, B. M., Guillermo Castillo, and
five of the Bachelorettes. Of the
remaining three B’s, two had been
apprised that Manila must get
along w'thout me . for some time,
and one was on the high seas, re¬
turning from the Visayan bailiwick
in which she had spent Yuletide
after a strenuous half-year in anc
with the U. P. and its accessories.
(B.M., of course, stands for Ba¬
che'orette Muse and not Bowel
Movement, you nasty man, you!)
ALWAYS the thoughtful friend,
F.M. brought a book, Clarence
Day’s “This Simian World," and a
magazine, Column Review, for me
to read on the train.
From the Column Review your
columnist—who is not startlingly
up-to-date in many things—learned


that television has been perfected.
And the wicked thought flashed in
his mind that now, we needn’t rely
on the comic sections to brighten
life with funny faces!
IN ONE chapter of the Clarence
Day effusion, which is a gravely
humorous little book, I read of how
a certain doctor’s experiments led
him to conclude that while a mon-
key’s passion is constantly aflame,
it is not burned at invariably the
same shrine.
Now, I cannot pretend to speak
for the queens of creation. But I
do believe that the lords thereof
have a similar tendency of poly-
gamy. In truth, only a week or so
before I was requested to rest for
a while, I started a p’ay which had
—or should I say, will have—to do
with eight girls desirous of know-
ing what it is that every man
wants. They are ideally equipped
for the investigation, as one is de¬
cidedly beautiful, another undoubt-
edly brilliant, the third distinctly
of the c'inging vine type, the fourth
thoroughly a modern maiden, and
so on. The curtain falls on their
discovery—made in a way which
will, I flatter myself, prove some¬
hing of a surprise, but which na¬
urally should not be detailed here
—that what every man wants is a
hirem.
Does it sound un-Christian? Let
m: assure you that it isn’t. For as
thit model Christian, Chesterton,
ponted out once, any man can have
a prem by marrying just one wo¬
ma.. If you doubt that, read or re¬
call Barrie’s “Seven Women," which
was reprinted in   'way

WONDERS OF THE PHILIPPINES-B, Recie


The Legislative Building
E HE legislative building symbolizes
the power of the people in this
country. This imposing structure,
costing millions of pesos of the citi¬
zens' money, is rightly called the
“palace of the people."
No modern structure in the city has
been the scene of more transcending
events than the legislative building.
Here it was where the last bicameral


legislature held its deliberations and
had its offices. Here it was where
the new “Magna Charta” of the people
was framed by the best minds of the
country. It was this building which
served as the background for the im¬
pressive inaugural ceremonies. Now,
it houses the session hall and the of¬
fices of the National Assembly. It
also shelters the Philippine National
Library.
The legislative building has four
floors and a mezzanine floor. It has


two inner courts. The land occupied
by the building has an area of 6,664
square meters, and the building was
built at a total cost of P4,075,000.
The original plans of the building
were drawn by Mr. Ralph Harrington
Doane, former consulting architect of
the bureau of public works. Mr.
Doane’s plans, which called for a
three-story building to house the
Philippine National Library and Mu¬
seum, were later altered and ampli¬
fled by Mr. Arellano, architect of the


bureau of public works, following the
voting of larger appropriation fo
the construction of a larger buildin
which would house not only the libra
ry but the session halls and the of
fices of the legislature as well.
The construction was begun i
1919 by Gordon & Hayle. In 1924
Arevalo & Siochi took up the work
On July 16, 1926, the country’s law
making body met for the first tim
in the "new palace of the people.”

had began chewing it when sudden-
ly he stopped moving his jaws. For
a few seconds his mouth remained
partly opened and motionless, while
he stared hard at Anita’s mother.
Then he brought the fork down with
a clatter on his saucer and furious¬
ly chewed the food in his mouth.
Anita’s mother turned her head
to the bespectacled man, and then
she called Anita. "Here—you feed
your father. Im going to get the
glasses of water.”
“Just a moment,” Anita said to
me, leaving her saucer of rice cakes
on the window sill, and I said, "It’s
all right. Don’t mind me."
Anita took the fork and the sau¬
cer which her mother left on the ta¬
ble and began to feed her father.


She looked at his thin uncropped
grey hair tenderly, and the old man
silently took in his mouth the pieces
of cake from the fork in Anita’s
hand, while the bespectacled man
sat gravely in his chair, the saucer
and fork on his lap. The bespecta¬
cled man was no longer eating.
Soon Anita’s mother came in
with the glasses of water. I was
then putting down my saucer on
the window sill beside Anita’s and
when the mother saw me, she said,
Are you through?”
“Yes,” I said, and she walked to¬
wards me with the glasses, and I
stood up. I drank my water stand¬
ing and Anita’s mother stood be¬
side me, waiting for the empty
glass. When I was through, I placed
the empty glass alongside the full
ones on the tin platter which sha


held and said, “Thank you.” She
smiled and I saw how like Anita’s
were her eyes, and when she moved
away toward the bespectacled man
I saw Anita’s father looking at me
while Anita held the fork of rice
cake near his mouth. He must have
followed Anita’s mother with his
gaze when she came in with the
glasses of water, because after
smiling faintly to acknowledge my
smile, Anita’s father again followed
his wife with his gaze.
For a while the old man looked
on as Anita’s mother handed a glass
of water to the bespectacled man
and I saw the jaws of Anita’s father
set quiveringly ageinst each other
Then he withdrei his gaze, slowly
turned his head, and his face be¬
came expressionless and pallid.
“Herc father,” Anit said, hold¬


ing another piece of rice cake neal
his mouth. But the old man did not
open his mouth.  owly he raisec
his right hand and 1 saw how the
rigid fingers, rigid in their joints
straight and apart from each othel
at the tips, trembled and quivered.
Up, up, slowly, the hand went, anc
then tremblingly pushed Anita’s
hand away
"Why?
Don’t you like any
more,” Anita said gently. “Come
on, just this piece."
But the old man did not answer.
Slowly, quiveringly he lowered his
rigid-fingered hand on his lap and
stared blankly at the unfinished
carving on the table. Then his lips
began to move in a wordless whis¬
per.
Anita’s mother had gone out

hours a week teaching Christian
virtues to the children of the for¬
gotten men.
“Some people are simply misin¬
formed!" so said Bertito Zamora,
Bachelors’ playboy, now engaged
seriously in making motions for
new trials, demurrers, pleas in con¬
fession and avoidance, and to
thumbing legal tomes.
“If we hold an affair, do you
think there will be any money left
from the appropriation for it?
None. Society balls, you see, are
not like those conducted by colleges
and schools where they frequently
charge persons attending such af¬
fairs. We don’t. It would be bad
taste if we send our guests cards
marked five pesos each!
“We don’t do that,” he added.
“We charge only the members of
the club, and the managers answer
for the deficits. How much are the
deficits? Why, they don’t go below
P300; they sometimes reach P1,000.
That’s why, if we give a ball, don’t
expect that a part of the money can
be taken out for charity.
"Nevertheless, we do lots for
charity too. Remember that ty-
phoon of 1933, when thousands of
people lost their homes? Well, the
Kahirup held its anniversary ball
in November of that year, and
placed a collection box at the door.
You should have heard the rustle
of bills going inside the box. Then

people put on a stage show. That
was for charity, too. To whom
were the proceeds distributed?
Well, let me see. No, I don’t re¬
member now.
Attorney Zamora added that a
society ball is not a subscription
dance. In the latter, young men
are charged an admission price;
but that would seem making the
girls taxi dancers. Hence, society
never does that. Besides, a sub¬
scription dance is a racket; and
the proceeds are pocketed by the
managers.
Professor Maria Lanzar-Carpio,
of the University of the Philip-
pines, however, strikes a different
note.
“If they can afford to spend a
lot for their own pleasure,” the
woman professor said, "why, leave
them alone. That is their own busi¬
ness; it is not for us to tell them
to lessen their social functions be¬
cause the other half of the world
is not feeling well. For all we know,
these very same people are spend¬
ing a lot too for charity, for help¬
ing improve the lot of the less for¬
tunate ones.
“But there is one thing rich peo¬
ple should really do," she said by
way of suggestion. “That is phi¬
lanthropy. We have, as yet, so ve¬
ry few scholarships for deserving
people. We don’t have plenty of
donations to educational institu¬
tions, as they have in the countries
of the western hemisphere. Per
haps that is what we should do: en¬


couraging our people to be more
generous, instead of criticizing
and making an effort to curtail
their social pursuits."

HIGH COMMISSIONER
The Adams bill in Congress,
which is intended to block the pay-
ment to the Philippines of around
P47,000,000 from the U. S. treasury
(see under “Foreign Affairs," page
53), was most probably discussed
by High Commissioner Murphy and
President Quezon when the latter
called at the Mansion House last
Saturday afternoon. The two had
previously announced their inten¬
tion of forestalling the passage of
the bill.
*
MALACANANG
The million-peso colonization plan
made a stride after standing still
for some time, when President
Quezon the other Tuesday issued
two proclamations declaring land
rese vations for colonization in
M danao: 4,650 hectares in Ta¬
Davao; 4,280 in Tubunan, La¬
no. Part of the money appro¬
priated for the colonization plan
will be reverted to the construction
of roads to these colonization a¬
to make settlement easy.

BUREAUS
Because they are under contract
as government experts, Dirs. Luther
B. Bewley of the bureau of edu¬
cation and Arthur Fischer of the
bureau of forestry and Dr. Augus¬
tus P. West, bureau of science
chemist, will be retained in the
service for at least 1 year more, it
was learned the other Wednesday
afternoon when these three men’s
contracts were renewed by Pres.
Quezon. Dir. Bewley and Dir.
Fischer have been in government
service here for over 30 years.
JUDICIARY
“Riot and Run” Pedro Ocampo,
who featured in the September
(1934) La Minerva rioting, was
convicted of sedition by the supreme
court the other Monday and was
given a prison term of 6 years, 8
months, and 1 day, besides being

MPULSIVE, action thirsty
President Quezon last week
Aswiveled his guns from the
field of oil scandals and trained
them in the direction of jueteng¬
ridden Manila and the surround-
ing provinces, particularly Lagu¬
na, Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan.
To make his anti-vice drive more
concrete than mere announcements,
he issued circulars to all provincial
governors and commanders (the
president wouldn’t take chances of
missing some innocent-looking pro¬
vinces) last Tuesday, warning them
to suppress vice in their respective
provinces, or else—
The Damocletian “or else" should
frighten all provincial governors
and commanders. A few days be¬
fore His Excellency issued those
orders, he had considered dismis¬
sing all provincial chief executives
and P. C. commanders who could
not (or would not) enforce the laws
against vice of all forms, especial¬
ly jueteng.
Somebody perhaps timidly com¬
mented that it was not exactly
within the President’s power to ef¬
fect so drastic an action. So the
President upped and said if he did


from P200 to P500 each.
ACCIDENTS
An explosion the other Tuesday
afternoon resulting from the short
circuiting of a storage battery in
the S-40, a USS submarine being
drydocked at the Cavite Navy Yard,
resulted in the death of Librado de
Castro and the injury of 7 others.
The blast hurled the victims and
were too stunned to crawl away
from the fire which immediately
followed, but were saved by marin¬
ers who rushed to the rescue.

A small baby, while awaiting
baptism in the Silang (Cavite) Ca¬

not have that power, then he would
request (?) the National Assembly
to give him that. He would also
beg of the body to throw into the
bargain an amendment of the gam¬
bling laws such that jueteng main¬
tainers would be given a stiff im-
prisonment sentence, not the ridic-
ulously insignificant fine which
they could hand over without bat-

the appointments until he could se¬

each of the possible choices.

ELIGIBILITY RULES
CLARIFIED
To clarify the provisions of the
civil service eligibility executive
order made by President Quezon
early last month, the bureau of civ-
il service last week gave out the
memorandum below:
(1) The executive order of the President
refers only to positions already in the civil
service. For appointment to municipal posi¬
tions, except in the cilies of Manila and Ba¬
guio, the giving of competitive examinations
is not mandatory until a law is passed by
the National Assembly placing the mun¬
icipalities in the civil service. In view nf
this fact, no definite arrangements hava been
made regardng examinations for municipal
employees including municipal teachers
(2) Teachers holding regular and per¬
manent (provincial or insular) positions, hut
with no examination status, will retain their
status as regular and permanent employees at
th ir present salaries, but they are not elig.
ible for further promotion antil they shall
have qualified in appropriate compe itive ex¬
aminations. Whether or not this rule will
also apply to teachers holding regular and
permanent (municipal) appointments, with no
examination status, will he decided when the
constitutional provision relative to the exten¬
sion of the merit system to all branches and
suhdivisions of the government is made
operative by the enactment of the necessary
supplementary legislation.
(3) Should such a law be enacted, mun¬
icipal teachers who have been in the service
continuously since they passed the junior
teachers (regular or promotional) examinat on
or within the period of eligibility of the
examination, would not lose their eligibility
for appointment in the civil service.
(4) Graduates of the Philippine Normal
School, the Philippine Schools of Arts ant
Trades, the Philippine General Hospital
School of Nursing, the Southern Islands Hos-
pital School of Nursing, the School of
Forestry of the University of the Philippines,
and telegraph operators, postmaster-ope¬
rators and radio operators of the bur-au of
posts, who have be n given regular and per¬
manent appointments prior to November 15,
1935, may ramain in the service as perma¬
nent employees. They are not, however,
eligible for promotion until they shall have
qual fied in appropriate civil service examina¬
tions.
5) Employees in the insular and prov¬
incial service as well as in the cities of Ma¬
nila and Baguio who are ragularly and per¬
manently appointed to positions in the clas¬
sified service by virtue of civil service
elig'bility are not affected by the executive
order of the President.


gathered at the Manila Grand Ope¬
ra House last Sunday morning. He
said America is strong enough to
defend us from any foreign inva¬
sion and internal peace can be
maintained without increasing the
present constabulary force.


Aguinaldo: believes army is a waste of
meney and effort.


“I sincerely believe,” the general
added, “that for the good of the
people and the government of this
country, the money which is to be
invested in the Philippine army...
should be employed in the promo¬
tion of industries."
He also hoped that the present
administration would reduce the fat
salaries of officials by one-half
and would revise the salary scheme
on the basis of Japan’s
High government officials scor¬
ed the Aguinaldo speech, said the
veteran could do more for the coun-
try by renouncing his monthly
₱1,000 pension and giving it to the
poor.

constabulary agents right on Ave¬

intelligence division men probably
vowed not to let the same thing

But history was repeated when
Justice of the Peace Carlos Lanuza

Agent Cornelio Dungao the slip in
Caloocan that same night while on
their way to Manila.
In Caloocan, Lanuza begged to be
permitted to go into the house of his
father (who resides in that town)
so he could put on something more
decent. Not suspecting anything,

FILIPINO EDUCATOR GIVEN RARE HONOR IN U. S.
TI is very rare that a Filipino is

to Dr. Pedro T. Orata, instructor in
education at the Ohio State Univer-

The Who is Who in American

him as a member of several na¬

to many educational publications in
the U.S.

WANTS MORE TEETH ON GAMBLING LAW


—) OTH jueteng collectors and
 maintainers will have plenty
to worry about when the Alcid rec-
ommendations seeking to put more
barbs on the existing gambling
laws of the city is approved by the
municipal board.
For instance, Asst. Chief Alcid
would clap a I-month imprisonment
and a P100-fine on jueteng collec¬
tors convicted for the first time.
Under the existing city laws, first
offenders are given only light fines.
While the fine remains the same
for second offenders, the length of
imprisonment is stretched to 3
months. In the third and succeeding
convictions, the imprisonment is
further lengthened to 6 months
and the fine increased to P200.
The proposed amendment would
jolt jueteng maintainers, convicted
for the first time, with a fine of
₱100 and an imprisonment of 3
months. In the third and succeeding
convictions, 6 months imprisonment
and a fine of P200.


The majority in the municipal
board are, according to President

Alcid recommendations.

who had been charged by two wi¬

The assemblyman declared that
the claims he sold really existed,
and were not mere water stocks; he
presented documentary evidence and
maps to substantiate this. He fur-
ther added that he never sought the
two widows to sell the claims, the
transaction being effected through
the mediation of a nephew of one 
the ladies.
The widows, according to the
semblyman, failed to pay the taxes
due the mining claims they bought,
and so these were withdrawn by the
government but were again re-lo¬
cated by him and are now in his
possession. He said he increased
the price of the claims in the receipt

New Jersey Gov. Hoffman, con¬

England
With millions of loyal subjects
milling in the streets of London
during the funeral procession of the
late King George V last January
28th, over 7,000 people were hurt
and 1 was dead from the pressure


exerted by the crowd. The funeral

minutes late because of the crowd.
The remains of the king were low¬

Japan, darling of calamities, lost
23 of her population last January
27th, when a snowslide engulfed a

The giant mass of snow slid down

three coaches over a cliff. Sixty-


three other passengers were in¬

Charged with conspiring with

ported that the five men received
their orders from "a foreign mili¬

was interpreted as meaning Japan.

up. He looked at his timepiece and
fidgeted restlessly. And when Ani¬
ta’s mother came in he told her to
hurry up. “The train leaves at
eleven-ten, he said. “We might be
late.
“Why?” Anita said. "Are you
leaving again?
Nobody answered her. The be¬
spectacled man remained standing
and the mother went to the trunk
where the reed box was. She opened
the reed box and I saw earrings and
rings and necklaces and other trin¬
kets stuck on pieces of white card¬
board. She took a leather wallet
from among the cardboards stuck
with trinkets and from the leather
wallet she took a one-peso bill. She
placed the one-peso bill on the
trunk, folded the leather wallet and
placed it back in the reed box. Then
she said, "Here," pointing at the
one-peso bill on the trunk, “there is
still plenty of rice in the rice jar.
This will be for viands.” She moved
away while Anita and I looked on.
The old man continued moving his

Then Anita’s mother said, "Let’s

moved doorward. He went down

she said loudly, "We’ll not be back

For a while Anita did not move.
She remained looking at her father
until the footsteps of those who de¬

she left her father and closed the
door quietly, saying, “That’s her
partner--her business partner.

After a month of training here,
the ath etes will be ready to sail for

We might spring a surprise in

I IS MEDICAL SERVICE IN THE.
Continued from page 11


times have to cross streams or
travel through rough highways.
I know of a man in the province
who was too poor to pay for med¬
ical attention. One day, he came
to the doctor and paid him his med¬
ical bils. The doctor was naturally
surprised and inquired where he
obtained his money. When the man
confessed that he had to sell his
carabao, the doctor immediately
told him to go home and buy his
carabao back. He did.
I am recalling this incident for
no reason other than to show that
medical treatment is really not a
great burden for the common tao.
Hundreds of incidents like this
happen, and hundreds of patients
enter and leave the clinics of our
physicians without being required
to pay anything if they are not in
a position to do so. The public sel¬
dom hears of these things, but it
is because doctors do not blow
their our own horns.
Physicians treat their patients
without regard to the capacity of
the patients to pay. As far as I
know, any poor patient can go to
any practising physician and get
himself treated free, if only he tells
hs doctor the truth. There is no
worthy doctor that I know of who
will refuse to treat a patient just
because that patient cannot afford
to pay for treatment. If he can¬
not do it himself he usually can and
does arrange for his patients with
establishment institutions.
Medicine in general is not ex¬
pensive in the Philippines. I know
of hundreds of cases where patients
were given services by doctors
where a small fee was paid, whereas
those same services would cost
hundreds of pesos in other coun¬
tries.
For this reason, can it be truly


said medicine is expensive for the
tao in the Philippines?
This is a subject a doctor does
not like to discuss in public, for
fear of being misunderstood. I can
only hope that the public will make
more of an effort to understand and
give more support to what the doc¬
tors are trying to do for their com¬
munities throughout the Common¬
wealth.


"No, it is not,” said Dr. Catalino
Boncan, for many years first vice
president of the Philippine Islands
Medical Association. Well-to-do
families here have their own fa¬
mily physicians. They pay higher
fees because the physicians they re¬
tain are specialists. Surgeons and
specialists charge high rates, it is
true. But in the long run, the pa¬
tients who go to specialists ac¬
tually pay less as they are assured
of the best medical attention and
because they get cured quickly. Com-
pared with rates in other countries,
medicine is not at all expensive in
the Philippines.
The same opinion is voiced by
Narciso Villegas, who is connected
with the Asiatic Petroleum Com¬
pany. “I am the head of a family
of three and medical service has
never been much of a burden to
me. The office physician always
helps us out when we get sick. Be¬
sides, there is always the Philip¬
pine General Hospital to go to when
any member of my family gets ill."
D. Julian, a banking and finance
student of the Jose Rizal College
said: “Medical service has never
been of any great worry to me. Our
fam’ly has a doctor and from what
I know, he is not paid much, con¬
sidering the fact that we are many
in the family and that all of us are
regularly examined by him every
month.

CASHING IN ON YOUNG

turned and told the boss she had de
cided to stay an office lawyer for
life. Too much research work,
without being given the chance to
hand'e cases frequently, destroyed
the girl’s legal future
Many an assistant lawyer is sim¬
ply exploited by doing researches
for a book or books his employer
might want to publish. Confiden¬
tial information has it that the as¬
sistant lawyer gets only P25.00 per
month, and he works longer and
harder than a morning-paper re
porter. Just the same, he is not
even accredited with an acknow¬
ledgement when the book, which he
himself has practically made, comes
out.
"Why don’t I get out, you ask?'
he said. "It’s like this. Twenty-five
pesos just now sounds good enough
I have to ask only a little more from
my parents every month. Now if
I leave this work, I’d also lose the
P25.00. Maybe, in a year or two
he'd give me ₱50 or P60, like that
bar topnotcher who’s been here four
years now.
To digress from the subject, the


law schools are to blame for the un¬
warranted sacrifices the young law¬
yers are suffering from to-day.
They would not have employed
themselves as assistant attorneys,
and this without salary, had they
been taught the practical side of the
law. But even law professors, just
like any other academic instructor,
find it easier to teach by rote, and
they simply teach the provisions of
law
What law school, or what law
professor, they say, has taught
them practical conduct of a case,
civil or criminal, from the points of
view of both prosecution and de¬
fense, from the time the complaint
is filed, decided partially by the
justice of the peace court, taken to
the court of first instance, and
later appealed to the supreme
court? All that is done, especially
in the so-called "moot court" trial,
is simply hear the case, receive the
testimony of the witnesses, make a
few perorations, and then the case
is decided on its merits.
Thus, young lawyers will always
permit themselves to be exploited
to learn the tricks of the trade not
learned in school. As it is now.
they believe that to avoid the bit-
terness of exploitation it would
have been better if they had
dropped the law course, became ap¬
prenticed to a lawyer and read law
there. That they say, 'vould have
been the shorter and surer way to
make something out of the law pro¬
fession.

THE CONSTITUTION AT WORK
Continued from page 7


be determined as far as practicable
by competitive examination.
Expressed in the layman’s lang¬
uage, a person must first pass the
civil service examinations before
he can become a government em¬
ployee. He need not take the ex¬
aminations, however, if his posi¬
tion will be policy-determining,
primarily confidential or highly
technical in nature.
But, just now there are some
7,800 temporary employees in the
government service Q u e erl y
enough, there are some 1,600 civil
service eligibles who are still with-
out government jobs.
To strike a more vigorous note,
President Quezon, in an executive
order, promulgated that govern¬
ment employees who are not civil
service eligibles should be weeded
out. His order was made before
December 31, 1935. And tempor
ary appointments were supposed to
have expired on and after Decem¬
ber 31, 1935. Yet the non-eligibles
are as yet seeure in their jobs,
while the civil service eligibles are
still making the rounds of the bu¬
reau offices.
Violation No. 12
Again, to prevent sine die ses¬
sions of the National Assembly
and the consequent log-rolling of
bills, Article 6, Section 12, para¬
graph 2 provides:
"No bill shall be passed or be¬
come a law unless it shall have


vary 6, 1936


 


PAGE 55


been printed and copies thereof in
its form furnished the Members at
least three calendar days prior to
its passage by the National As¬
sembly, except when the President
shall have certified to the necessity
of its immediate enactment..
The first part of the provision
requires a bill to be printed and
copies of the same distributed at
least three days before the bill is
passed. But, wasn’t there a rush
of bills during the last day of the
special session held by the National
Assembly?
The point is, the exception "ex¬
cept when the President shall have
certified to the necessity” of the
bill’s immediate enactment should
have been allowed to remain the
exception, not made, then, the rule.
Violation No. 5?
Everyone knows that the three
departments of government—exe¬
cutive, legislative, and judicial—are
coordinate, coequal, and coextensive.
They are, however, independent
from each other; each supreme
within its own sphere. Neither one
of the departments is subservient
to any other; and no department
may delegate its powers to the
other.
But Commonwealth Act No. 5,
approved December 31, 1935, was
passed by the National Assembly,
Section 3 of which—as others said
made the President a dictator in
some respect—runs:
“Section 3. In order not to de¬
lay reforms in the Government re¬
organization that may appear to be
urgent, the President is hereby
authorized, the provisions of exist-
ing laws to the contrary notwith-
standing, to effect from time to
time, for a period of not more than
six months from the date of the
appreval of this Act, by executive
order, such reforms and changes
in the different executive depert¬
ments, bureaus and offices as he
may consider necessery, with power
to transfer functions, appropria¬
tions, equipment or property
bureaus, offices or personnel fron
one department, bureau or office
to another; classify positions;
standardize salaries; eliminate un¬
necessary personnel; reduce sala¬
ries; combine positions, and do
whatever is necess-ry to effeci
economy and promote efficiency in
the government service
This Act gives the President of
the Commonwealth legislative pow¬
ers, which is, if we might say, un¬
paralleled in the history of a demo¬
cratic country like the Philippines.
The act is a sanction, whereby the
legislative department is shorn of
its powers, almost made subser¬
vient to the executive department.
Section 3, given above, is truly un¬
constitutional, only some wisehead
in the National Assembly made the
law constitutional by adding to it:
“ .Any action taken by the
President pursuant to this author¬
ity shall be reported by him to the
National Assembly for approval at
the next regular session thereof
Such action shall be valid and
subsisting until the National As¬
sembly should provide otherwise."
If in the short space of time of
hardly three months the Constitu¬
bion comg be serctehen here nad


there, it is fair to ask just how
many of such stretchings will be
possible with the passing of time.
Why can’t we stay well within the
provisions of the Constitution and
avoid the impression that those at
the helm of the government think
so little of the fundamental law of
the land that they don’t mind
stretching it out of shape when
convenience so demands?

Judge Gerenimo Paredes: dism’ssed
Hs case illustrates the process bo wnich
the people have lost their confidence in
the courts of jastice.
Another member of the judicia¬
ry never conscientiously read nor
studied the cases in his docket. He
simply decided them on the "amigo
y pariente” style. His decisions,
always appealed from, frequently
clogged the dockets of the supreme
court.
A judge once delayed a simple
motion to decide an administration
case for a whole year, simply be¬
cause the counsel for the other side
was a noted politician. In the
meantime, the defendant adminis¬
trator gathered the fruits of the
property and, when the case was
finally decided, the plaintiff was a
loser by a year’s profit.
In the municipal courts, condi¬
tions, instead of being salutary, are
helplessly unhealthy. Instead of the
accused being presumed innocent
the justice of the peace considers
him guilty until he establishes his
innocence—a flagrant violation of
the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Likewise, it is the constitutional
right of the accused to keep silent
to safeguard him from incriminat¬
ing himself, but there are some
judges who, disregarding procedu¬
ral law, actually force the witness
to testify against himself.

The following day four other
bandits of the Encallado gang sur¬
rendered. These were Jesus Delar¬
mente and Esteban Delarmente,
brothers-in-law of “Capitan Kulas,"
Juan Banagan, and Evaristo Revi¬
llame.
On Jan. 24th, at three o’clock in
the morning, Aurelia Encallado ap¬
peared at constabulary headquar¬
ters in Sampaloc, Tayabas, with a
brother in tow whom she surren¬
dered to the authorities. The bro¬
ther is Dominador Encallado, youn¬
gest son of “Capitan Kulas,
Aurelia Encallado again appeared
on the scene on January 27th, this
time she had two bandits with her:
one her own brother, Gregorio En¬
callado, and Vivencio Ricamora,
both of whom she surrendered to
Governor Rodriguez of Tayabas.
With the surrender of Gregorio
Encallado and Vivencio Ricamora,
only Engracio Encallado, reputed to
be the most bloodthirsty among
“Capitan Kulas” Encallado’s bandit
sons, remained at large, but it de¬
veloped that even this tough was
destined to fall into the hands of the
authorities any moment.
On January 29th killer Engracio
Encallado himself thought he had
enough of the mountains, of irreg¬
ular meals, and playing hide and
seek with constabulary soldiers. He
gave himself up to Governor Rodri¬
guez and confessed participation in
the decapitation of Marcos Niogan
and Policeman Laureano Barnes.
With the surrender of Engracio
Encallado, the work of fetching his
bandit sons for which “Capitan
Kulas” has been released, ended.
The constabulary patrols, ex¬
cept for a rare few, have been or¬
dered withdrawn and returned to
their respective stations. However,
five more outlaws under the leader¬
ship of Maximo Abulon are at large
and it has been reported these ban¬
dits have fled to Rizal province.
Those in the Abulon group besides
Abulon are Bernabe Bagolbagol,
Valentin Ratonil, Nemesio Marti¬
nez, and Deogracias Laforga. It
will be remembered that Maximo
Abulon’s brother was the constabu¬
lary spy who was found hanging
from a tree in Sampaloc during the
Geight of the bandit hunt.
What remains to be done now is
the prosecution of the bandits cap-

prosecution will depend what kind
of verdict the public will finally be¬

CUA PIhDO
COMMENTS
PURGE Wy yHEN President Quezon ordered the dismissal of Judge
W Geronimo Paredes, he made the really first important
step towards increasing the faith of the people in our courts of justice.
The masses have very little, if any, faith in the judiciary. They see in
the courts, from experience, only a sort of glornied third-degree cham-
ber in which they are confused into losing their property, their freedom,
and their rights as citizens. Their concept of a court of so-called justice
is a bewildering room full of people speaking in some unknown jargon,
presided over by a near-god to whom one can talk only through an in¬
terpreter, where one is looked upon as very unimportant and treated as
such.
A continued purge of the violence the President has shown in the
case of Judge Paredes will jolt many an indifferent judicial official into
restoring the respect and consideration that courts of justice owe to every
citizen of the nation. It will force those judges who reruse to recognize
that the poor, who are the majority of the people, have certain rights
that the courts must protect and which judges, above all, must be zealous
in defending.
The President’s stand in the Paredes case, moreover, will serve to
remind those in the judiciary that by the very nature of their positions
they have to be strictiy circumspect in and out of the courts, for it is only
natural that the quality of justice they will dispense will be juaged ac¬
cording to their maividual behavior. It is a foregone conciusion tnat a
judge who is not discriminating in his associations, who tolerates ques¬
tionable frienas, and who does not zealously guard the secrets of his
court is not going to inspire confidence eitner in him or in the court
over which he presides.
By refusing to heed the recommendation of the supreme court that
Judge Paredes be allowed to resign and dismissing the judge instead, the
President shows that he understands that the judicial personnel needs
immediate purging. Should the President succeed in cleaning the judi¬
ciary and restoring, thus, the confidence of the people in their courts, the
President would live as one of the great benefactors of his people even
if he should fail to do anything else.

ANOTHER PURGE RHAT hazing is banned, the so-called tra¬
I ditions of the Constabulary Academy in
Baguio notwithstanding, should be enough to make the cadets refrain
from indulging in it. For theirs is an institution the most important func-
tion of which is the inculcation of the spirit of obedience. A soldier is sup-
posed to obey orders and in a school for soldiers, the first essential is
discipline: compliance with regulations, obedience to orders. The expul¬
sion of eight cadets for hazing is to the point.
Hazing, the humiliation and abuse of lower classmen by upper class¬
men allegedly to foster fraternal spirit and love for traditions, is an evil
imported practice which has already been forbidden in the United States
where the practice seems to have originated. There are a great many
rood foreign practices we can import and imitate. We should stick to
t'e good and refrain from aping everything foreign.

—ITY government laborers whose plan to strike
A JEW STRIKE
Owas averted recently by city authorities are
planing to push the strike through soon.
he city laborers, it is claimed, feel unsatisfied with the arrange¬
ment thich averted their proposed strike and they are planning to ex¬
press toeir dissatisfaction in a most effective manner: a walkout. City
officials, the laborers allege, have promised concessions which have, up
to now, liled to materialize.
Walkats should always be held in contempt but when they are caus¬
ed by the ailure of responsible employers, in this case officials of the
city governient, to live up to concessions promised, then there is no
reason why te public should not extend its sympathy to those planning
to secure rediss the best way they know how.

Results
Wr fE do not know of any act
W the President which had re
ceived more razzing than his pal¬
ling, in a manner of speaking, with
Kulas Encallado. We have never
heard so much love expressed for
Malacanang Palace, No. 1 cars, anc
government dignity as wher almosi
all the Manila papers ganged to¬
gether in purple rage against En
Dado’s getting away with an
dience with the President, a ride
car No. 1-c, a free hair cut, a f
hotel bed.


Malacanang and all that it
stands for, so say those who were
purple in the face, should not hav
been subjected to the humiliation
of entertaining a bloodthirsty
bandit who had made fools of the
constabulary and the governors and
police forces of two provinces.
One thing to remember,
though, whether you like
lue¬
zon method of hunting bandits o
not, a little unbending in Mala
canang, a little modification of the
high-hat, can bring better results.
Onty One?
One judge has already fallen for
making the courts distasteful to the
people. Nobody can convince us
that the general unpopularity of the
local courts is due to Judge Paredes
alone.
*
Getting Berserk
—ROM the standpoint of old-
1 school politicians, a man by
the name of Quezon who resides in
Malacanang has run berserk. He is
doing the unthinkable—in politics.
Some of the unthinkables are:
Judge Paredes’ dismissal, and
Judge Paredes is a brother of Quin¬
tin Paredes, potent politician, one¬
time great Quezon henchman.
His nephew’s expulsion from
the constabulary academy in Ba¬
guio for hazing.
His stiffened stand for the
sanctity of civil service rules.


But we would like to see the highly
tauted stiffening in Malacanang test¬
ed in Laguna. The President has
ordered an offensive against jueteng.
If this offensive can lick jueteng in
Laguna, we are ready to admit Mala¬
anang is not kidding.

From 1900 up to 1934 the leaf
tobacco used for cigarettes in¬
creased from
13,084,037 Ibs. to
326,093,357 lbs.;
an increase of 239225


During the year ending June
30, 1900, the Government
collected from cigarette taxes
$3,969,191
For the year ending June 30,
1934, the same taxes were
$350,299,442
an increase of 8725%
—a lot of money.


It takes mild ripe tobacco
to make a good cigarette.


Cigarettes give a lot of
pleasure to a lot of people.


More cigarettes are smoked today because
more people know about them—they are better advertised.
But the main reason for the increase is that they are made
better—made of better tobaccos; then again the tobaccos are
blended—a blend of American and Turkish tobaccos.


Chesterfield is made of mild, ripe tobaccos.
Everything that science knows about is used in
making it a milder and better-ta ting cigarette.
We believe you will enjoy them.
