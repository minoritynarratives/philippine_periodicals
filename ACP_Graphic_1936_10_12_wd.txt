stamped self-addressed envelope. But
most people who desire to break into
print don’t know that.
The result is that they accompany
their contributions with letters which
are at best unnecessary and at the worst
liable to lessen rather than increase the
chances of acceptance by the editor. You
can guess why after reading “Dear
Editor'" on page 14.
Still and all, we personally enjoy
those letters from writers, and the newer
the writers the better. But then, we are
not the editor. And that creature, as you
know is supposed to be grouchy. Woni¬
derful thing, tradition....
 IKE Dorothy Parker,
M Katharine Brush,
and Saki, John Gals¬
worthy is among the
authors most frequent¬
ly represented in our se¬
ries of select foreign fic¬
tion. This is largely be¬
cause he is one of those
writers whose stories
appeal almost as much
J. Galsworthy to the ordinary reader
as to the out-and-out in
tellectual. And he has written so many
excellent short stories.
A good example is “Defeat," a war
story. “Told by the Schoolmaster” (page
24) is equally good. It is also a war sto¬
ry, emphasizing how terrible war is by
telling of its effect on the love and the
lives of a young soldier and his wife.
First published in The Forum, “Told
by the Schoolmaster” has been reprint-
ed in at least two books, one of them the
last to bear the name of Mr. Galsworthy,
who passed away shortly after his win¬
ning the Nobel Prize for Literature
crowned his great career.
E HEY say that in “human" wars,
X participants sometimes resort
the use of germs. By spread
infection—deadly infection—they n
down those of the other side as ea
as with machine-gun fire or bombs fre
the air.
Man’s inhumanity to man? Yes.
But man’s inhumanity, unlike his chari¬
ty, does not stop at home. He can and
does spread “infection" among other
creatures, too. Read “One Way of Kill¬
ing Anay" on page 17.
But that, we suppose, is self-defense.
Again, the survival of the fittest!

Ilocano secretary is too late as the
burning of the church shed and the
shop of the farm school in Batac took
place six months ago and the shoot¬
ing of Nalundasan occurred a year
ago.
Reads the resolution: “If these of-
fenses did really justify police inter¬
ference from the insular government,
it is incredible that such interference
should be undertaken so long after
the offenses were committed. If the
insular government could wait for
one year or six months before taking
drastic action, why could it not have
waited two weeks more till after the
special election was over?”

The late Sec. of War Dern (before the "mike”), photographed with some local
officials when he arrived last November.


Sec. of Waf George H. Dern, who
was the official representative of
the U. S. President during the P. I.
Commonwealth inauguration, died
of heart disease at the Walter Reed
Hospital of Washington, D. C., at


10:55 last Thursday morning. He
was 64 years old.
He entered the hospital last July 20th
for a “rest and physical check-up." An
attack of influenza three months before
his hospitalization gave rise to a com¬


plication of the heart. The day before
his death, attending physicians noted
that his condition had become alarming-
ly serious.

Jose Gil of the bureau of civil serv¬

vestigation of all erring (or supposed
to be erring) civil service officials
and employees, recommended some
time ago a bill to that effect. With
Director Marabut of the budget bu¬
reau favorably recommending it,
President Quezon endorsed the would-

proposed division will have a person¬

Legaspi (Albay) lumbermen, lab¬

French leave of Manager Jose Canlas
of the Jose Building Company (Legas¬

each to pay for a telegram of com¬
plaint which they sent to President
Quezon the other Wednesday. The
company employed hundreds of lab¬
orers who, because they were not
given their pay, could not in turn pay
for the meals they had and groceries
they got on credit from surrounding
eating joints and sari-sari stores.

Seedol Kelpamalt, the naw mineral

down and corrects one of the real under¬

and narvous rundown canditions—
IODINE STARVED GLANDS When
these glands dan't work properly all
the food in the world can't help you. It
just ian’t turned into Hesh. The result
is, you stay weah and nervaus, tired aut

The most important gland — the one
which actually controls the hady weight
and strength-building—needs a definite
ration of indine all the time—NATURAL
ASSIMILABLE IODINE—not to he con¬
fused with chemical iadines which aftan
prove toxic. Only when the systern gets
an adequate supply of iodine can you
regulate mataboliam—the body's proceas
of converting digested foods into firm
flesh, new, strength and energy.
To get this vital mineral in conve¬
nient, concentrated and assimilahle
form, take Seedol Kelpamalt naw recog¬
nized as the world's richest saurce of
this precious suhatance. It contains


1300 times mere iodine than oysters,
once considered the hest sourca.
tablets alene contain mere NATURAL
IODINE than 486 lha, of spinach or 1387
lbs of lettuce.
Make this test with Seedol Kelpamalt.
First weigh yourself and see how long

Surrenders To
Authorities
YIGHTEEN YEAR-OLD Tomas
4 Bitas of Barrio Lo-ok, Catar¬
Uman, Misamis Oriental, was
ill in bed recently, when he heard
a frantic cry from his mother. He
bolted from his room, saw his aged
mother cornered by his 60-year-old
father Gonzalo who was menacing-
ly wielding a bolo.
Wrests Bolo
The youth sprang, embraced the
old man from behind to disarm him
and to let his mother escape. Fa¬
ther and son struggled. The boy
succeeded in disarming the old man,
grabbed the bolo; instead of throw-
ing the blade away, however, he used
it on his father.
It is said that after the first blow,
which wounded the old man in the
side, the victim pleaded with his son
to spare his life. But the maddened
youth struck the old man again and
again until he died. The mother and
the rest of the children escaped.
Neighbors were afraid to intervene.
Gives Self Up
Carrying the blood-stained murder
weapon, Tomas Bitas walked to the
poblacion to give himself up. Peo¬
ple he met on the way turned pale
when they saw the bloody weapon
and the gore-splattered youth, ran
for cover, believing that the youth
had gone berserk.
He surrendered himself to the
authorities at Catarman, but he was
later transferred to the provincial
jail at Cagayan town. Ironically
enough, while he was being conducted
to the provincial jail, he was
guarded by an elder brother who had

of Antonio Francisco. It appears

running away from home to escape

Victim Drunk
Declaring before Chief of Police
Alberto Ciudadano, the wife of the
victim said her husband had the
habit of threatening everybody in the
family when he was under the in¬
fluence of tuba. That fatal morn-
nig, he was not sober, looked men¬
acing as he reached home from the
sea. Without provocation, he un¬
sheathed his sharp bolo, which he
always carried with him, and chased
the woman who was cooking in the
kitchen.—Rafael A. Bautista.


WANTS FUGATE
IN FORMER POST


Fearful lest the people back home
would misbehave and believing that
recently-appointed Technical Adviser
on Mindanao Affairs James R. Fugate
can do more than any other towards
fostering peace, Assemblyman Datu
Umbra Amilbangsa of Sulu will ask
the Department of the Interior and
President Quezon to send back the for.
mer governor to his old post. The as¬
semblyman-datu believes the time in¬
opportune for the appointment of either
a Christian Filipino or a Moro gover¬
nor as one would arouse the antagonism
of the Moros and the other would in-
tensify the existing factional enmity
there. He says Governor Fugate’s
being made a technical adviser is un¬
fair to him (the governor) and the
province of Sulu.
Since Gov. Fugate was mado technical
adviser, Major Silvino Gallardo, P. A.,
has been acting in his stead.

to-day as it was at the outset of
the revolution.
Towards the close of the week, the
United Press staff man with’ the
northern rebel armies reported the
rushing of reinforcements to the
Guadarrama mountain region and the
strengthening of their positions to a
point where it was doubtful if rebel
planes, tanks, and artillery were suf¬
ficiently strong at present to break
through to Madrid. “The battle north
of Madrid mignt continue for
months,” concluded the correspondent.
Dictatorship for Spain
Rebel leaders, foreseeing victory
for them at the end of the campaign,


organization by Fascist bodies.
As penalty, provinces which re¬
fused to join the revolt will be wiped
off the map and provinces which did
will be fully rewarded. Navarra, for
furnishing thousands of troops to the
rebel cause, will be given an outlet
to the sea; Catalonia will be made a
part of Aragon while Asturias will be
divided into administrative districts.
Conflicting Claims
Thursday last week Mola’s forces
drove forward three miles closer to
Madrid after five days of intense
warfare The advance was aided by
artillery and bombing planes, lead¬
ing to the capture of strategic points
on the heights dominating the Lozoya
valley, 40 miles north of Madrid. The

gathered one day last week in their
headquarters at Burgos, mapped out
plans for the restoration of the mon¬
archy, decided to exterminate Left¬
ists, clean all government offices of
Communists. The dictatorship will
rule "without any parliament," will
maintain close relations with friendly
nations like Germany and Italy.
The Fascist program includes:
1. Suppression of the right to
strike or lockout in industrial dis¬
putes.
2. Creation of a political council
to advise the militarists,
3. Annulment of agrarian re¬
forms.
4. Restitution of confiscated pro¬
perties, including churches, factories
and private estates.
5. Replacement of Loyalist labor


victory placed the rebel troops in ex-
cellent position to continue their
drive toward the capital.
However, Mola had to move his
troops with great speed almost simul¬
taneously in an attempt to check a
surprise government march on Bur¬
gos, the rebel stronghold. Some 2,000
loyalist militiamen marched from
Santona, fought their way to within
less than 25 miles from Burgos.
From the besieged city of Irun, re¬

Confiscation Continues
The government war ministry an¬
nounced that a total of $35,000,000 in
cash, bonds and other securities has
been seized from Catholic institutions
and from the homes of rebels since
the revolt started. The valuables
have been deposited in the Bank of
Spain.
Besieged rebels at Palma, the prin-
cipal city in the Balearic Islands,
radioed General Francisco Franco
that spirits were low at Palma and
that rebel forces there were surrend-
ering unless reinforcements were
sent. At Burgos, it was reported that
last week rebels annihilated a column
of 6,000 loyalists on the Aragon front.
and that Malaga was captured
after kand-to-hand fighting in the
streets. Over 1.000 loyalist deserters
bad joined the rebel army at Malaga.
However, reports in Madrid indicated
that loyalist artillery destroyed the
Oviedo radio station, that the loyal¬
ist navy was shelling Palma, Maiorca..
and that bitter fighting was still in
progress in the rebel-controlled prov¬
inces of Terual, Zaragoza, and Huesca.
will Not Last Long
General Mola and his chief aide,
General Cabanellas, assured news¬
paper men during the week-end that
the civil war "would not last very
long," assured them further that
when it is over, with the insurgents
triumphant Spain would be under a
unified central government. The war
has been dragging for weeks, accord-
ing to the leaders, because a "large
part of the population in the govern¬
ment held territory is ignorant as to
the real situation."
Cabanellas said: “Spain will be
governed in a fashion which will make
it impossible for power ever again to
fall into the hands of dirty politicians,
freemasons, Jews, and similar para¬
sites of human society."
Irun Intact
Rebel forces, repulsed in a despe¬
rate attack on Irun entrenched them¬
selves to resume their siege on the
city, apparently abandoning their
frontal attack as futile against de¬
termined resistance by beleaguered
lovalists. Rebels vainly renewed their
assault on Fort San Marcial at Irun
at dawn last Saturday under Mola’s
orders to capture Irun or die in the
attempt. The insurgents were forced
to retreat to their original positions.
Several thousands were reported killed
on the northern front. Irun’s ammuni¬
tion suoply is dwindling and Com¬
munists were reported at Hendaye
attempting to buy ammunition.
Madrid Bombed
Rebel planes dropped bombs on
Madrid, injured some militiamen.
Prior to the bombing, a rebel plane
flew over the capital, dropped leaf¬
lets warning Madrid would be bombed
unless loyalists surrendered.
The government, however, an¬
nounced completion of air defense
plans, including the maintenance of
a fleet of fast pursuit planes and a
system of sirens to warn the popula¬
tion of impending air attack.
Confusing Reports
The Spanish civil war ended its
sixth week with a confusion of ..i
tles, sieges, marches, and con
marches all made difficult to't e¬
stand due to the conflicting c
radiocast from both sides.
Rebels, at the close of the

region, destroying four battalio
loyalists and capturing seven
guns; bombing of the governmel
base at Malaga; and victorie
other sectors.

A LESSON JTOm KANSAS CITY


1 ENDING action in the As¬
sembly are several measures
A seeking the creation of sev-
eral important towns into chart-
ered cities. Davao, Davao; Zam¬
boanga, Zamboanga; Cebu, Cebu;
and Iloilo, Iloilo, among others, all
want the city status and the bill
concerning the making of Davao,
Davao, into a city has actually
been discussed in the Assembly
although no final decision as yet
has been reached.
In view of the move to create
more cities in this country and be¬
cause of the agitation for a new
form of government for the City
of Manila, the following communi¬
cation from a Filipino lawyer in
the United States should be of
timely interest. Reading in
  (May 7, 1936) a dis¬
cussion of the city manager form
of government for Manila, he sent
us a short description of the gov-
ernment of Kansas City, Mo., think-
ing, and rightly, that it might be
of interest to his countrymen.
I read with interest the article
in the May 7, 1936, issue of your
publication entitled “Efficiency—
Nil.” I am not in a position to com¬
ment on the government of the city
of Manila, for I am from Oroquieta,
Misamis Occidental, and stayed
only a short time in that city prior
to my departure for the United
States. That was seventeen years
ago and I was not old enough to
vote. But I can say that the ex-
amples given by Justice Jose P.
Laurel of American cities success¬
fully operating under the “City
Manager Plan" did not include
Kansas City, Missouri, the most
successful of them all. I wish to
mention Kansas City, especially, be¬
cause Manila is almost its size.
Many forms of city government
were tried by this city since its in¬
corporation in 1839, and the “City
Manager Plan" was finally adopted
to meet the new and complicated
problems of large cities. A great
amount of money and time was
spent by Kansas City officials in
the quest for the most logical form
of city government. On February
24, 1925, a charter was by vote
adopted: For—37,504; against—
8,827 votes.
Note the historical sketch of
Kansas City: “This charter almost
completely changed the form of
government of Kansas City. Here¬
tofore Kansas City has had a coun¬
cil of two Houses, one composed of
representatives from each of the

sixteen Wards, and another known
as the Upper House of the Coun¬
cil, composed of sixteen members
elected at large in the city, and the
Mayor was elected at large, who
was not a member of either House.
Several others of the city officials
were elected in general elections
and the greater part of the work
of managing the city was under
the direction of various Boards,
usually appointed by the Mayor.”
The Council
The new government of Kansas
City, which operates under the city
managerial plan, has a city coun¬
cil upon which all powers in the
city is vested. The council is com¬
posed of nine members, the mayor
being one of these members. The
mayor is elected by voters at large,
is president of the council, votes
as the other members, may require
reconsideration of any measure
acted upon by the council, signs
ordinances.
The council passes ordinances in-
cluding appropriation, tax levy,

The city manager, who receives
a compensation three times more
than that of the mayor, is appoint-
ed by the council. He may be re¬
moved and his compensation is de¬

them from office. He is respon¬

in the council but has no vote in
it. Besides, he enforces ordinances
and laws, advises the council on the
financial condition and needs of
the city, prepares and submits to
the council budget estimates.
The council has no authority over
the appointment or removal of any
employee in these departments, ex¬
cept in the law department. The


law department director (known as
the city counselor) is appointed by
the city manager, removable by the
city council upon the recommen¬
dation of the city manager. The
assistant counselors are appointed
by the city counselor, removable by
the council on recommendation of
the city counselor. There is no
link between these departments and
the council except through the city
manager.

CONCERNING
AINTING
Jose Garcia Villa Now
Discourses On Philippine
Paintings And Pamters
By JOSE GARCIA VILLA


A repraduction of the painting by Mr. Buenaventura, which appeared on  'S
cover some time aga. Villa does not think much of it.


When, early in 1928, Jose
Garcia Villa published the first
(1927) of his annual selections
of the best Filipino short stories
in English, the two periodicals
which gave space to his Roll of
Honor were criticized for allow¬
ing an “upstart" to air his
views. At about the same time,
Philippine Collegian editors got
into hot water for permitting
Villa to write dramatic reviews
which did not spare playwrights
even if they were members of
the university's English Depart-
ment.
In the years that followed,
Villa continued to “disturb'
with his criticisms. These, how-
ever, were usually concerned
with literary works. In the fol¬
lowing article, his comments
have to do with painting—his
avowed first love, for Villa


paints as well as writes—and we
wager he’ll not be less disturb¬
ing in this less familiar role.
FEHE inspiration (negative) for
this article is Mr Gilbert
Perez, who wrote a rhapsody
on Mr Buenaventura’s painting,
which appeared on  ’s
cover some time ago.
Mr Perez finds Mr Buenaven¬
tura’s painting wonderful because
he sees in the picture, not only the
particular woman depicted, but all
the mothers in the world. There¬
fore it is a magnificent painting!
What ingenuous art criticism! That
may be true in literature, but it is


Pablo Amorsolo: wham Mr. Villa con¬
siders among the Islands’ competent
painters.
not true in painting. Mr Perez
may see all the mothers in the
world in that painting, and he may
also, for good measure, see in it all
the Florence Nightingales in the
world, and all the madonnas in the
world—but that is no criterion for
the judgment of painting. The
world of the fine arts is different
from the world of literature. In
so judging a painting, Mr Perez
is applying a literary criterion
upon a work that is not literary. It
is judging by an extraneous stand¬
ard, like judging a poem or a story
by its "moral lesson.” It is like
judging the architecture of a house
by its plumbing, or the beauty of a
rose by its taste. This house has
bing—what magni¬
nt


ficent architecture! This rose
tastes awful—what an ugly thing!
Cabbage tastes very much better
than this rose—what a very beau¬
tiful thing is the cabbage!
Literary emotion is not the
aim of painting, nor of sculp¬
ture—but beauty of line, of form.
of colour (this last, for painting
alone). The judgment for paint¬
ing is pictorial: a painting is to be
judged as a picture, not as some¬
thing else. The emotion provided
by painting is a totally different
thing from the emotion of litera¬
ture. The emotion literature pro¬
vides is humanistic; the emotion
that painting provides is sensuous
emotion, a purely esthetic emotion:
a delight in line and colour, in de¬
sign, in compositional arrangement.
Michelangelo's "Pieta” is good
sculpture because it is beautiful,
not because it deals with noble lit-
erature. El Greco’s “Crucifixion"
is fine painting, not because it
makes you feel the crucifixion of
Christ—as a matter of fact, you do


not feel it at all, and it is not sor¬
row that the spectator feels, but a
great delight, a great joy, at the
beholding of such beauty—it is a
fine painting, not because of its
tale or legend but because it
is magnificent painting. The
fine religious art of antiquity is
good art, not because of its good
Christianity, but because of its
good art. Painting and sculpture,
unlike literature, are not studies on
humanity, but studies on beauty.
They are therefore to be judged,
not from a literary angle, but from
an esthetic angle.
Subject matter is unimportant in
painting. That is why we have what
is called “abstract painting," some
of which are very beautiful, like the
works of Paul Klee and Vassily
Kandinsky and Georges Braque
but who ever heard of abstract
literature? All subjects become and
are significatively equal in pain¬
ting, for painting disqualifies and
disregards all non-esthetic aspects
of a subject. This is also the reason

COLD
WHERE IT LIVES—
in the System!
Don't fool yourself about a cold!
It’s nothing to be taken lightly
nor treated lightly. A cold is an
intelnal infection that will quickly
spread within the system unless
promptly checked. A wise thing to
take for a cold is Grove’s Laxative
Bromo Quinine.
First of all, it is distinctly a
cold treatment and not a “cure¬
all.” Secondly, it is an internal
treatment. Thirdly, it does four
important things. It opens the
bowels, combats the infection in
the system, relieves the headache
and fever and tones and fortifies
the system. That’s the treatment
a cold requires. Don’t be satisfied
with anything less. All chemists
sell Grove’s Laxative Bromo Qui¬
nine. Ask for it by the full name

why a painting of an inanimate
object, a still life, may be as beau¬
tiful, as great as a portrait. Thus
Cezanne’s apples, Van Gogh’s sun¬
flowers, are as equally important as
their studies of people. While all
subjects are not significatively
equal in literature, this is not true
for painting. Literature requires
significant substance because it is
subject to a humanistic valuation;
painting levels all subjects to an
equal importance because it is sub¬
ject to no such valuation. The
valuation for painting is pictorial
valuation. The literary quality of
a painting, any story or tale it may
tell, has nothing to do with its art¬
value, with its value as a painting.
What painting requires is signifi¬
cant form or significant presenta¬
tion, which we may also term sig¬
nificant expression, and of which
more later.
Mr Perez’s judgment, therefore,
on Mr Buenaventura’s painting is
an erroneous judgment. If I look
at a Picasso or a Rouault painting
of a woman, there may not be in
it all the women of the world (it


diocre painters. The mediocre
painters are those who have merely
their craft, who can copy very well
what is placed before them, but
who are unendowed with vision and
imagination, and therefore add
nothing of these to their work.
Most of the painters in the world,
in any age, belong to this group.
They have no individuality: one’s
work is easily confusable with an¬
other’s: if the name Juan Reyes
were not signed to this work. It
could just as easily be attributable
to Pedro Cruz, or to Pablo Manalo,
or to Procopio Opio. Mr Buena¬
ventura’s painting in question be¬
longs to this group. It is no more
distinguishable from the work of a
competent art student or from the
work of another merely competent
painter. Remove the painter’s name
from the canvas, and it will forever
remain anonymous.
Chromophotography is the one
aim of this class of ungifted paint¬
ers, and it is the aim of all our local
painters. The best of our painters
are only chromophotographers. Veri¬
similitude to nature defines their

and his brother. Pablo, are the best among our competent painters, according to Mr. Villa.


may not even look like a woman!)
and yet it is likely to be fine pain¬
ting, for these painters know how
to give significant form to their
works. If I look at Van Gogh’s
painting of his chair, I do not see
in it all the other chairs in the
world, but this painting of Van
Gogh’s, or even that one of his
boots, is superior to Mr Buenaven¬
tura’s painting, in which Mr Perez
sees “all the mothers in the world."
Even an unfinished hand by Mo¬
digliani, or a corner of a picture by
Rousseau, is superior to Mr Bue¬
naventura’s whole painting.
What, then, is the criterion for
distinguishing superior painting?
First, let us assume that we are
speaking of competent painters,
that is to say, painters who have
overcome technical difficulties, who
have learned their craft—those who
know how to paint respectably.
Technical proficiency being under¬
stood, and incompetents barred,
there are superior painters and me¬


painting. The height of their as¬
piration is to achieve a coloured
photograph of whatever is placed
before them. But the aim of art is
not to plagiarise nature but to IN¬
TERPRET it. If the function of
art were merely literal transcrip-
tion, the camera could do it better:
it is much more accurate. But ac¬
curacy is not the aim of painting.
In the days before the discovery of
the camera, the copyist was ap-
plauded for his skill—but bear in
mind that art, like everything else,
progresses. In the early days of
the automobile, if it was able to
run at a speed of fifteen miles, that
was considered most wonderful;
but to-day, who would want such a
car? When water was first dis¬
covered to be HzO, that also was
wonderful; but to-day if I proclaim
to the world that, hallelujah! water
is H2O, that is nothing wonderful
any more. There was a time when
verisimilitude was the end of paint-
ing, but that now mo longer satis¬

Mr. Buenaventura's painting evokad this
article from Mr. Villa.
fies: new conditions, new discoveries
(especially the colour camera) have
made this obsolete. Bear in mind
also that such skill for accuracy
represents nothing but labor and
industry, and the artist is very
much more than that. The artist
is an artist because of vision and
imagination.
Ihe superior painter, then, is he
who is original, who is individual,
who is different from the others.
llis work stands out, is not lost in
the sea of anonymity, is vigorous
with the energy of personality.
This vigor becomes manifest in an
individual style, a style that is per¬
sonalised, that is ascribable to only


one person, to the artist concerned.
His treatment of a subject, thus,
becomes significant because he has
endowed it with unique character,
a unique charm. His presentation
has become significant because it is
unique, it is rare, it is not common¬
place. His lines stand out as his
own lines, his colours as his own
colours: this is what is called sig-
nificant expression, and the form
thereby achieved significant form.
This is true of all the great paint¬
ers of all time. They have each
their own individual style so that
they stand out from all the rest. A
Giotto is distinguishable at a
glance from a Da Vinci or a Botti¬
celli, an El Greco from a Michelan¬
gelo or a Rembrandt. It is impossi¬
ble to confuse their pictures. It is
impossible likewise to confuse the
pictures of Cezanne, Picasso, Matis¬
se, Rouault, Modigliani, Redon,
Gauguin, Laurencin, Lurcat, Bra¬
que, Rousseau, Van Gogh, Chagall,
Kisling, Pascin, Seurat, Manet, de
Segonzac, Klee, Bonnard, with one
another. Their works look like no¬
body else’s but their own. This is
not true of the inferior painters. If
no tag were attached to Mr Buena¬
ventura’s painting, nobody would
know who painted it: it could as
easily be the work of any other
painter. But a painting by Cezanne
is distinctly Cezanne.
Our painters need to develop sig¬
nificant expression, instead of mere
imitation. They need to work each
for an individual style instead of

About Racial Problems -
Judge Lind s e y Thinks
Amalgamation Of Races
Possible But It Will Take
A Long Time Before That
Happens
By P. C. MORANTTE
Hollywood   Correspondent


Self-educated, left to support
his mother and family at 18,
Benjamin Barr Lindsey, subject
of the following interview, is
now a well-known jurist and re¬
former. Active in the organiza¬
tion of the Progressive Party, he
served in the juvenile court of
Denver until 1927, has done
considerable lecturing through-
out the United States on chil¬
dren’s problems. His works in¬
clude “The Revolt of Modern
Youth” and “The House of Hu¬
man Welf ar e: Companionate
Marriage.” One associates him
with companionate marriage as
automatically as one thinks of
Margaret Sanger in connection
with birth control.
N the eighteenth floor of the
Los Angeles city hall tower
O
is the Superior Court pres¬
ided by His Honor, Judge Ben. B.
Lindsey, famous jurist, known in¬
ternationally for his writings on
social, juridical, and political sub¬
jects, and founder and formerly
judge of the juvenile court of
Denver, Colorado. Judge Lindsey
has enjoyed the enviable distinc-


tion, which few men ever have, of
being honored by such gargantuan
minds as George Bernard Shaw
and Emil Ludwig. When these
two world famous writers were in
Los Angeles, they expressed a
desire to interview Judge Lindsey,


and felt it a privilege to meet him.
Judge Ben. B. Lindsey is a small¬
ish man of around sixty-five,
white-haired, penetrating-eyed, be¬
mustached, with a brow that is un¬
usually high and markedly dis¬


tingue. He walks straight, talks
straight with a voice that is modu¬
lated but vigorous. There is some¬
thing in his handshake that im-
mediately puts one at ease. Yet,
while he allows freedom from con¬
ventionality to prevail, he keeps his


dignity intact.
It was afternoon and the court
was in session. There were several
divorce cases which required the
Judge’s decision. Near the court
clerk’s desk—to which place this
writer had been graciously invited
to sit by His Honor—I listened at¬
tentively to the interesting ceremo¬
nial "show” being put on by dis¬
iT'usioned men and women who,
desirous of putting asunder what
God or man-made laws had joined
together, struck me as pitiful as
well as amusing. After Judge
Lindsey had called for a recess, he
came down and walked over to me
for a grip of my hand. He then led
me into his office adjoining the
courtroom, and there we talked on
the subject of race relations.
In Time...
“In God’s own time,” he began,
after introducing me to his lovely
wife, who works in his office as his
secretary, and bidding me sit down,
there will be no distinction of peo¬

lifornia: believes there will be amalgama¬

ples by races. I firmly believe that,
say, in a thousand or more years,
there will be an amalgamation of
races."
He sat down behind a big desk,
fingered the heaps of papers before
him, then leaned back in his swivel
chair. He was still wearing his
stately official toga.
“Here in the United States,” he
went on, looking straight at me,
“I am known for my friendly at¬
titude towards all races. The color¬
ed people, the Jews, the Chinese.
the Japanese, the Filipinos—all

MISCEGENATION IN ETHIOPIA
Strolling through the streets of Asmara (capital of the old Italian
colony of Eritrea) I saw a native woman. She was nursing a white baby
on her doorstep.
The baby had two stupendous and haughty black eyes. He was no
doubt a very beautiful baby. The mother was ugly but as she caressed
him with infinite tenderness her face was illuminated and almost beau¬
tiful.
As for the infant, it would be much better for him if he were black.
Being white his lot will be wretched. Prejudice has already condemned
him. Everybody will turn away from him. Everybody will think the
worst of him.
It is an infamy but nobody has done anything to eradicate it. Not
even the Church. The (Italian) government will have to give some
thought to the matter, for if the new territories are colonized by whites
there will be half-castes aplenty.

The Mendelian laws, which
are admitted as governing the
heredity of plants and animals
fairly accurately, fail when ap¬
plied to the study of half-breeds.
The crossing of whites and
blacks does not show results
of calculable proportions of
mulattoes, whites and blacks,
but a new type which is
tending to be consolidated and
stabilized: a new race is being
born..... namely, that of the
American Negro who is a verita¬
ble neo-black. Further, when the
origin of present races is sought
In the prehistoric and historic
past, even of those which are
claimed to be pures, it becomes
apparent that all human groups
have been half-breeds for tens
and thousands of years. What
is termed “race" is nothing but
a group with apparently fixed
characteristics, which have re¬
sulted from innumerable combi¬
nations
—M. Neuville in Les Nouvelles
Litteraires.


these races are one to me. After
all, we are biologically the same.
Race prejudice is totally opposed to
the Christian spirit."
“Concerning racial discrimina¬
tion, do you think society at the
present time is becoming tolerant or
intolerant?” I asked.
“At the present time society in
general is intolerant,” the Judge re¬
plied. “But such racial intolerance
is a temporary lapse born of pre¬
judices rather than realities. So¬
ciety flows in waves,” Judge Lind¬
sey indicated the waves he meant
by undulating his right hand over
his desk. “To-day race discrimina¬
tion is strong, tomorrow it will fall
back. One thing is patently certain:
we are constantly moving forward,
getting farther from the views,
habits, and tastes of the prejudiced
and ignorant people of many years
ago. We are getting more civilized
in our thoughts and actions, even
as in the arts and sciences. Society
cannot escape the understanding
which marks civilized peoples. And,
I reiterate, time there will be when
peoples of all climes will be just one
race."
The noted man paused for a mo¬
ment to look into the pages bf
  wherein my articies on
Dr. Paul Popenoe, the eminent so¬
ciologist, appeared.

about the amalgamation of the
races,” the Judge then continued.
'And I am for it. But don’t mis¬
understand me. I am not encourag¬
ing it at the present time. I am
not discouraging it, either. Let
time take care of it. As to the Fi¬
lipino-American girl case, let us
leave it to the individual parties.
Dr. Popenoe here counsels against
mixed marriage. In some respects
I agree with him. But I believe it
is wrong to generalize on the ques¬
tion and I realize it is impossible
in many cases to prevent mixed
marriages between Filipinos and
the so-called 'white’ American girls.
I have Japanese and Chinese friends
who are happily married to white
American women. Undoubtedly
there are also Filipinos who are
happily married to white American
women. With proper conditions
and motives and mutual affection.
I see no reason why a marriage be¬
tween a Filipino and an American
girl shouldn’t be a success. How¬
ever, I suspect that if one hundred
Filipinos marrying white American
girls would be compared with one
hundred native American men
marrying their own women, there
would be more failures in the for¬
mer than in the latter group."
“Upon what conditions should
Filipinos base their marriage to
white American girls in order to
insure a happy family?” I queried.
Fundamental Factors
“Upon health, good character,
and genuine love or mutual affec¬
tion," he replied. “Those are the
fundamental factors,—of course,
the economic factor is also very
important."
“Speaking of Filipinos associat¬
ing with white American girls, do
you feel or know that more crimes
committed by my people can be at¬
tributed directly or indirectly to
it?” was another question I asked.

The Departments
The public works department is
subdivided into the division of en¬
gineering, the division of street
repairs, the division of street clean¬
ing, the division of buildings and
inspections, and the division of
utilities.
The fire department has two di¬
visions: one for fire fighting and
another for fire prevention. The
divisions of social service, markets,
recreation, and legal aid compose
the welfare department. The
health department is composed of
the division of administration and
records, the division of inspection
of child hygiene, the division of
communicable diseases, and the di¬
vision of hospitals.
The water department is sub¬
divided into the division of engine¬
ering and the division of collec¬
tions. The division of accounts,
the division of treasury, the divi¬
sion of licenses, the division of as¬
sessments, and the division of pur¬
chases and supplies make up the
finance department


“I don’t know exactly about that.
Of course I have come across cases
which point to such a cause. But
I can’t say definitely about the
crimes committed by Filipinos as
any different from those by Amer¬
icans. Dr. Popenoe may know
much about it. He has access to
data pertaining to that matter.
You know, in this country, you can
find no greater authority than Dr.
Popenoe when it comes to these so¬
cial problems. He is also a great
biologist.”
Realizing that I was detaining
him from his duty at the bench, I
bade the Judge and his charming
wife good day. This was my second
visit to his office. During my first
visit, which was a brief one, Judge
Lindsey told me about himself and
his friendship with Booker T.


Washington, the great negro edu¬
cator.
Ah, Booker was a great
friend of mine. I used to invite
him to dinner," said the Judge.
Judge Lindsey also mentioned
the Hon. Frank Murphy. "Frank
and I are chums, yes. We had din¬
ner at the Ambassador a few weeks
ago when he was in town. Did you
see him?'
“Yes, I did,” I replied.
"Frank is a great busy man.
You know, I should like to see the
Philippines. Some day I am going
there. By the way, I have heard
your President Quezon speak over
the radio and I admire his oratory.
He is a brilliant leader. I have
great respect for your leaders over
there.”

ing his patience by descriptions of
the material or of yourself. But
few people, we know only too well,
have heard that warning; and we
suspect that even they did hear it,
they would not heed it.
Anyway, any editor will tell you
that with every mail, his desk is
littered with letters which per¬
haps he would miss if he stopped
getting them—but which, never-
theless, are often a trial now that
he is getting them. Sample a few
kinds.
A critical examination, made by
a staff member of this weekly, of
the letters accompanying hundreds
of manuscripts received by the ed-
itor revealed the fact that very
few stick to the brief, formal, cut¬
and-dried form. The bulk of the
letters fly off. at a tangent with a
vengeance.
The Return Envelope
One thing these letters have in
common: their aversion to men¬
tioning the return envelope. If this
round-trip conveyance is alluded to
at all, it is usually in the post¬
script—as if it had not occurred to
the author until then that the man¬
uscript might by some chance be
rejected. One contributor lightly
mentioned the fact that he had de-
liberately not enclosed any self-ad¬
dressed stamped envelope lest it
prove too tempting for the editor.
One well-known short story writer
persistently refuses to enclose a re¬
turn envelope with his manuscripts.
A young man from Tagbilaran,
Bohol, recently sent a manuscript
for editorial consideration, with
this postscript in his note:
In the event this "little
thing" will not be able to wea¬
ther the literary grilling, I am
enclosing herewith a stamped
envelope. Note that the enve¬
lope is unsoiled, so you can use
it yourself gratis should you


not care to return this manus¬
cript. After all, why not pass
this to the printing room, yes,
why not?
Why It Should Be Published
Some authors forget that the
timeliness, the appeal, and the
make-up of an article are its stron¬
gest recommendations. There are
those, for example, who request the
publication of an article as a spe¬
cial favor. For instance, here is a
letter from a contributor residing
in Manila:
May I request this favor
from you to kindly publish in
next week's issue an article 1
sent three weeks ago the title
of which is "
I mentioned to my friends
that this article might come
out soon, and they are waiting
eagerly for it. Mr.
(the


“hero" of the' article) might
have heard about it, too; and
this places me in an embarras¬
sing position, as they might
think I am telling them a lie.
Kindiy do this as a special fa¬
vor, will you?
The article mentioned did not
“come out soon.” In fact it never
came out at all. Reason: it sim¬
ply was not good enough for pub¬
lication.
Probably the budding author
from Occidental Negros who wrote
the following letter did not mean
it that way, but he certainly made
a very strong self-recommendation:
“ JI will be very thankful
to see my article written in
your publication with the sin¬
cere hope that your publication
will be more dignified and
more appreciated by our peo¬


ple...”
An other writer-in-the-making,
who resides in Capiz, put it in a no
less subtle way, thus:
I do not wonder if you find
this manuscript intriguing, for
quite likely you may find it
difficult to classify. In all
earnestness, however, I en¬
deavored to make it a literary
piece... I hope you may use
it, at last, as a literary piece,
not as a story, to which it has,
I am afraid, but slight preten¬
sions.
Sensitive short story writers--
those who call themselves such,
anyway—would not relish the all
too sharp distinction made by this
Capiz contributor between a liter¬
ary piece and a short story.
One of the older short story
writers mentioned a very novel
reason why his story should be pub¬
lished. “I sent this to America,"
he said, "but this does not prevent
my sending it to you, I suppose.
want to give Villa another chance
to put it in the Criminal Record."
Read—And Seen Too
Not infrequently, contributors
include a photo of theirs with their
manuscripts, as if that had been a
slip. In other words, they mention
nothing about the photo’s being, if
possible, run with the article. In
fact they do not allude to the photo
at all, trusting to chance that the
editor would see what they want.
There are some, however, who
make no bones about it. For exam¬
ple, a Samar contributor bluntly
stated that, “"If in your opinion it
is worth publishing, I further re¬


quest you to include the attached
copy of my picture."
A photo is better than no photo

but an old writer complained about
his photo which had been run seve¬
ral times in this weekly.
“Can’t you publish a better pic¬
ture of mine than that old one look¬
ing like a sap?” he wanted to
know in a lengthy letter he sent
the editor. “That was me when I
was sixteen and it does not even
look very virginal. I have pictures
in our annual—1932—which will
look more decent.
Overfamiliar Letters
Many of those who have had sev-
eral stories or articles published
and who consequently consider
themselves as having "arrived,"
become very familiar in their let-
ters. Consider this one:
Enclosed please find (if yon
can) two (2) count 'em—man¬
uscripts. I hope (very fervent¬
ly) that they are worthy of
publication. I must admit
that one is experimental—but,
what the heck, why not?
Yours (but not sincerely),
H.......
PS. I know you are asking
which one (Or will you? Ask,
I mean.) The answer is: Ei¬
ther (surprise, surprise).
The same (MUG)
More P. S.
Believe it or not (courtesy of
Ripley), that’s all there is.
There isu't any more! (Did I
hear you sigh in relief? I
thought so!)
Modesty Aside
It is axiomatic that modesty is


not one of a writers strong points.
For instance, an old writer pre¬
faced his letter with, “Now tell me
I have written a story. A
contributor from Mindoro re¬
cently enlightened the editor with
this fact: “With the little effort
exerted in this new task, I finally
came to a finish in the form of a
short story. Will you please in¬
clude my short story in the next is¬
sue of your weekly?”
"I’m not a genius but I am
starving," modestly admitted a
short story writer from Tarlac.
Then, not so modestly: “Have you
received, accepted rather, enough
stories for your Christmas num¬
ber? I have one under preparation
for which I can cast aside my mod-
esty. Yes, it ought to be good."
Why Editors Get Gray
And then there are those who go
further than requesting that their
works be printed—and printed in

being lost in a common mediocrity.
We have a vast army of incompe¬
tents, not even competent, but of
course these do not count.
Among our competent painters
the best of course are Fernando and
Pablo Amorsolo. But even they do
not seem to me to rise to true
creative expression.
But then
genius is a very rare thing. Even
in so big a country as the United
States, one can find only four or
five true painters. For the bene¬
fit of those who are seriously in¬
terested in painting, I shall men¬
tion that these are John Carroll.
Alexander Brook. Yasuo Kunivoshi


(a Japanese who migrated to
America at an early age), and
Georgia O'Keefe. I wonder if any
of our painters has heard of them,
or of the French group I have men¬
tioned before. If not, they had bet¬
ter do some studying or they will
never develop to excel.
(Additional names for the French
group are: Dufy Derain, Soutine,
Vlaminck, Chirico, and of course
Renoir. The American group can¬
not be much extended: most Amer¬
ican painters excel in mediocrity.
England has only one significant
contemporary painter: Augustus
John.)

Most People Are As Maxun Gorky
Shows In This Article


Maxim Gorky, the great Rus¬
sian writer who died only re¬
cently, was in reality Alexei Ma¬
ximovitch Peshkov. He was
born in 1868, orphaned at an
early age, and failed to get a
university education because of
poverty. It was from a steamer
cook whose helper he was that
he obtained his passion for lite¬
rature. Several months ago he


died lamented by Soviet Russia
because of his long sympathy
with the revolutionary spirit
which finally led to the present
regime in Russia.
The following article, reprint-
ed from Magazine Digest, shows
how careful an observer Gorky
was. It might interest you, after
reading the article, to find for


yourself just what strang e
things you, yourself, do when
alone.
S I was passing by the Troit¬
zky Bridge last night I saw
Aa young woman standing on
the bridge. She was small and fair
and her grey-gloved hands were
clasping the railing. For a mo¬
ment I thought that she was going
to jump into the Newa. But she
was only sticking out her pointed
and spiteful little tongue at the
moon.
The latter looked like a sly old
fox, slowly gliding through a cloud
of smoke. It was big and very red
—just like the face of a drunkard.
Perhaps the young woman wanted
to annoy the moon for something
it had done to her. Anyway, she
seemed very serious about it.
Thinking about this little inci¬
dent I remembered other funny
little incidents of this kind, in
which I have always taken a great
interest. For, the more I observe
men and their behaviour when
they deem themselves alone, the
more I feel that I am looking at
madness. I could not call it by
any other name.
It occurred to me for the first
time while I was still a young boy.
The English clown Rondal was

author of the accompanying article, being carried to its final resting place. One of the pall¬

dor of the circus after the per¬
formance. As he passed by a mir¬
ror, he took off his top hat and
respectfully bowed to his own
image. There was not a human
being around. I was sitting in the
water-tank above his head, he
could not see me, nor could I hear
his steps. I just happened to put
my head out at the very moment
he was bowing before himself. To
this day I distinctly remember my
dismay, embarrassment and be¬
wilderment at so unusual an atti¬
tude. But then I thought that,
after all, Rondal was a clown and
an Englishman on top of it, that
is a man who made a business of
eccentricity.
Many years later I called on
Anton Tchekhoy one day. They
told me he was in the garden and
as I reached the porch I saw him
sitting all alone, trying to capture
a ray of the sun with his hat and
put both on his head, unsuccess¬
fully of course. I could see how
annoyed he was at his failure. He
went on for some time and gradu¬
ally his face took on a wicked ex¬
pression. Finally he gave his knee
a tap with his hat, hurriedly
pulled it on his head, pushed his
little dog aside with a kick of his
foot and, casting a last searching
glance at the sky, he slowly walked
teward the house. When he saw
me on the porch he smiled: "How
are you? Did you ever read in
Balmont’s lyrics the verse, “The
sun smells of herbs?” What a silly
thing to say! In Russia the sun
smells of laundry soap and here
of Tartar sweat."
I saw him another time vainly
trying to squeeze a thick red pencil
into the neck of a sma’l medicine
bottle. Of course it was a hopeless
undertaking. lle must have been
aware that he was trying to break
one of the immutable physical
laws. Yet he devoted himself to


this occupation with utmost seri¬
ousness and the obstinate patience
of the experimenter.
Leo Tolstoy asked a lizard:
“Do you feel well, you?” The lit-
tle creature was basking in the
sun by the roadside and Tolstoy
was standing before it in his char¬
acteristic pose, fingers tucked in
the belt of his blouse. Then, cau¬
tiously peeping around, the great
man sighed and confessed: “But I
don’t feel at all well..."


The great chemist Tishwinsky
sat in my dining room studying
his own image reflected in the cop-
per serving tray. He was terribly
serious... “Well, my friend, how
are you getting along?” he asked.
The image did not reply. He
heaved a deep sigh and his face

the same enervation to us, and we
stood silent and watchful, as if
waiting for her first move.
Her sobs were growing weaker
and weaker. Finally, they were on¬
ly like distracted sighs. But after
her eyes came to rest on us, stand¬
ing there silently watching her, she
broke into a loud fit of weeping.
She suddenly knelt down on the
ground, covered her face with her
hands, and cried louder. Some of
the men approached her and trieda
to calm her, but when comforting
hands were laid on her shoulders,
she flung them away and shouted
that she be left alone.
For a time we did not know what
to do with her. Later on, however,
her parents came and cajoled her
into going back to town. She
walked between her parents, cry-
ing like a child.
Y nightfall we had found only
two bodies. One was that of
Busio. The other was so consider¬
ab'y disfigured that it was not rec-
ognizable as yet. We put the bo¬
dies on makeshift stretchers and
carried them to the village.
A representative from the com¬
pany met us in the village and took
care of the bodies. With him was
an embalmer from the funeraria
in town who began to embalm the
bodies so that they would last un¬
til the company received word from
the families of the dead men as to
what was to be done with the bo¬
dies. A car from the funeraria


came to the village and carried the
dead to town.
It is the policy of the company
to indemnify the family of a work-
er who meets with an accident
while working for the company.
The company pays thirty pesos to
the fami'y that is willing to let
the company bury the dead. But
if the family wants to have the
body, the company shoulders the
transportation of the remains to
the family, but does not feel obliged
to pay any more money. Usually,
however, it sends five or ten pesos
as -a sort of consolation to the be¬
reaved family.
We watched the car speed away,
and when we could not see it any
more, we talked about the accident
I moved from one group to another,
unable to make up my mind to go
home. And even though they
talked mostly about the accident
and I was beginning to think that
I could not stand it any longer, yet
I could not go anywhere else for I
did not want to be alone and be left
to my own thoughts. Perhaps it
was just my imagination, but I
seemed to sense that the atmos¬
phere in the village had become
ominous and subtly suggestive of
death. The village was unusually
quiet, as if these workers who lab¬
ored in constant danger had been
brought too close to the reality of
their danger. The women were al¬
so strangely subdued. I hastened
away from them and went to the
hut where I boarded.
I thought I could sleep easily af-


ter such a fatiguing day, but I was
mistaken. After I had put out the
light, the darkness oppressed me
and I seemed to hear the breathing
of Demetrio beside me. I hastily
relighted the kerosene lamp, but
even the light could not dispel my
nervousness, so I slipped down
from the house and went to an
open-all-night restaurant. There
were many people there and they
talked loud'y.
I was glad when at last the faint
glimmer of dawn broke on the ho¬
rizon. Outside the restaurant, the
streets were already thronged with
men going to the mines. The men
who had been in the establishment
also came out, some going home to
sleep and others going to work.
ate my breakfast, and when I went
out I fell in with a bunch that was
going to dig out the dead.
By the middle of the afternoon.
we had extracted the last body.
This with two others we had pre¬
viously found were placed in the
waiting car sent by the funeraria
and taken to town. I had seen De¬
metrio’s body taken from under a
huge boulder, and in some parts it
looked as if it had been ground to
a pulp. Even before the stone had
crushed him, he had already been
killed by the blast. One of his
arms had been torn away and his
face had been so mutilated that in-
stead of a face, he had a blackened,
raw mash of flesh. The sight of
him greatly unnerved me and some
of the men who dug with us turned
away.
Pepe, who had been at a distance
from the others of Demetrio’s men
when the accident occurred, was
not so horribly mangled, but he
was as limp as if all the bones in
his body had melted... After the
car had left, we slowly wended our
way back to the village and re¬
turned the implements we had bor¬
rowed.
Y N answer to the telegrams sent
Iout by the company after the
accident, two of the families re¬
plied that they would let the com-
pany bury their dead. One of the
men who died did not have any
family and nobody seemed to
know where he came from, either.
Demetrio’s wife replied that she
would have his body, and Pepe’s
remains were taken by his wife.
And so the company buried three
of the dead, and after we left the
cemetery we were treated to seve¬
ral glasses of beer.
Demetrio’s body remained in the
chapel of the funeraria waiting
for the boat that docked once a
week in town. Sometimes a bunch
of miners would drop in and stay
for a while, then others would come
in after them. For the first two
days and nights, it was easy to
keep vigil over his dead body.
Some miners brought guitars with
them and others sang and the
nights passed quite easily. But
when I went there, I saw that the
lid of the coffin had been shut, un¬
like the others an the chapel where


one could see the bodies of the
dead. Perhaps the corpse that lay
inside that coffin was terrible to
look at even though it had been
dressed.
On Sunday morning, the boat
docked in port. We had not sur¬
mised that Demetrio’s wife would
turn up for the body herself, but
she came with her son. Demetrio
had often told us of the wife he
left and his three chi'dren, and
through him we had come to have
intimate glimpses of his family
life. He never failed to send his
earnings to his wife, and some¬
times she sent him home-made
delicacies which he pressed us to
share with him. Now this must Be
his eldest son who was now in the
Sixth Grade, and I seemed to hear
Demetrio’s chuckle when he reeled

Dear A.E.L.—Literary editors
and fiction readers have missed the
stories of Casiano T. Calalang.
Yet, he is still very much alive. He
resides in Balayan, Batangas, and
is happily married to a beautiful,
rich Batanguena. Tell me, would
you still write stories if you were
happily married to a rich and beau¬
tiful girl, ha Lit? Anyway, I no¬
tice that once writers have “arriv-
ed," they rest on their laurels. You
yourself used to write many sto¬
ries, but now that you are the fa¬
mous A.E.L., you—well, haven’t you
lost the urge to write?—P. B. Men¬
doza, Manila.
Dear P. B. M.—Lost the urge
to write? Oh, no! Never. Never
in this world. Never while grass
grows, water flows, money goes,
and women pose. Since 1925,
no year has passed without my
writing at least two stories.
Like A. B. Rotor, I have never
stopped reading, writing, and
remembering—especially remem¬
bering. As to whether a rich
and beautiful wife could stop
me, all I can say is it has not
stopped even Mr. Calalang:
within a few days, his latest
story will appear in The National
Review. And about that “cer¬
tain girl," your remarks on
whom I have had to censor: you
may be right about the first in¬
itial, but the second is decidedly
wrong.—A. E. L.
* X
Dear A.E.L.—Who wrote the
"Songs to Ninon" which you ran
last year? Delfin Fresnosa and a
host of friends are attributing the
authorship to me—which is quite a
mistake, as you know. I like the
songs myself and wish they were
from my own little treasury. I
think they were by either Alvero
or Siat.—Greg. A. Estonanto, Gubat,


Sorsogon.
Dear G. A. E.—The author of
“Songs to Ninon" is a better
poet than Alvero, Siat, you, or
myself (to whom they have been
attributed by some people,
among them Celestino M. Vega).
The curious thing is that it was
I, rather than the author, who
decided to keep “E" anonymous.
I’m sorry, but I can’t give my
reason here without divulging
certain things not meant for
print.—A. E. L.
* *
Dear A.E.L.—The present trend
of local columnists seems to be to¬
wards “double personalities.” Mr.
Lopez has his Margo, Mr. Dayrit his
D.R.E., and R. R. Roces, Jr., his
Justo Q. Lintik. Now I’m wonder¬
ing why Mr. Mangahas, Mr. Ri¬
vera, and A.E.L., among others,
have not followed suit.—Manuel
Abad Gaerlan, San Juan, La Union.
Dear M. A. G.—A. E. L.,
like to think, was not meant to
follow suit—not, at all events, if
the "suits” are merely people
whom he knows not wisely but
too well. Only the other week,
a girl columnist asked me: "Why
can’t people be original? Just
because Dayrit has his D. R. E.,
this or that columnist is trotting
out an alter ego. Why, I think
even Yay Panlilio and the Ka¬
leidoscopers have gone and done
likewise!"
Lest I be included in that con¬
demnation, may I remind all
and sundry that my other self,
Mad’limpook, was introduced in
this column on August 17, 1932
—at which time, I think, D.
R. E. couldn’t have been more
than a gleam in Mr. Dayrit’s left
eye. (By the way, M. A. G., you
can’t be a very ardent Little


Things fan: you don’t seem to
have heard of Mad’limpook,
whereas I have quoted him re-
peatedly during the past four
vears, most recently on July 9,
1936.)
And yes: Mr. Mangahas, too,
is not without a Mr. Hyde.
Sometimes he is called AE, at
other times A. E. L.; but at no
time, please, is he yours indul¬
gently, A. E. L.

MODERNANITIES. — When a
number of our writers named their
group St. Veronica’s Press. I asked
some of them why they had chosen
the name Veronica. Mere whim,
they said.
But perhaps the word has a pro¬
found meaning known only to the
elect among the literarty of our
day. For, according to Time, the
following is among the verses fea¬
tured in the first number of the
new transition:

The largest of the boards treated
was 157 centimeters long, 15 centi¬
meters wide, and 5-1 2 centimeters
thick—or a volume of 12,952.5 cu¬
bic centimeters. Only 3.5 grams of
Paris green were used for this (27
milligrams per cubic centimeter).
and this amount killed every ter¬
mite in it.
Portions of infested buildings
were next treated with the poison¬
ous Paris green. After one treat¬
ment, it took from 1 to 14 days be¬
fore the termites disappeared from
the tunnels in the wood. Until now
the parts treates have not been re¬
infested.
Underground Termites
Subterranean termites were also
treated with Paris green dust. Only
8 gram was introduced into the
tunnels on the stump of a tree, and
in 2 days all termites disappeared
from the stump, and termites were
found dead to as deep as 75 centi¬
meters below the earth surface.
Fifteen grams of the poison were
introduced into a mound (known
as punso in Tagalog and bunton in
Ilocano). After 20 days all the ter¬
mites in the whole colony were
killed. A wooden post was treated
with only 2.3 grams of the poison.
and in 1 day, all termites disap¬
peared from it. No termite was
found 1.5 meters below the surface
of the earth. That was as far as
they dug, so where the insects went
has not been determined. A tun¬
nel in another wooden post was
similarly injected with the green
dust, and all termites in it repaired
to parts unknown. The post has
not been visited again by the in¬
sects.

PNHERE'S a new person at the
Radio Manila studios who will
Abear watching. No, he’s not
a suspicious character at all. He’s
a friend of Gareth Garlund who re¬
cently arrived from the States to
see what our fair country is like.
He used to exchange letters with
Gary and suddenly surprised the
latter one day by sending a cable
saying that he would be arriving
within a month! Perhaps Gary’s
long accounts of the many interest-
ing things about Manila aroused
his curiosity. Anyway, he’s here
to stay—at least while Gary is
here. And he has been tried out
as an announcer—and was not
found wanting. And he sings
very well, too. So that local fans
may soon hear him over the micro¬
phone in the capacity of both an¬
nouncer and crooner. His name:
Billy Coe. (Gary calls him “But-
cher.")
 ARON UNTERHEISEN is al¬
Bways the "spice of the pro¬
gram," off or on the air. (You
are all well-acquainted with the
way he dominates the Amateur
Hour.) At the recent dance given
by Mr. and Mrs. Remigio Mat.
Castro for their daughter Milagros
(Miss Radio of 1936) on the occa¬
sion of her birthday, he "pepped
things up” by: (1) playing the vio¬
lin; (2) playing the drums with
the orchestra; (3) playing an or¬
iginal obligato for Andrea Badur¬
ria’s rendition of “Indian Love
Call”: (4) dancing intricate steps
with Luz Mat. Castro; and—oh, a
lot more things that only the Bar¬
on can do and get away with!
NPEAKING further of that bril¬
S liant affair, we noticed that a
lot of notables from the local radio¬
land were present (take us, for in¬
stance!), as well as a whole crowd
of distinguished personages from


the vernacular literary circles of
Manila and the near-by provinces.
Fred Da Silva, master technician
of Radio Manila, and Joe Lorenzo,
one of his ablest assistants, were
there. (By the way, these two
gentlemen surprised us by their
“too, too divine” dancing, specially
the waltz). And Francisco (Koko)
Trinidad, eyeing all the pretty
girls as usual. And Harry Fen¬
ton. And Luis Nolasco and that
sophisticated pianist of the air,
Mike Velarde, Jr. Lovely Andrea
Badurria of the “Are You Listen¬
ing” broadcast charmed us with her
vocal solo. Bernie Nolasco of the
same program was there, too, all
smiles and good-will the entire
evening. The Troubador sang
“Where Am I?”, as if he wanted
to be reassured that he was there.
Eddie Unson and Herminio Ve¬
larde, Jr., forgot all about the
crooning business for a while and
devoted themselves to the Terpsieu¬
rean (I’m positive we didn’t get
that right but we're too lazy to get
the dictionary) art whole-heartedly.
Cely Navarro, "lovely song-bird of
KZEG," quoting the announcer of
that station, was her usual charm-
ing self. Larry Rosales, star of
KZIB whom we hadn’t seen for al¬
most a year, was there, too. He
shook our hand many times as he
told us that he recently arrived
from the provinces, where he had
been working during that period
of absence from the city. Conspi¬
cuous by his absence was program¬
director Ariston Avelino. (Mr.
and Mrs. Johnny Harris could
not come, either, because the latter
has not yet fully recovered from
her recent illness.)
PERSONALITIES
The Mystery Singer—They still
call him thus, although it is no
longer a mystery that this popular
is a law-grad from the U. P. and


is a full-fledged abogado now.
Which must be the reason for his
using words in ordinary conversa¬
tion that make us rush to the near¬
est Webster’s, in
in order to under¬
stand what he’s
talking about.
When he wants
to begin, he says
“Let’s commence."
When he can’t un¬
derstand, he says,
“It is not lucid
enough, I can’t
The Mystery Singer c o m prehend.
Please illuminate
me.” Etc. But when he gets sore,
he becomes as slangy as the rest
of us ordinary folk. He says:
“Aw, go climb a tree and stay
there!” He waxes more eloquent
when he gets angrier. He says:
“Go climb and tree—and jump!”
Alma Corro—She claims she is
“three persons in one” and gives
the following as her proof: she was
christened Alma Teresita Gooch;
she is known as a singer as Alma
Corro; but she announces as Ro¬
berta March. Therefore... She is
tall and has been told time and
again that she resembles Maureen
O'Sullivan. She used to be a mez-
zo-soprano. Then she studied voice


culture and now she hits high C—
just like that! She used to sing
only popular songs (when she was
a mezzo). But now she sings only
semi-classics. Like the songs from
Lily Pons’ screen production. And
operatic compositions by Victor
Herbert, Romberg, Friml, and Je¬
rome Kern. She has "moods."
Sometimes she is gloomier than
the "suicide song" and then again
she is gayer than the gayest spring
song. So we call out: "Mandalu¬
yong!” And she curls up her nose
and says “Woof! Woof!”
KLIB NOTES
most delightful program to be
Aknown as “Escolta On The
Air" will soon be broadcast as
a regular feature over station
KZIB. This program will not only
be the “tops” as far as the musical
portion of the program is concern¬
ed, but the humor and with it will
pack along with it will provide
unique entertainment and bring
many a smile to the listeners.
The first program will naturally
be a sort of a test, in as much as it
will be the first time that a pro¬
gram of this sort has ever been
presented in the Islands, although
it is extremely popular on the lar-
ger stations of the States.

“Lysol'
for feminine hygiene


The importance of using
“Lysol” in feminine hy¬
giene, which is so vital to
every woman, cannot be
over-emphasized. The
method used must be cho¬
sen withgreat care. In many
instances women have in¬
jured themselves seriously,
mainly due to the use of
over-caustic preparations
that irritate the membranes,
or are much too weak to
be dependable as hygienic
agents.


The universal use of "Lysol" in
hospitals where thorough and safe
disinfection is insisted upon is posi¬
tive proof of its safety and efficacy.
Surely, then, "Lysol” is correct for
normal feminine hy
giene. You can place
tull confidence in


“Lysol” to give your body the me-
ticulous care it requires. Lysol is sold
at all drug stores—it is never sold in
bulk—insist on the brown bottle in
the yellow carton. It comes in three
convenient sizes, is highly concen¬
trated, therefore more economical
than cheaply priced substitutes,

CAVALCADE ()
“Murphy is back in the city!”
“We must have a reception for
him... maybe a dinner... maybe a
dance.. may be both... and
speeches... maybe an entertain¬
ment program... so buzzes the
Filipino colony of this Fourth City
of the world’s First Nation.
All this takes your writer back
to about three years ago! The day
Detroit’s Mayor Murphy left for
the Philippines to the governor¬
generalship and into the very
hearts of my paisanos.
The day he was tendered his ap-
pointment. Pinoys virtually wore
out the City Hall steps with their
incessant coming and going to the
Mayor’s office They smothered
him with congratulations, wishes
for his success and every sort of
good luck Some assured him he'd
love the Islands and the people,
while the more astutely business¬
like cornered him for jobs. In all
my born days, I’ve never seen so
many willing bodyguards, secret¬
aries, interpreters, etc., offer their
services so generously and so
whole-heartedly if just a trifle
too frantically! Others, too many
of them, simply "hung around"
like my paisanos alone know how!
Well, a dinner-dance was prompt.
ly arranged Speakers were not
hard to coax (as if you didn’t
know this!) and as to those who
were to take part in the enter¬
tainment end of the program, they
too agreed that it was quite an
honor to be able to entertain our
(then) new g--g
After the dinner a string ensem¬
ble was to render a medley of Phil¬
ippine native tunes. Then the
speeches were to follow Imme¬
diately after them, and as the
"rousing finale,”
two couples,
dressed a la Balintawak, were to
go into the routine of the Rigodon
Surtido.
Rehearsals began days before
the day Hours were spent at a
time, polishing off respective parts.
Everything was to be just so. Re¬
servations for the dinner-dance
were selling briskly, very much
after the fashion of the well-known
hot cakes.


High Commissioner Murphy, photo¬
graphed during the banquet given in his
honor by friends in Hollywood. Marsha
Hunt, actress, appears in the nhoto.
My paisanos sought their best
girls for the "Lady of the Even¬
ing” role, for that night.
Everything
Came the day.
went as expected, and better in
spots. The crowd was jovial, ele¬
gant, and tremendous Two or¬
chestras played The beautiful
mammoth-sized Aztec Ballroom,
which is the entire 32nd floor of
the Union Trust Building, was
packed solid.
That was about three years ago.
That night the two charming
young ladies who danced the sur¬
tido with their partners were ac¬
c'aimed. Murphy himself ap-
plauded vigorously as the four lithe
dancers went through their flirt-
atious paces The young ladies
were dressed in the colorful and
multi-hued costumes of the Balin¬
tawak, even to the last detail:
the wooden slippers. This last ac-
cessory set the g.-g. and his party
a wondering... amazed, that’s how
they were! How in the world could
those two young ladies do all those
tricky steps without losing their
footwear—or balance?
Well, in three short years, a lot
of water can flow under that old
bridge ! The two young ladies
were the Misses Kalaw, of the Ma¬


miana’s mother gave. If the child
coughed, or appeared sick, the mo¬
ther would feel elated and say:
“That is better, more people will
pity you and will give us more mo¬
ney.”
It Works
As stated, this begging system
works. Damiana reveals to us that
some time before last Christmias,
she brought home one evening
something like "5.00. A child of
twelve earning about P5 in one day
would seem unbelievable, but that
is a fact. And Damiana was not
lying, for when we helped count
her day’s earnings—and that was
an unusually poor day, we under¬
stand—she had P0.86 already in her
little bag. The day before, she


brought home P1.13. On Fridays.
when Quiapo is crowded with
church-goers from all over the city
and near-by provinces, she makes
as much as P3.40 a day. Ladies who
ride in automobiles, she confessed,
give no less than a peseta or a ten¬
centavo piece.
Begging, under certain circum¬
stances and for deserving ones;
would seer permissible. But cer¬
tainly not in the case of Damiana.
Not Poor
Investigations conducted by thic
writer revealed the following: That
Damiana’s mother plays panguin¬
gue with the money her daughter
filches from a credulous public:

LIKE THIS
CLEANSING
CREAM
... and Dentists
Recommend It Too!


Dentists recommend Kolynos
because of its antiseptic
cleansing properties. It in¬
stantly destroys the dangerous
mouth germs that cause pain
and decay. It cleans every
tooth surface, every tiny crev-
ice. And keeps teeth white,
clearand sound as no ordinary


tooth paste can.
Have your children use
Kolynos morning and night.
Just a half-inch on a dry
brush is enough. It tastes
good, protects the delicate
gums and enamel and keeps
the entire mouth sweet, clean
and refreshed.

Y E all remember still, I sup-
Wpose, the singular beauty of
the summer when the war
broke out. I was then schoolmaster
in a village on the Thames. Nearly
fifty, with a game shoulder and ex¬
tremely deficient sight, there was
no question of my fitness for milit¬
ary service, and this, as with many
other sensitive people, induced in
me, I suppose, a mood abnormally
receptive The perfect weather,
that glowing countryside, with corn
harvest just beginning, and the ap-
ples already ripening, the quiet
nights trembling with moonlight
and shadow and, in it all, this
great horror launched and grow¬
ing, the weazening of Europe de¬
liberately undertaken, the death-
warrant of millions of young men
signed. Such summer loveliness
walking hand in hand with murder
thus magnified beyond conception
was too piercingly ironical!
One of those evenings toward the
end of August, when the news of
Mons was coming through, I left
my house at the end of the village
street, and walked up towards the
Downs. I have never known any¬


thing more entrancing than the
beauty of that night All was still,
and colored like the bloom of dark
grapes, so warm, so tremulous. A
rush of stars was yielding to the
moon fast riding up, and from the
corn-stooks of that early harvest
the shadows were stealing out. We
had no daylight-saving then, and it
was perhaps half-past nine when
passed two of my former scholars,
a boy and a girl, standing silently
at the edge of an old gravel pit, op
posite a beech clump They looked
up and gave me good evening. Pass¬
ing on over the crest. I could see
the unhedged fields to either hand;
the corn stooked and the corn
standing, just gilded under the
moon; the swelling Downs of a
blue-gray; and the beech clump I
had passed, dark-cut against the
brightening sky The moon itself
was almost golden, as if it would
be warm to the touch, and from it
came a rain of giamour over sky
and fields, woods, downs, farm¬
houses, and the river down below.
All seemed in a conspiracy of un¬
reality to one obsessed, like me, by
visions of the stark and trampling

cracks and crevices. Crawling
insects touch it and die!

carnage going on out there. Re-
fuging from that grim comparison
remember thinking that Joe
Beckett and Betty Roofe were ab¬
surdly young to be sweethearting,
if indeed they were, for they hadn’t
altogether looked like it. They
could hardly be sixteen yet, for they
had only left school last year.
Betty Roofe had been head of the
girls,—an interesting child, alert,
self-contained, with a well-shaped
dark-eyed little face, and a head set
on very straight. She was the
daughter of the village laundress,
and I used to think too good for
washing clothes, but she was al¬
ready at it and as things went in
that village, would probably go on
doing it till she married. Joe
Beckett was working on Carver’s
farm down there below me, and the
gravel pit was about half away be¬
tween their homes A good boy.
Joe, freckled, reddish in the hair,
and rather too small in the head;
with blue eyes that looked at you
very straight and a short nose; a
well-grown boy, very big for his
age, and impulsive in spite of the
careful stodginess of all young
rustics; a curious vein of the sen¬
sitive in him, but a great deal of
obstinacy too,—altogether an in¬
teresting blend!
I was still standing there when
up he came on his way to Carver’s
and I look back to that next mo¬


ment with as much regret as to any
in my life
He held out his hand.
“Good-bye, sir, in case I don’t see
you again.
"Why, where are you off to,
Joe?”
"Joinin' up."
Joining up? But, my dear boy,
you’re two years under age, at
least."
He grinned. “I’m sixteen this
month, but I bet I can make out to
be eighteen. They ain’t particular,
Im told."
looked him up and down. It
was true, he could pass for eighteen
well enough, with military needs
what they were. And possessed, as
everyone was just then, by patrio¬
tism and anxiety at the news, all I
said was:
"I don’t think you ought, Joe;
but I admire your spirit."
He stood there silent, sheepish at
my words Then:
“Well, good-bye, sir I’m goin
in to —ford tomorrow"
I gave his hand a good hard
squeeze. He grinned again, and
without looking back, ran off down
the hill towards Carver’s farm.
leaving me alone once more with
the unearthly glamour of that
night. God! what a crime was war!
From this hushed moonlit peace
boys were hurrying off to that busi¬

day. Proof:
Two hundred and seventeen
miles....on one imperial gallon of
ordinary gasoline! Twenty six
miles on a pint.
Sensational as it is to the public.
who are beginning to grasp the en¬
ormous possibilities of the new
Pogue carburetor, this revolution¬
ary device has recently been given
every possible test on the road by
prominent automotive experts in
Winnipeg (Canada), and they all
admit that they have been stagger¬
ed by the results.—Herb C. Braund.
This ought to help athletics in
the Philippines:
The most convincing items of
testimony .... in support of the case
for the properly coached competi¬
tor, comes from Japan. Japan’s
earlier appearances in international
athletic competition, especially in
the Olympic games, was featured
by an intensive study of the me¬
thods of the contestants. Motion
pictures were studied and the
American methods imitated with
the religious patience and thorough-
ness apparently inherent in the
Japanese. However, the carbon


copies made in Japan of American
methods didn’t perform well. Then
the Japanese turned to study of
American coaching methods and
things began to happen.
One of the pioneer Japanese
Olympic Games contestants, after
sessions with American coaches,
was hit with the idea that the
Japanese, because of squatting in¬
stead of sitting, developed leg mus¬
cles in a way different from the
Americans. Working from this
start he altered the jumping me¬
thods of the Japanese track athle¬
tes. The result was that in the
1932 Olympics a new running hop,
step and jump record of 51 ft.,
in. was made by Chuhei Nambu of
Japan. In the same Olympic Games
the Japanese switch to study of
American coaching rather than
American performing was reflected
by Nipponese victories in the 100
meters breastroke swimming events.
In all of these events except the
100 meters backstroke the Japs set
new Olympic records.—Herb Graf¬
fis in Esquire.

remacy.—Jimmy Powers and F.

America’s points in track was piled
up by Negroes Owen, Johnson, Met-

only to the U. S. in swimming.)
The New Yorker, sophisticated
New York weekly, reported this:
A young matron we know was
being checked up by her obstetri¬
cian about a month before she ex¬
pected to be confined, and asked
him if he could tell whether the
baby would be a boy or a girl. He
said he was sorry, but she was ask-
ing more than science could do;
said he could only assure her that
it wouldn’t be twins. As she was
leaving the office, the nurse who
had been in attendance nudged her
slyly and motioned her into ano¬
ther room. “Give me your wed-
ding ring and lie down on the
floor," she said. The patient did
this, considerably surprised, but
supposing that the nurses knew
what they were doing. The nurse
then tied the wedding ring to a
piece of string and dangled it over
the prostrate patient; it swung
round in a circle, clockwise. “It
will be a boy,” the nurse said. That’s
all there is to the story, except
that the lady got up off the floor
and went home, and a month later
gave birth to a boy.

fears that another world war is in
the offing. If only everyone who
is in a position to avert war will
keep the following in mind:
“If you have the heart, step back
to the field hospital. Trucks rum¬
ble in with the wounded, but shell-
torn roads jerk the last bit of life
out of many and the stone-dead roll
in with the near-dead. The wound-
ed are taken inside. In that atmos-
phere of extreme hurry, the reek of
disinfectant and gangrene floats
above the groans that forever rise
and ebb. Never mind how cal¬
loused, you feel something in you
give way at the sight of rows upon
rows of white cots. Few men move.
Each one moans. Each begs to be
told the truth. ‘Nurse, will I see
again?' ‘Sure, you'll see again,
buddy. We’ve only bandaged your
eyes.” But that fellow is blinded
for life, and the nurse knows it
Your fist clenches when she tells
you this.
“On the operating table you look
at a fellow’s chest which resem¬
bles freshly chopped hamburger,
besmeared with crimson. But the
victim still breathes and you are
amazed at the amount of abuse the
body will stand. They’ll give him
morphine to ease the pain, although
there is no chance of his pulling
through. Then they’ll bury him,
shell fragment and all.”—C. H.


THAT GLORIOUS
BABY SMILE........
Try to keep on your children’s lips
that glorious smile which is the
best proof of sound health. Help
his gnowing body to develop norm¬
ally, his lungs to be protected
against pulmonary infections, his
digestive system to work regularly
and the dear little one will smile
happily. The easiest way to help
him as he deserves, is to give him
twice a day BOIE'S EMULSION.
This wonderful tonic will provide
his growing body with every Vita¬
min the child may need to deve¬
lop healthily and normally.

“Auto Desk” Holds Map
Before Driver


The “auto desh” fastened to the steer¬
ing post appears above.


Fastened to the steering post, an
"auto desk” is handy for keeping
road maps, shopping notes, sales
routes and other memoranda before
the motorist’s eyes. It will hold me¬
mo pads up to an inch thick, and
its strong clamp can be used to hold
a package of cigarettes or a light¬
ed cigar in easy reach. At the bot¬
tom of the “desk” is a pencil hold¬
er. When touring, a map open for
the immediate region can be mount¬
ed on the “desk" and turned as the
trip progresses

Locust Used As Fertilizer
At last a use has been found for
locusts. In Argentina large quanti¬
ties of the pests are converted into
fertilizer. When in the hoppel
stage, locusts are caught by build¬
ing long barriers of sheet-iron
Hood in The Horrors of Modern
War.
And after war, here is the pic¬
ture:
“The war chapter by no means
ends on the battlefield. For two
million formerly vigorous males a
lingering death goes on every day.
Visit veteran hospitals and sit a
moment with the tubercular, and
those with lungs partially scorched.
Each is dying a slow, mocking
death. Each who caught the blis¬
tering fire of shrapnel and gren¬
ade lies abed—twenty years after
—with vertebrae that refuse to
heal. Notice how some are nour¬
ished by injections. Observe the
snug-fitting masks on faces other-
wise so hideously scarred that even
nurses have nightmares. These are
the "lost battalions” that the public
is prohibited from viewing.
"Ask to see the ‘basket cases’—
men with legs and arms amputat¬
ed who must be wheeled and fed
and humored. Ask to see the blind-
ed; the neurasthenic and psycha¬
esthenic derelicts. Listen to their
hallucinations. Visit the forbidden
machine shop.” A maze of wires
and pulleys support a thigh, a chest,
a pelvis that was pounded by fly-
ing steel twenty years ago. To all,
life clings stubbornly. Casts and
bandages are changed year after
year to the tune—in the United
States alone—of $39,000,000 annu¬
ally.”—C. H. Hood in The Horrors
of Modern War.


plates too high for the pests to hop
over. They fall into trenches from
which they are gathered, dried, sent
to grinding plants and made into
fertilizer meal. In South Africa
where locusts last year virtually
stopped trains, cars carrying tanks
of poisonous liquid are being run
over the roads and the poison is
pumped over the entire right of
way. Experiments also have been
tried with flame-throwing appara¬
tus.

Adjustable Support Aids In
Replacing Crankcase


Tha shetches above show the ad¬
justable support described below.
The usual difficult job of re¬
placing a crankcase single-handed is
greatly simplified with this adjust-
able support, which is made from
an old valve and a length of pipe.
A cap on the upper end of the pipe
is drilled for the valve stem and is
tapped at one side through the pipe
for a thumbscrew, after which the
assembly is mounted on a wood base
by means of a floor flange. In use,
the valve, which has a spring under


the head, is pushed down to com¬
press the spring where it is held
with the thumbscrew. The tool is
slid under the motor and the valve
released to hold the crankcase in
place until the screws can be
started. Small blocks placed under
the base will adjust the tool for
height.

N November 25, 1898, a young.
Bavarian-born American hos-
pital steward attached to the
hospital corps of the United States
army landed in Manila with a job
but with nothing except a little
cash in his pocket. He was not
certain about what he would do
here or how long he would stay in
the Philippines after the war.
The war it appeared at the time
he landed here, was practically al¬
ready won and the campaign
against the Filipinos was so suc¬
cessful that the officers in com-
mand thought it would not
require much more time.
There were many who were
already thinking of going
home. But the Bavarian¬
born Americano liked ad¬
venture; he was equipped
personally with a good deal
of energy and an eager¬
ness to live life fully and
fruitfully So he stayed in
this country which bade
fair to give much to men
like him.
And he was justified.
To-day, that same young
man is the president (prac-
tically the owner, because
his only partners are his
wife and their two chil¬
dren) of one of the big¬
gest transportation com¬
panies north of Manila, an
enterprise which is conser¬
vatively estimated to be
worth between P800,000 and
₱1,000,000 That ex-hos¬
pital steward and now
transportation magnate is
Frank Klar, an American
who long ago adopted the
Philippines as his home¬
land.
Mr Frank Klar was
born in Neustadt a/d
Haardt, Bavaria, Germany,
on February 20, 1868. He
is the eldest of the two
children of Joseph Klar
and Christine Kopp.
Joseph Klar, a house
painter and decorator had
some troubles with the government
for expressing his opinion too
frankly about the emperor of Ger¬
many and so decided to forsake
the fatherland for America, the
land of the free..
He worked in New York City
and after saving a little money, he
sent for his wife and his two child
ren. At the age of 12, therefore.
Frank Klar crossed the Atlantic
and joined his father in New York
City.
Soon after they settled down in
New York, young Frank went to
work in a lamp wick factory, earn
ing $1.50 a week. The pay was
much too small, but young Frank
was fast learning the value of in-


dustry and hard work, which know¬
ledge was later to prove more use¬
ful to him.
After leaving the lamp wick fac-
tory, Klar drifted from one work to
another. He worked as apprentice
cigar-maker in New York, and la¬
ter worked in an engraving plant.
He became quite proficient in this.
so that when he left home to lead
an independent existence, he was
able to find jobs wherever he went.
He worked in engraving shops in
Memphis, Tenn., in Albany, N. Y..
and in New Orleans.


Mr. Frank Klar
President, Pangasinan Transportation Co


Four times, he tried to enlist in
the United States Army; and four
times, his application was turned
down. Finally, in June, 1889 he
was accepted at Fort Houston. Te¬
xas, and assigned to Company C.,
15th Infantry. After fifteen months
as buck private, he was transfer¬
red to the hospital corps. In two
years’ time, he completed all re¬
quisites for the position of hospital
steward and was promoted to that
rank. He had served four years as
such when the Spanish-American
war that was to lead him to the
Philippines broke out. He landed
in Manila with the hospital corps
on November 25, 1898. He has
been here since then, and has ne¬


ver gone past Corregidor in the last
38 years.
He stayed in Cavite for two
weeks, and was later assigned to
Toilo. He stayed in that port for
six years, and it was there where
he was honorably discharged on
June 24, 1901. He engaged in
the carpentry business, and later
took and passed the first grade ci¬
vil service examination.
Frank Klar became subsequently
clerk in the provincial treasurer’s
office in Iloilo and later, in the
bureau of internal revenue. He re¬
signed in 1905 from the
government service, but in
1906, he accepted another
job in the office of the
provincial treasurer of Ba¬
colod.
Subsequently he became
chief clerk in the office of
the provincial treasurer of
In
Ambos Camarines
1907, he became acting
treasurer of the province
He was provincial treasuren
of Leyte for five years.
From 1913 to 1914, he
was connected with the
executive bureau
Still
later, he became provincial
treasurer of Cotabato. In
1917, he retired and re¬
turned to Manila, a sick
man.
In 1918, just after leav.
ing the sickbed, he was
offered a job with the
Pangasinan Transportation
Company by L. A. Ammen,
and he accepted the offer.
The company became a de-
cided success under his
management, and in 1925
the entire business passed
into his hands.
The company to-day ope¬
rates 112 passenger trucks
and 18 service cars. It has
about 400 employees All
of whom are Filipinos,
with the exception of the
shop superintendent.
Mr Klar is married to
Milagros Vasquez of Iloilo
and has only two children: Jose
Luis and Cristina, now Mrs Ra¬
fael Gonzales. Jose Luis Klar has
been manager of the Pantranco
since 1925.

We followed an impulse we had
always succeeded in defeating in
the past and stole a few minutes
from our “beat" to visit the Ma¬
nila Stock Exchange and the Crys¬
tal Arcade stock offices the other
day.
We capped the brief adventure
with a glass of beer at the Ex¬
change Bar behind the Crystal
Arcade.
In the brief time we were inside
that bar, we saw more money—in
checks and cash—changing hands
than the whole day we stayed in
the office of the municipal trea¬
surer 'way back home last May,
when we paid our taxes.

The biggest confirmed stories
circulating around the Stock Ex¬
change were told to us by a re¬
tired, rich, business man.
An American bought mining
stocks in the morning, sold all of
them in the afternoon, and carried
home P40,000 in profits
A drug store clerk left his office
one morning without the permis¬
sion of his boss, returned from the
exchange a few minutes before
twelve o’clock with P16,000

F you're a housewife bothered
about magazines and things
A that clutter up your house
but can’t be thrown away
because they contain some article
or picture that you want to keep
or remember, why don’t you make
a scrapbook?
I used to keep loads and piles of
old newspapers and magazines be¬
cause they contained interesting
items that I didn’t want to lose.
They became quite a problem af¬
ter some time because whenever I
intended to do some general house
cleaning I’d spend the greater por¬
tion of my time sorting out period¬
icals and looking through them to
be sure I was not throwing away
something I wanted to keep. Very
often I ended up by not doing as


thorough a cleaning job as I in¬
tended because I had lost so much
time already and I had to see about
supper yet or attend to some other
task.
Then once I gave myself a whole
day to do with as I pleased. I
browsed to my heart’s content over
old newspapers and magazines—
but with a purpose. I had a pair
of scissors in hand. Every time I
came upon something I wanted to
keep, I cut it out. Many times I
found myself in a quandary as when
an article ran over to the back of
the page. This was especially dif-
ficult when it came to pictures. In
the end I simply decided I did not
want whatever it was that I had
to sacrifice.
Believe it or not the clipping
alone took me a whole day and I had

a sore back when it was over. I put
all my clippings in a big shirt box
and forgot all about them until one
Sunday a couple of weeks later.
Armed with a pair of scissors for
trimming, a large scrapbook of
Manila paper and a jar of paste, I
sat down on the floor again and
had a grand time pasting my clip¬
pings under the sections they be¬
longed to. Oh, yes, I forgot to tell
you that I divided my scrapbook
into sections: one for menus and
recipes, one for interior decora¬
tion, one for beauty, one for ba¬
bies, one for house plans and gar¬
dening, etc. The illustrations were
lavish as in fact there were more
pictures than print. By evening I


had a scrapbook to be proud of.
My scrapbook is about the best
thing for my purpose that I can
imagine. I had rolls of thick Ma¬
nila paper trimmed into strips 32
inches by 12 inches, I folded each
strip across to form two leaves and
then folded the leaves back one
inch from the center fold creating
a pleat between them. From the
sides I punched ring holes. I
placed several of these twin leaves
between the cardboard covers, ran
rings thru the holes and that was
that. I can take out any leaf
from any section or add to them
and I’m never afraid that leaves
of my scrapbook can get out of
stock.


RECIPES


GRIDDLE CAKES—Sift three
cups flour, one teaspoon salt, four
teaspoons baking powder and two
tablespoons sugar together. Add to
these two cups milk, a well beaten
egg, and two tablespoons melted
shortening. Cook on a greased
griddle.
EGG NESTS—Separate e g g s.
Beat whites stiff—adding pepper
and salt. Pile on rounds of toast,
make depression in center and slip
egg yolk in. Bake in moderate
oven until yolks are set and whites
are golden brown.
BANANA AND FRUIT JUICE
—Slice bananas. Mig orange juice
and pineapple juice together in
equal proportions. Pour over ba¬
manas. Chal and serve.
Papaya Salad
A most delicious salad can be
made out of green papayas. Peel
one large or two small green papa¬
yas and shred. Boil until tender.
Cool the papaya and arrange nar¬
row strips on individual plates.


These may be attractively adorned
by shaving a bit of the fruit fine,
mixing with several tablespoons of
chopped nuts and grated cheese,
and then pile well with dressing.
A little salt adds to the flavor, and
pimentos or celery seed also can
be used to garnish.
Cabbage Salad
Beat the yolks of three eggs
with half a teaspoonful of must¬
ard mired for the table, two table¬
spoonfuls of butter, then gradually.
five tablespoonfuls of hot vinegar.
Stir and cook over hot water until
the mirture is thick and smooth.
Just before using, mir with crip,
finely shredded cabbage. The cen¬
tre of a head of cabbage may be
cut out and shredded and the shell
used as a bowl from which the sa¬
lad is served. The cabbage bowl
may stand on a hot napkin hold¬
ing hot, fried oysters. If the cab¬
bage bowl is chilled, the heat of the
napkin will not reach the salad.

the dwelling.
The windows of the first floor are
provided with projecting iron grilles, the
projection being necessary to permit side
views from the windows. A bay window is
provided for the dining room and one of
the bedrooms on the first floor, a feature
that lends itself to more artistic interior
decoration. One of the bedrooms on the
first floor may be utilized as a library. The
other bedroom can be a handy guest room.
A boudoir for the lady of the house
has been provided on the second floor,
very convenient for the wife who once a
day may want to retire to this place for
repose. The boudoir she may also utilize
as a place in which to meet and entertain
women friends when they drop in. The
porch on this floor will be very ideal for
the deb of the family on moonlit nights
and useful to other members of the house¬
hold during sultry evenings.
The house has a ground area of 94
square meters and will cost between P7,500
and P3,500 if constructed of wood, con¬
crete galvanized iron, and adobe stones.
For particulars concerning this house
plan, please communicate with  
or with A. B. Villalon, 183 Solis, Tondo.

Takes Exception
I take exception to that part of
your article entitled “Manila’s Eat¬
ing Places and Markets" (GRAPH-
IC dated August 6, 1936) wherein
your reporter in his enthusiasm
perhaps to paint a lurid picture has
mistakenly included, as among Ma¬
nila’s dirty eating places, Mr. Lu
Sia’s combination "siopao-pancit¬
mami" carinderia on Villalobos
Street, Manila. Immediately after
the publication of said article, I
went to his place with some health
officials and these officials will
testify that no such state of things,
as written to him, existed therein.
Dr. Intengan of the Bureau of
Health whom we consulted over the
matter, informed us that the wear¬
ing of aprons is voluntary on the
part of the store-owners and is not
required by the Philippine Health
Service.

the article on Manila’s eating
places came out several ca¬
rinderias and panciterias have
shown a remarkably improved

Great Injustice
Sentencing the Asedillo-Encallado
bandits from 30 to 210 years each
is a great injustice, because the
long prison terms can only mean
that they will die prisoners. They
are thus deprived of the chance to
become law-abiding citizens outside
the prison. Keeping convicts in¬
side prisons is not the modern way

A City Just The Same
You said you have found out
(August 6th  , page 1)
that there are only three cities in
the country, and that Iloilo and
Cebu are not. Cebu may not be a
city, but it is so in all respects: in¬

whether yow call it town or city,
Filipinos will continue calling it a

Battalion Sponsors
Our school (Bukidnon Normal
School) has a battalion of three
companies drilling twice a week.
When it rains the battalion hears
military lectures and tactical de¬

But I am puzzled about this talk
about having military sponsors.
Must school cadet corps necessarily
have them, I wonder?

A Forest Rendezvous
THEY said someone was waiting;
And at the trysting oak
Sudden enchanting voices
Leaf-lightly spoke.
Daylong she had been coming,
And all the forest sang
Of beauty: elfin-softly
The bluebells rang.
Nightlong she was in shadow,
She who went away
As the moon does in the silver
Veils of day.
I see no course to follow,
Alas, nor where to find
The silver way she vanished,
Being blind.
I, Who Fade With The Lilacs
I, who fade with the lilacs
And with the roses fade,
Am sharing this hour with them
Conferring in the shade.
Life has not left the wonder
With which it first began
To make Pierrot a poet,
In making him a man.
It has not made a rainbow,
In all the sorry years,
But was a sailing glory
Upon a sea of tears.
Somehow life leaves one stranded
On shores too near or far,
Hitching, forever hitching
Ships—shallops to a star.

THE STORY OF A CHILD
Continued from page 23
that the mother, although really
without the support of a husband,
can still undertake laundry jobs
like other women of her age; that
the mother has brothers and rela¬
tives in a Batangas town who can
very well afford to rear them and
that the husband ieft a small pro¬
perty in the province. The family,
the girl confessed, is not really as
poor as the mother wants people to
believe. She often sees her mother,
she said, counting their money. She
could not say how much her mother
had but she said, "there were heaps
of them" in peso bills, and in coins
of tens, twenties, and fifties.
Why does Damiana’s mother stick
to the city, when she had been ask¬
ed by her brothers a number of
times, according to Damiana her¬
self, to go to Batangas and live on
the farm? Why does she dress her
daughter and son in rags and make
them undergo the tortures of walk¬
ing the streets of the city, regard
less of the rain er the heat of the
sun?
The answer is in that heap of
money which Damiana often sees
her mother counting.
Other Cases
Mrs. Asuncion A. Perez, execu¬
tive secretary of the Associated
Charities, when told of the case of
Damiana, cited a number of iden¬
tical cases. Despite the limited
funds available, Mrs. Perez said,
some of them would be sent to
school. A report of the Associated
Charities state: “Children of dif-
ferent ages play a very active part
in the craft. Children of school
age are employed as guides and the
like. Infants, especially sickly
ones, are borrowed or rented.
An investigator of that office
revealed a number of cases which
are worth recording. The first case
is that of a woman who, feigning
sorrow, came to the office one day
and related the death of her child.
She was given funeral aid by the
office, but the following day, she
was seen carrying a new child—of
the same age as the first who died
—begging and asking alms in be¬
half of the child.
There is also the case of Leono¬
ra de los Reyes, 25, of 5 Kolambu,
Tondo. She is a widow has four
children whom she employs in the
business. Every day, she sends Mi¬
lagros, 10, with her youngest child
(a year old) to Quiapo to beg with
memorized verses. Jose, twelve, is
sent to the Escolta every day: and
the fourth, to various districts of
Manila, but frequently Santa Cruz.
Most of the time, the healthy mo¬
ther stays behind her daughter Mi¬
lagros and watches. She comes out
of hiding to punish Milagros every
time the child stops reciting her
memorized verses.
There are numerous other cases,
ranging from the case of Francisco
Ramos of 14 Malong, Tondo, who
owns a number of houses for rent.
and the one whe owns a gambling


house for beggars at Solana street,
Intramuros.
All these cases show that not all
beggars are deserving of public
pity

ness of man-made death as if there
were not Nature’s deaths galore to
fight against. And we,—we could
on'y admire them for it! Well! 1
have never ceased to curse the sen¬
timent which stopped me from in-
forming the recruiting authorities
of that boy’s real age.
Crossing back over the crest of
the hill towards home, I came on
the child Betty, at the edge of the
gravel pit where I had left her.
“Well, Betty, was Joe telling
you?
“Yes, sir. He’s going to join
up.
"What did you say to him?”
“I said he was a fool, but he’s
so headstrong, Joe!” Her voice was
even enough, but she was quiver¬
ing all over.
"It’s very plucky of him, Betty.”
“M’m! Joe just gets things into
his head. I don’t see that he has
any call to go, and,—and leave me.
I couldn’t help a smile. She saw

to apply. The metal-shaft of
the brush holds the soft hairs

it, and said sullenly:
“Yes, I’m young, and so’s Joe;
but he’s my boy, for all that!"
And then, ashamed or startled at
such expansivenesst she tossed her
nead, swerved into the beech clump
like a shying foal, and ran off
among the trees. I stood a few
minutes, listening to the owls, then
went home and read myself into
forgetfulness on Scott’s first polar
book.
So Joe went, and we knew him
no more for a whole year. And
Betty continued with her mother,
washing for the village.
IN September, 1915, just after
1 term had begun again, I was
standing one afternoon in the vil¬
lage schoolroom pinning up on the
wall a pictorial piece of imperial
information for the benefit of my
scholars, and thinking, as usual, of
the war and its lingering deadlock.
The sunlight slanted through on to
my dusty forms and desks, and un¬
der the pollard lime trees on the
far side of the street I could see a
so'dier standing with a girl. Sud¬
denly he crossed over to the school,
and there in the doorway was
young Joe Beckett, in his absurd
short-tailed khaki jacket, square
and tanned to the color of his frec-
kles, looking indeed quite a man.

“How d'you do, sir?”
“And you, Joe?
“Oh! I’m fine. I thought I’d like
to see you. Just got our marching
orders Off to France to-morrow,
been havin’ my leave."
I felt the catch at my throat that
we all felt when youngsters whom
we knew were going out for the
first time.
"Was that Betty with you out
there?
“Yes,—fact is, I’ve got something
to tell you, sir. She and I were
spliced last week at —mouth. We
been stayin’ there since, and I
brought her home to-day, as I got
to go to-night."
I was staring hard, and he went
on hurriedly
“She just went off there, and I
joined her for my leave. We didn’t
want any fuss, you see, because of
our bein’ too young.
"Young!"
The blankness of my tone took
the grin off his face.
“Well, I was seventeen a week
ago, and she’ll be seventeen next
month."
“Married? Honest Injun, Joe?”
He went to the door, and
whistled. In came Betty, dressed
in dark blue, very neat, and self¬
contained; only the flush on her
round young face marked any dis¬
turbance
“Show him your lines, Betty, and
your ring.
The girl held out the official
slip, and from it I read that a reg¬
istrar had married them at —mouth,
under right names and wrong ages.
Then she slipped a glove off, and
held up her left hand,—there was
the magic hoop! Well! the folly was
committed,—no use in crabbing it!
“Very good of you to tell me,
Joe,” I said, at last. "Am I the
first to know?”
“Yes, sir. You see, I’ve got to
go at once; and like as not her
mother won’t want it to get about
till she’s a bit older. I thought I’d
like to tell you, in case they said
it wasn’t all straight and proper."
"Nothing I say will alter the fact
that you've falsified your ages."
Joe grinned again
“That’s all right,” he said. "I
got it from a lawyer’s clerk in my
platoon. It’s a marriage all the
same."
“Yes, I believe that’s so.
“Well, sir, there she is till I come
back.” Suddenly, his face changed,
he looked for all the world as if he
were going to cry; and they stood
gazing at each other as if they were
alone
The lodger at the carpenter’s,
three doors down the street, was
performing her usual afternoon so¬
lo on the piano: “Connais-tu le
pays?” from Mignon. And when¬
ever I hear it now, seldom enough
in days contemptuous of harmony,
it brings Joe and Betty back
through a broad sunbeam full of
dancing motes of dust: it epitom¬
ises for me all the Drang,—as the
Germans call it,—of those horrible
years, when marriage, birth, death.

all that an enlightened humanity
should not be doing, and left un¬
done most of what it should have
done.
"What time is it, sir?” Joe asked
me suddenly.
"Five o’clock.”
“Lord! I must run for it. My
kit’s at the station. Could I leave
her here, sir?
I nodded, and walked into the
little room beyond. When I came
back she was sitting where she
used to sit in school, bowed over
her arms spread out on the inky
desk. Her dark bobbed hair was
all I could see, and the quivering
jerky movement of her young
shoulders. Joe had gone. Well!
That was the normal state of Eu¬
rope, then! I went back into the
little room to give her time, but
when I returned once more, she,
too, had gone.
The second winter passed, more
muddy, more bloody even than the
first, and less shot through with
hopes of an ending. Betty showed
me three or four of Joe’s letters,
simple screeds with a phrase here
and there of awkward and half-
smothered feeling, and signed al¬
ways: “Your loving hubby Joe.”
Her marriage was accepted in the
village. Child-marriage was quite
common then. In April it began to
be obvious that their union was to
be 'blessed’ as they call it.
One day early in May I was pas¬
sing Mrs. Roofe’s when I saw that
lady in her patch of garden, and
stopped to ask after Betty.
“Nearin’ her time. I’ve written
Joe Beckett. Happen he’ll get
leave."
“I think that was a mistake, Mrs.
Roofe. I would have waited till it
was over.”
“Maybe you’re right, sir, but
Betty’s that fidgety about him


not knowin' She’s dreadful young,
you know, t’ave a child. I didn’t
ave my first till I was twenty-
one."
"Everything goes fast these
days, Mrs. Roofe.”
“Not my washin. I can’t get the
help, with Betty like this. It’s a
sad business this about the baby
comin'. If he does get killed,
suppose she’ll get a pension, sir?”
Pension? Married in the wrong
age, with the baby still under ser¬
vice age, if they came to look into
it: I really didn’t know.
“Oh! surely, Mrs. Roofe, but we
can’t think about his being killed.
Joe’s a fine boy.
Mrs. Roofe’s worn face dark¬
ened.
“He was a fool to join up before
his time; plenty of chance after,
seemingly, and then to marry my
girl, like this! Well, young folks
are fools!"
I was sitting over my Pensions
work one evening, a month later,
for it had now fallen to me to keep
things listed in the village, when
someone knocked at my door, and
who should be standing there but
Joe Beckett!
“Why! Joe! Got leave?”
“Ah! I had to come and see her.
I haven’t been there yet,—didn’t
dare. How is she, sir?”
Pale and dusty, as if from a hard
journey, his uniform all muddy and
unbrushed, and his reddish hair
standing up anyhow,—he looked
wretched, poor boy!
“She’s all right, Joe. But it
must be very near, from what her
mother says."
“I haven’t had any sleep for
nights, thinking of her,—such a
kid, she is!"
“Does she know you’re coming?”
"No, I haven’t said nothing.
“Better be careful. I wouldn’t
risk a shock. Have you anywhere
to sleep?
“No, sir.
“Well, you can stay here, if you
like. They won’t have room for


QUESTION: — A bought the
house of B. But A cannot pay it
in cash so they made a written
contract that he (A) will pay the
whole obligation at a certain date.
In the contract it is stated that B
can take back the house without
refunding the first payment to A.
Supposing A fails to meet the obli¬
gation, can B lawfully take back
the house without refunding the
first payment?—Isidro R. Tecson,
Baliwag, Bulacan.
ANSWER: —B is entitled to res¬
cind the contract by taking back
house and retaining the first
payment because it was the agree
ment of the parties and the same
is in accordance with law (See
Articles 1454 in connection with
Section 1255 of the Civil Code.)
The mere fact that the instrument
did not become a public document
does not militate against the right
of B because said instrument is
valid and binding between the
parties in accordance with Sec¬
tion 335 of the Code of Civil Pro¬
cedure and Civil Code.—Answer

QUESTIONS:—I have always
tried to keep the color of a new
cloth after washing, but I find it
impossible. Cotton as well as wools
would fade after three or four
washings How can I maintain the
color of a cloth? What is the best
chemical that would keep the color
of the cloth from fading?—Mrs.


Consuelo Z. Bayani, Tankulan, Bu¬
kidnon.
ANSWERS:—Soak the material
overnight in either salted or vine¬
gar water. Salt for orange colors
and reds, vinegar for lavender,
blue and other receding colors.
The proportion would be a hand¬
ful or two of salt to a basin of
water and one part strong vinegan
to three of water.
There are, however, two main
reasons why colors fade. Either
the dyeing is inferior or the wash¬
ing is faulty. Buy only good qua¬
lity material and in washing print¬
ed or colored goods take care not
to dry them in strong sunlight.

ANSWERS:—The 3% pension
deposits of a municipal teacher
who has been granted gratuity
under the provisions of Acts 2589

away from me.
“Thank ye, sir, I wouldn’t like
to put you out.
“Not a bit, Joe. Delighted to
have you, and hear your adven¬
tures."
He shook his head. "I don’t
want to talk of them,” he said
darkly "Don’t you think I could
see 'er to-night, sir? I’ve come a
long way for it, my God! I have!”
“Well, try! But see her mother
first.

forehead. His face, so young a
face, already had that look in the

QUESTIONS:—What causes
pemphigus in a baby less than a
week old? Is it apt to recur? Is
it contagious? If so, how? Is it
similar to or can it be caused by
impetigo?—An Inquirer, Manila.
ANSWERS:—Pemphigus of the
new born is a form of impetigo. It
is a superficial pustular condition
of the skin which often spreads
rapidly because the germ, a form
of staphylococcus, escapes with the
pus when the blisters break. If
all the infant’s clothing is not
boiled and if the germ is not killed
by the local application of the pro¬
per treatment, new spots soon ap¬
pear. When impetigo occurs in the
older infants and children, it often
takes the form of adherent crusts
which usually persist for weeks; if
the scabs are nof completely re¬
moved before the proper treatment
is applied and the underwear boil¬
ed, new spots usually appear. The
disease may be passed on from one
child to another if proper precau¬
tions are not taken to destroy the
germ that causes its spread.—

QUESTION: Earache is doing
me a lot of trouble. How can 
prevent this condition?—A GRA-
PHIC reader, Manila.
ANSWER:—Inflammation of
the middle ear is probably the
commonest cause of earache,


though there are of course other
causes of this distressing symp-
tom, such as enlarged or inflamed
tonsils, the presence of adenoids.
the plugging up of the Eustachian
tubes with mucus, the presence
of hard wax against the ear-drum,
and severe head cold. Earache.
unless it responds promptly and
completely to single measures, is
a condition which should be seon
by a physician.
Simple measures which are fre¬
quently of great value in cases
of earache comprise the limiting
of the diet to orange juice and
water, the taking of a hot enema
once or twice a day, irradiation
of the ear with ultra-violet rays,
the use of hot water bottle to the
ear or a hot sand bag or hot water
bag. Sometimes irrigating the ear
with warm water is of value or the
dropping into the canal of the ear
of warm olive oil. Steaming the
side of the head with vapor from
a croup kettle will often relieve
the pain. If pus is found running
from the ear, do not plug the ear
with cotton for it will keep the
pus from discharging freely and
may cause serious trouble. Some¬
times a boil or abscess will form
in the outer canal of the ear and
this will cause severe pain. Hot
applications may be used to ad¬
vantage.—From “Physical Cul¬
ture."


"I know sir,"
he muttered, “I
know. Cruel work, but I’ve got to
take him. He’ll have to go back to
France.
"What does it mean?”
He lifted his arms from his sides
and let them drop, and that ges¬
ture was somehow the most expres¬
sive and dreadful I ever saw.
“Deserting in face of the enemy,"
he whispered hoarsely. “Bad busi¬
ness! Can you get that girl away,
sir?"
But Joe himself undid the grip
of her arms, and held her from
him, bending, he kissed her hair
and face; then, with a groan, he
literally pushed her into my arms
and marched straight off between
the guard.
And I was left in the dark, sweet¬
scented street, with that distracted
child struggling in my grasp.
"Oh, My God! My God! My
God!” over and over and over. And
what could one say or do?
LL the rest of that night, after
AMrs. Roofe had got Betty back
into the cottage, I sat up writing in
duplicate the facts about Joe Bec¬


kett.
I sent one copy to his regiment-
al headquarters, the other to the
chaplain of his regiment in France.
I sent fresh copies two days later
with duplicates of his birth certi¬
ficate to make quite sure. It was
all I could do. Then came a fort¬
night of waiting for news. Betty
was still distracted. The thought
that, through her anxiety, she her¬
self had delivered him into their
hands nearly sent her off her head.
Probably her baby alone kept her
from insanity or suicide. And all
that time the battle of the Somme
raged, and hundreds of thousands
of women in England and France
and Germany were in daily terror
for their menfolk. Yet none, I
think, could have had quite the
feelings of that child. Her mother,
poor woman, would come over to
me at the schoolhouse, and asked
if I had heard anything.
“Better for the poor girl to know
the worst,” she said, "if it is the
worst. The anxiety’s killin’ 'er."
But I had no news and could not
get any at headquarters. The
(Continued on page 46)


for he was still about, but I had
little talk with him, for, though
a'ways friendly, he seemed shy of
me, and as to talking of the war,-
not a word! One evening I passed
him and Betty leaning on a gate,
close to the river,—a warm evening
of early July, when the Somme bat¬
tle was at its height. Out there
hell incarnate; and here intense
peace, the quietly flowing river, the
willows, and unstirring aspens, the
light slowly dying; and those two
young things, with their arms
round each other, and their heads
close together,—her bobbed dark
hair and Joe’s reddish mop, getting
quite long! I took good care not
to disturb them. His last night,
perhaps, before he went back into
the furnace!
It was no business of mine to
have my doubts, but I had been hav¬
ing them long before that very
dreadful night when, just as I was
going to bed, something rattled on
my window, and going down,
found Betty outside, distracted.
"Oh, sir, come quick! They've
'rested Joe.
As we went over, she told me:
“Oh, sir. I was afraid there was
some mistake about his leave,—it
was so long. I thought he’d get


into trouble over it, so I asked Bill
Paterman” (the village constable)
and now they’ve come and 'rested
him for deserting. Oh! What have
I done? What have I done?”
Outside the Roofes’ cottage, Joe
was standing between a corporal’s
guard, and Betty flung herself into
his arms. Inside, I could hear
Mrs. Roofe expostulating with the
corporal, and the baby crying. In
the sleeping quiet of the village
street, smelling of hay just har¬
vested, it was atrocious.
I spoke to Joe. He answered
quietly, in her arms:
I asked for leave, but they
wouldn’t give it. I had to come. I
couldn’t stick it, knowing how it
was with her.
“Where was your regiment?”
“In the line."
“Good God!'
Just then the corporal came out.
I took him apart.
“I was his schoolmaster, corpo¬
ral,” I said. “The poor chap joined
up when he was just sixteen,—he’s
still under age, you see,—and now
he’s got this child wife and a new¬
born baby!"
The corporal nodded. His face
was twitching, a lined, decent face
with a moustache.


ARETAMAAMAE
There seems to be no speedier way to end a headache—
and there is certainly no safer way—than two tablets of
Cafiaspirina. If you've tried it, vou know. And if you
saw Cafiaspirina made, you would know why iz is of such
uniform, dependable action. No disagreeable taste or
odor. No injurious quantities of salicylic acid to upset
the stomach. No coarse particles that won’t dissolve.
Nothing to depress the heart. So keep
these tablets handy, and keep your en¬
gagements—free from headaches, neural¬
gia, or other sudden discomfort.

The Humane One


BY FRANCISCO M. T. BARRIOS


TALSIE, I am surprised at you.
That resounding whack which
A has left red spots on your
flesh and which was quite strong
enough to lay low an ox has sent
that poor insect farther than eter¬
nity. I didn’t suspect you were as
strong as that. Why did you ever
do it? Consign a poor creature to
oblivion without a trial, without
giving him a chance to defend him¬
self. And yet, you would be an
abogado: consecrating your life to
the cause of the oppressed and the
lowly, the poor and defenseless...!
Look at what you have done, my
friend. Just a moment ago, it was


describing beautiful, artistic semi¬
parabolas in the air, free, glad to
be alive, buzzing an epic of its
tribe, circling here, circling


there... And now, where is it?
Where have you sent him? See,
you are speechless, you are dumb-
founded, you are surprised. You
don’t know!
'Twas rather rash of you, Pal¬
sie. What power on earth can now
bring back to life that dark mass
the size of a pinhead resting so
quietly on your epidermis? What
formula evolved by the genius of
mankind can again instill life into
it?
It had in its vitals your blood,
did it not? Was there then no such
a thing as consanguinity between
you two? Was it not then entit'ed
to your protection?
Of course, there might not have
been premeditation on your part.
Then, too, the insect, the poor mos¬
quito, may have bothered you a
little. But by Fu Manchu, the
means you employed to repel the
attack—if attack it may be called—
was certainly unwarranted! Yes,
you look at me as if you thought
me mad. But it boils me, it does,
the way you treated that poor, in¬
nocent mosquito! There was the
use of superior force, there was
treachery, there was—it pains me,
Palsie, how soon you have forgot¬
ten that he prayeth best who lov-
eth best, all things both great and
small, for...Ouch! Aray!

"Oh, I am so glad you have
come. Your Tio and I have been
missing you a lot. There, there,
take a chair, dear. Is it candy you
prefer, or fruits? Help yourself to
what is in the tray. Now, tell me,
could your Tio and I be of some
help to you?” Thus does Tia Cho¬
leng greet each one of us, her nieces
and nephews, whenever we call on


her. “You understand of course
that everything that your Tio and
I own is yours if you need it,” she
always adds generously.
Yes, Tia Choleng greets us with
overflowing hospitality, entertains
us with all kinds of stories and an¬
ecdotes, feeds us liberally with can¬
dies and fruits; she is indeed nice
to us, very nice. And yet...
“So your boarding house is far
from school, dear, is it? Poor
child!" she comments sympatheti¬
cally. “Of course, if you like, you
might stay with us here. That is,
of course, if you can endure our
poverty. Your Tio and I would be
very glad to have you, we are al¬
ways wi ling to help you. But also.
dear, please understand beforehand
that we do not keep regular hours
here, as with meals for instance,
whereas, it is always necessary
when students are in the house.


And I might add, too, without
meaning to include you (I know
you are a very well-behaved young
lady), that I am not very much
disposed to having young girls
placed in my care. There are dan¬
gers, you know... and if anything
should happen when they are living
with me, I would be held responsi¬
ble! But you of course, dear, should
come. Indeed, please do! We are
always ready to help you.”
That was the way she dealt with
my cousin Adela, who called on her
one time. Adela had not intended
anything more than to inform Tia
Choleng about our change of ad¬
dress, but how she was misunder-
stood was just typical of Tia Cho¬
leng. "Of course, not for anything
would I go to live with her. Oh,
no!" my cousin cried with feeling.
Not one of us, her nieces and ne¬
phews, are ever surprised now at
the way she treats us. We have
grown to realize how she really
thinks of us, and we have accord¬
ingly avoided giving her the least
bit of trouble. She treats us all
alike... that way. On some occa¬
sions she might say, "How splen¬
did of you to be graduating this
coming March, dear.” Or, "How
nice of you to be taking summer
vacation in Manila, child. Your
Tio and I are very proud of you.
I wish we could help you. I under¬
stand you will need extra money
for many things you will need. And
yet, I am afraid we would not be
able to help you. You see..." And
then would come a minutely de¬
tailed summary of their expenses,
their income, etc. The niece con¬
cerned could then do nothing but
squirm in her seat as if she really
were guitly of no less a crime than
that of having asked something
from Tia Choleng.
If she would only stop fearing or
anticipating a hold-up every time
any of her nieces and nephews are
around! If she would on’y order us
to do some kind of work when we
call on her, instead of treating us

Complete Freedom for Eovpt Promised


Demonstrations against British control in Egynt which were f requent not long ago have led to the treaty granting that country
complets freedom after a decade. Above photo shows steel-helmeted policemen of Cairo, Egypt, during these troubled davs, prepar¬
ing fe attach demonstrating students.


FrHE long years of British rule
in Egypt will end completely
I in a decade according to
the treaty signed last week in
London between the Egyptian and
English governments.
Long before Egypt became for¬
mally an English protectorate in
1914, the British had control of
Egyptian finance and defense,
naturally to the great resentment
of Egyptians. From 1914 to the
present, British control in Egypt


has been marked by constant
clashes between the controlling
power and nationalists of Egypt.
In 1919 as a result of Egyptian
agitation, England was forced to
recognize the country as an inde¬
pendent monarchy to pacify the
Egyptian nationalists. British con¬
trol, however, remained and the
Wafd (Nationalist) party compos¬
ing 90 per cent of the inhabitants
were far from being satisfied.
Agitations and disturbances have
continued, the most recent of which.


coincided with the Italian campaign
in Ethiopia. This latest demonstra¬

thing was being dealt with in
I’rance. Never was the scale and
pitch of the world’s horror more
brought home to me. This deadly
little tragedy was as nothing,—
just a fragment of straw whirling
round in that terrible wind.
And then one day I did get news.
—a letter from the chaplain, and
seeing what it was, I stuck it in my
pocket and sneaked down to the ri¬
ver—literally afraid to open it till
I was alone. Crouched up there,
with my back to a haystack, I took
it out with trembling fingers.
“Dear Sir,
The boy Joe Beckelt was shot to¬
day at dawn. I am distressed at
having to tell you and the poor
War is a cruel
child, his wife.
thing, indeed!”
I had known it. Poor Joe! Poor
Betty! Poor, poor Betty! I read
on:
“I did all I could; the facts you
sent were put before the Court
Martial and the point of his age
considered. But all leave had been
stopped; his request had been defi¬
nitely refused; the regiment was ac¬
tually in the line, with fighting go¬
ing on,—and the situation extreme¬
ly critical in that sector. Private
considerations count for nothing in
such circumstances,—the rule is
adamant. Perhaps it has to be,—I
cannot say. But I have been great¬
ly distressed by the whole thing,
and the Couri itself was much
moved. The poor boy seemed
dazed; he wouidn’t talk, didnit
seem to take in anything; indeed,
they tell me that all he said after
the verdict, certainly all I heard
him say was: ‘My poor wife! My
poor wife! over and over again.
He stood up well at the end.”


TREATY GIVING LIBERTY
AFTER A DECADE SIGNED
tion led to the London parley which
reached an agreement last week.
The principal provisions of the
treaty, marking another advance
for Egypt towards complete inde¬
pendence are as follows:
1. English right to maintain a
naval base at Alexandria for
which privilege she is to pay rent.
2. Right of the British to a
vast increase of the English air
force stationed in Egypt.
3. Egyptians assume the duty
to construct military roads assur¬
ing rapid transport of troops be¬
iween Alexandria and Suez Canal.
4. Egyptian independence in a
decade England helping Egypt
build up an Egyptian army and
possible London sponsorship of
Egypt for membership in the
League of Nations.


He stood up well at the end! I
can see him yet, poor impulsive Joe.
Desertion, but not cowardice, by the
Lord! No one who looked into
those straight blue eyes could be¬
lieve that. But they bandaged them.
I suppose. Well! a bullet in a bil¬
let more or less, what was it in that
wholesale slaughter? As a rain¬
drop on a willow tree drips into the
river and away to sea,—so that boy,
like a million others, dripped to
dust. A little ironical though, that
his own side should shoot him,
who went to fight for them two
years before he needed, to shoot him
who wouldn’t be legal food for pow¬
der for another mouth! A little
ironical, perhaps, that he had left
this son,—legacy to such an impla¬
cable world! But there’s no moral
to a true tale like this,—unless it
be that the rhythm of life and
death cares not a jot for any of us!


Trotzky Men
Are Executed
For plotting against the Soviet gov¬
ernment, sixteen followers of Leon
Trotzky, one-time leader of the Russian
revolution, were executed early last
week, after their plea for mercy was
rejected by the central executive com¬
mittee. Gregory Zinoviey and Leo Ka¬
meney, former Soviet officials, were
among those shot. Exiled Leader Trotz-
ky, commenting on the executions,
said: "My duty is to unmask one of
the great crimes in history and avenge
the executed. The executions were ne¬
cessary to prevent the unmasking of
the GPU by the defendants, but I, who
am represented as the chief promoter,
am alive.”

Guerilla Warfare

British soldiers patrolling the streets of Jerusalem to preserve peo

Palestine,


(NGLAND'S prestige, badly
shaken as a result of the col¬
E lapse of British diplomacy in
connection with the Italo Ethio¬
pian war and further deflated by
having to grant concessions to
Egyptian nationalists (see opposite
page), is threatened with another
setback in Palestine at the hands
of Arabian guerillas. For several
months now the British troops sta¬
tioned in Palestine have been an¬
noyed by Arabs who are trying to
drive out British protected Jews
in the Holy Land.
From Edward Neil, Associated
Press Foreign Staff writer, came
this description of an encounter be¬
tween British soldiers and Arabs:
“Ten trucks, convoyed by sol¬


diers move out of Jerusalek down


the long, winding, hilly ro


to


in
Nablus, center of Arab hostilik
the Talkarm section.
“Seared hills, browned ano
scorching, dotted with bouldersy
and dusty shrubs, roll up regularly
on either side of the twisting road.
“Busses with Jewish workers
are in the caravan. Private cars
and trucks are in the line, one
truck loaded with beds, and four
Jews riding on the front seat.
“Ahead, pacing the way goes a
wireless-equipped armored car
with machine guns mounted and
ready for action.
“Suddenly, 25 miles north of
Jerusalem, the radio crackles.
From an airplane overhead comes
a warning that 50 Arabs occupy a


long sloping hill five miles ahead.
“Soldiers take their positions
along the road in the glaring sun.
The cry “Arabs ahead” rolls
through the caravan. Detachments
of Seaforth Highlanders rush out
from Nablus. Two airplanes roar
down to only 100 feet above the
top of the hill, spewing machine¬
gun bullets. Troops encircle the
hill.
“At least 200 troops dep’oy on
the hillside, charging from rock to
rock, from bush to bush, firing as
they toil upward in the broiling
heat. Grey metal helmets reflect
the sunlight, the color of rocks and
shrubs.
“The Arabs withheld their fire
1 the soldiers are near the top
e hill. Then vo'ley after vol¬
leyY rs out. Then quiet.
“DN

stretchk bearers. Their burdens
are yot Arabs. neither more
than 20.

one with a rifle N "in his cheek¬
bone. These hudk n the gully,
surrounded by solok
then are
bundled off in a N toward


Nablus.
“Over the hilltops the firing con¬
tinues. A lance corporal of the
Seaforth Highlanders is hit, to die
later. Two more Arab dead are
brought in. Then calm.
“The airplane rises higher and
signals to the caravan: "All Clear,
Proceed.” The convoy moves for-
ward. Another incident in the
fighting is over.”


NEN REGULATION
FOR AIR PILOTS
Just to be sure that a pilot after
meeting with an accident is still intact
and fit to soar anew, a new regulation
requiring that air pilots meeting with
an accident must submit to physical
examination, recommended by Under¬
Secretary de la Cruz, was last week ap¬
proved by President Quezon.

in drug stores. It is a strong poi¬
son, containing over 50 per cent of
arsenic. According to Dr. Pablo
Anzures, of the U. P. medico-legal
department, 3 milligrams of this
powder is enough to cause poison¬
ing in the average man. One can
see how precious little is needed to
exterminate one tiny anay.
White arsenic might also be used,
according to Mr. Faustino Q. Ota¬
nes of the plant industry pest con-
trol division. This is even more
deadly than Paris green and is not
safe to use where food might be
contaminated by cockroaches and
rats which might gain access to the
termite nest treated.
Our own Derris powder might
likewise be used instead of the
dangerous (to human beings as
well) arsenic compounds. The only
drawback is that, it being a con¬
tact besides a stomach poison, the
termites powdered with it might
keel over and give up the ghost be¬
fore they have brought the deadly
dust to their comrades deep in the
colony.

there were Ee enough to retain for
her the sixth lace which she occu¬
pied in the pr—qus counting, due
to the spectaculal howing of Miss
Jose.
In the meanwhile, Connie Reyes
of Manila has gone dn to sixth,
but her leaders were pe¡dle. Al¬
though they dropped senforce¬
ments in her favor to thetune of
4,000 votes, she lost the fift place
on account of the Jose lantiide.
However, indications are that ass
Reyes’ backers are preparing fol
big surprise that will explode lik
a bomb in the next counting of
votes.
From thirteenth to tenth place
was the feat performed by Miss Fe
Castillejos of Caba, La Union. Ap-
proximately 3,500 votes were cast
by her supporters last Saturday,
causing her to grab tenth place
from Miss Rosalia F. Bares of
Aparri, Cagayan. The leaders of
Miss Carmen Canizares of Manila
likewise made a try to place her
among the ten leaders, but they
fell short of 50 votes to accomplish
this.
Unlike most of the southern can¬
didates, Miss Corazon Javellana
of Jaro, Iloilo, is steadily going up,
thanks to the efforts of her leaders
from the States. Last Saturday she
received 3,120 votes which enabled
her to clinch fifteenth place. On
the other hand, the leaders of Miss
Expedita Marapao of Loay, Bohol,
were caught napping last Saturday
and thereby caused her to drop
from twelfth to thirteenth place.
At this juncture, the contest
management begs to announce that
the ball in honor of the candidates
will be held at the Plaza Hotel next
October 3rd at 8:00 in the evening.

LUALHATI G. JOSE
FrHE biggest number of votes
ever received by a candidate
Ain one single counting so far
was registered in the name of Miss
Lualhati G. Jose, daughter of As¬
semblyman Felipe Jose and popular
co-ed of the Philippine Women’s
University, when her leaders cast
44,280 votes in her favor last Sat¬
urday. This big batch of votes en¬
abled her to leave eighth place and
move on to fourth, crowding out
Miss Asuncion Fallarme, another
strong Baguio candidate.
Although the leaders of Miss
Bennett, who has been leading the
contest for the past few weeks,
were silent last Saturday, she was
able to retain the leadership due to
the help of subscribers, who cast
2,850 votes in her favor. On the
other hand, the backers of Miss
Florentina Festejo of Fort Stot¬
senburg were active, dropping al¬
most 9,000 votes in her name.
While this failed to clinch first
place for the diminutive candidate,
it nevertheless caused Miss Festejo
to leave third place and landed her
on second. The inactivity of Miss
Lolita Lorenzana’s supporters was
costly as she dropped to third
place. The fight among these three
candidates is very keen; there is
no telling who of them will lead the
tilt in next Saturday’s counting.
While the sympathizers of Miss
Paz Jacinto, reputedly strong can¬
didate of Malabon, Rizal, registered
8,300 votes for her last Saturday,

Malacanang Has Purchased Yacht

—o0o—


Costs P120,000
The long-reported purchase by
the P. I. government of a Pres¬
idential yacht was confirmed by
Malacanang last week when it was
revealed that Casiana, now in Los
Angeles, was bought for the sum of
₱100,000.
Jorge B. Vargas, secretary to the
President, announced that the actual
purchase price of the P2,000,000 vessel
was ₱100,000 but drydocking and instal¬
lation of a wireless and radio telephone
has increased the total cost to P120,000.
At that price, the yacht was consi¬
dered a bargain because the Casiana
had been drydocked for extensive re-
pairs five years ago, costing the owner
about P400,000. Purchase negotiations
were handled by the Dollar Steamship
Company.
The yacht will be brought here by Fi¬
lipino officers and a crew, possibly un¬
der the command of Captain Jose Ma¬
nosa, of the coastguard cutter Arayat.

Owing to the seriousness of some of

of Labor, the confirmation of his re¬
appointment to that post was held up
by the commission on appointments of
the National Assembly last August 26th
when it confirmed 50 other appoint-
ments made by President Quezon. Dir.
Cruz was dismissed as head of the labor
bureau, which was later dissolved. Mr.
Cruz will be summoned personally be¬
fore the commission to answer the
charges.
Likewise, the confirmation of Judge
Mariano Albert’s appointment to the p
court of appeals was held in the abey¬
ance due to a protest filed by former
Judge Guillermo Guevara which had
not been acted upon by the commis¬
sion.

The peace pipe has not yet been
smoked between City Mayor Posadas
and Board President Manuel de la
Fuente. For the old controversy has
flared up again, this time anent a sup¬
posed “political gesture" on the part of
Mayor Posadas regarding a resolution
of gratitude sent by a group of labo¬
rers who were given jobs, which the
board president resented.
Said de la Fuente: “The publicity
which the mayor sought in regards to
the resolution allegedly submitted by
170 laborers who were given jobs, aside
from being a mere publicity stunt, will
create social unrest among the hun¬
dreds who have not received appoint-
ments...”

When Francisca Elagas of Binalo¬

old Martin Asuncion the other Thurs¬
day, she was boloed to death in a
cornfield by the spurned suitor, ac-
cording to his confession to the con¬
stabulary five days later. Spurned
Suitor Martin Asuncion would not
have felt so sore about it, had he not
noticed that the woman showed a de¬
cided preference for his uncle Lucio
Asuncion. To make complications
worse, the woman was married to a
man now in the U. S.—A. N. ovana.

Secietary Torres, Under-Secretary of
Public Works and Communications de
la Cruz, and Acting Director of Public
Works Marcial Kasilag in conference


decided to increase by 20 per cent the
wages of laborers on public works. Due
to shortage of funds, no higher increase
could be given. The minimum wage
paid to laborers on public works at

COMMENTS


NO NEED FOR YT would not be natural were commercial and
UNDUE ALARM I industrial interests and the people in gen¬
eral to display complete indifference in the face
of the possible loss of the American market to Philippine export
products. There is a certain and very natural nervousness here con¬
cerning the possible total exclusion of Philippine goods from the
United States because what the loss of the American market will mean
to the economic life of the Philippines is not at all an academic ques¬
tion. Such loss promises temporary if not permanent ruin of the
present export industries of the Islands.
But if at present the United States is actually concluding recipror-
treaties with countries to which she sells and from which she Pys,
by what argument can we be sure that the United States whict sells
to us no little of her products will single the Philippines to rey-se her
present policy of reciprocity with other nations? While it is fue that
to the United States the Philippine trade is not as vital ag-he United
States trade is to the Philippines, and logically the U. S. ill not miss
P. I.-U. S. trade as much as the Islands will, it is more ue that econ¬
omic laws have a way of conquering narrow and ill-for-ded prejudices.
There are Philippine products which the U. S. need and cannot raise
profitably and in sufficient quantities. There ar goods the Islands
must buy from the outside. Here is a situation wich can be, and very
probably, will be, the basis of some sort of myiality between the two
y countries.


A FRIEND PASSES AWAY TEHF Sorrow inspired by the
Aleath of Secretary of War
George H. Dern is the more keenly f-t here because aside from the
fact that as head of the departmen 'of war in the U. S. government
he had supervision over the Philippjes, he had proved himself a friend,
always willing and ready to defe-i the interests of this country as far
as was consistent with his owr duties as a patriotic American citizen
and public official.
Forever, these words offaith in Filipino capacity, delivered by the
late Secretary of War ee the occasion of the inauguration of the
Philippine Commonwea! ., Sshould inspire Filipinos to go unfaltering on
the road they have ch sen:
“I should be m st unfair, people of the Philippines, if I did not
point out that ma  credit for the rapid evolution of your popular gov-
ernment is due, - yourselves. You have been tried and not found
wanting.”:
ANOTHEZ GOOD EXAMPLE TRECHNICAL Adviser Francis B.
1 Harrison has resigned from the
Philippire government service because, as he himself explained, under
an existing rule which, by the way, he promulgated himself when he
was governor-general of the Islands, he could not engage in private
busivess while working as a government official.
If you knew that in this country of ours this prohibition is lightly
4 among government officials and flagrantly violated through sub-
uge if not openly, you would be praising the actuation of Mr. Harri¬
son, too. You would praise it the more because Mr. Harrison did not
have to be so meticulous about his concept of public duty. He is the
friend of the mightiest in the Philippines and they are indebted to
him for past considerations. It would be contrary to Filipino nature
to call Mr. Harrison down had he elected to dabble in business while
holding his job as technical adviser on communications for President
Quezon.
But Mr. Harrison chose to be fastidious and in so doing he has
