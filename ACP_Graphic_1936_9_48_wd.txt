—T is all over now: Ethiopia is already
Italian. Haile Selassie has hot-footed
Mit with members of his family and
trusted officials to a place safe from Ita¬
lian bombs and tanks. We have an ac¬
count of the last stage of the debacle, on
page 4. If you have misgivings about our
future as an independent state, you will
without difficulty picture us, Filipinos, in
the near future in the same predicament
the Ethiopians are in now. But if you
believe in bahala na, you will be more in
earnest about national defense.
E NE thing you will like to read is
the recommendation of Dr. Rafael
Palma, chairman of the National
Council on Education, with respect to the
overhauling of the country’s educational
system. We want you to read it as very
likely you are in school yourself or have
one or two kids in school and we want
you to squawk a lot if you think Dr. Pal¬
ma’s ideas do not coincide with yours.
WOU may not know it yet but begin¬
ning to-day you will hear a
great deal about arguments for and,
maybe, against woman suffrage. A’l be¬
cause the local women are set on collect¬
ing the required 300,000 affirmative wo¬
men votes the Constitution requires be¬
fore suffrage can be extended to the la¬
dies. We are doing our part in behalf of
the ladies on page 8 where you will find
Dr. Paz Mendoza-Guazon’s plea for a
square deal for women.
r E do not know just how far Bud¬
geter Under-Secretary Marabut
will get in this job of his of pro¬
ducing order out of chaos in the national
budget. If you are a government em¬
ployee, it is not likely you will like what
he plans to do. For your information,
however, you had better turn to page 9.
rT seems there are a few Filipinos in
IHollywopd who help movie people car¬
ry the burden of acting. Their share
of the burden, to be sure, is not much to
write home about, but it is a good thing
to be able to say you have acted in Holly¬
wood. Do you know that a Paco, Manila,
young man is one of a few Filipinos try¬
ing to make good in Hollywood? On page
10, you will find P. C. Morantte’s latest
broadcast from the film capital of the
world.
WOU will be interested to know that
X somewhere in Camarines Norte,
the natives make money easily and
as easily lose it. Turn to page 12 and,
incidentally, you will know that there is
a lot of money in iron ore—that is, if you
can find it.
N pages 14 and 15, are things dear
Oto martial men. The chief of staff
of the army gives an idea of his
plans and ambition (page 14) and on the
next page is convincing evidence that
they are quite serious about making the
army amount to something.
JE have never been able to stifle the
Wurge to go to Mindanao and make
our fortune and no doubt there are
many people in the same boat with us.
The article on page 16 has not dampened
our enthusiasm, but we find it very en¬
lightening and when we finally sail for

THE SPOTLIGHT

the promised land, we shall be prepared.
And speaking of the promised land, we
might go to Davao instead of Lanao, as
it is about time a Filipino shared in the
wealth of the province which, according
to the article on page 20, is enriching
everybody else but the native.
T.O, we have not forgotten A. E. L.’s
Nopus on page 22. Those of you,
girls, who aspire to be "ladies of
the quill" should not miss this. But even
if you naturally love confession stories
and true romances, do not give up hope,
after reading A. E. L.s article, of ever
becoming one of the "ladies of the quill."
AS for the local story:
A it is by one of the
ladies of the quill, by the
Pacita Pestano as A. E. L.
would put it. Miss Pes¬
tano could have published
this story in the Tribune
(it is she who determines
the fate of short stories
submitted to the Tri¬
bune), but perhaps she
thinks there is no fun in
P. E. Pestano
running your story in
your own paper knowing
you can publish it any time you wish it.
If you remember, a year ago her Once
Upon A Time appeared in  .
Release, this week’s local fiction, we like
better: and don’t ask why: we are not
the literary editor. And do not blame
Miss Pestano if you don’t like the title.
She did not put any title to the story and
we had to supply one.
Y HEN Kiko, Fran¬
Wcisco Reyes, of our
art staff, gets a bit
tired of his routine, illus¬
trating for our many ma¬
gazines, he hauls out his
brushes, oils, and palette.
This time the result is
the beautiful portrait of
a beautiful woman repro¬
duced on the cover. The
lady when she saw the
F. Reyes
picture said she did not
realize she was so beautiful, and Kiko
looked so pleased.

SENTENCE from P. C. Morant-
te’s next article from Hollywood:
A "The hoggest, lousiest, dunderhead-
est bunch of movie extras in Hollywood
are the Filipinos. That’s just a sample
of what P. C. can write when he gets
sore.
By the way P C., here’s something for
you from a lady reader: “Do you have
to print Morantte’s cheap stuff?'
A. E. L. promised to send the second
part of What Our Writers Read. We
want to call your attention to the word
promised. A. E. L. feels absolutely sure
you are dying for his stuff, so if you fail
to find that second part next week, don’t
blame us. You must have noticed Little
Things has been wandering all over the
magazine, but that is no fault of ours.
It is so easy to fall back on that "Im-
not-feeling-well-to-day” stunt. But the
bachelorettes are probably back in Manila
by now and A. E. L.s stuff may prob¬
ably come in regularly.

Cheap Power


VT has been announced that the National Economic
1 Council has under study the development of water
power in the Philippines. The study is very timely. If
there is one problem that will yield far-reaching benefits
to the country when solved, it is the problem of low-cost
power which can run cheaply the machinery of local
industries.
The general supposition is that the Philippines can very well
produce many of the products being imported at present. To do
this, it is necessary to establish factories. Factories, naturally,
need machinery, and power is needed to run factory machines.
But we need cheap power, much cheaper than the kind
we get from imported coal, fuel oil, and gasoline. The
present cost of imported fuel will make it practically im¬
possible to run small factories profitably. And if we can¬
not run factories profitably, how can we produce many of
the products we import at present?


Because we have no coal of the desired quality and in the de¬
sired quantity, because we have no fuel oil, there is only one way
to have cheap power, only one way to give the contemplated in¬
dustries the chance to survive: and it is to harness our falls
and rivers. But the government will have to undertake the task
of getting electricity out of water power as only in this way may
electricity at low cost be had. Power stations under government
operation will not be run for profit and the cost of electricity
produced will be reasonable and cheap enough to encourage the
establishment of new enterprises.
If the plan to start new industries here has any
seriousness behind it, the first problem to tackle is that
of power. The National Economie Council, if it is true
that it is studying the development of water power in the
country, is working in the right direction. Cheap power
is the first requisite. If we cannot have that, it is idle to
dream of any degree of industrialization in the Philip-
pines and futile to even think of producing products we
buy to-day from the outside.

saw it in that light and bitterly
answered back: “Even though we
asked to be taken home at the ex¬

we wish to make plain that we are
not hungry yet. We came home

not because we are failures."

brought to the surface the almost
challenging attitude of these Fili¬
pinos who were the first to take
advantage of the repatriation law
signed by President Roosevelt last
July 10, 1935.
A police photographer was tak¬
ing the pictures of the repatriates
in small groups, when one of them
remarked that it did not seem ne¬
cessary as they were not criminals;
besides, they were already hungry.
A member of the receiving commit¬
tee explained that if they were
hungry, they would be fed soon.
Perhaps he did not mean it as an
insult, but one of the repatriates


The Filipino repatriates and those who welcomed them, photographed aboard the s. s. President Coolidge.


So eager were they to return to
their families that they could scar¬
cely wait for the bureau of cus¬
toms formalities to be over. That
same day 56 of the group were on
their way to their homes; the rest
remained in the city because they
wanted to see the sights first, while
some had to wait for inter-island
ships that would take them to the
south.
“We Are Not Hungry Yet!”
An incident which took place on
board the s.s. Pres. Coolidge while


Above is the s. s President Coolidge.
which brought the first group of Filipino
repatriates from U. S.


FrHERE was nothing apologe¬
tic or shamefaced in the at¬
Atitude of the 67 repatriates
who arrived on board the s. S.
President Coolidge in Manila last
Sunday morning. Though not
exactly coming home as victors,
they were thrilled to step once
more on the home soil which many
of them had not seen for over 10
years.


Of the 25 provinces represented
in this first batch, Ilocos Sur took
the lead in the number of repa¬
triates, 10 being from that prov-
ince. Pangasinan and Manila
ranked next with 6 each. Pam-
panga had 3, Ilocos Norte 2, Tar¬
lac 1, Bulacan 1, Zambales 2, Ca¬
gayan 1, Nueva Vizcaya 1, Taya¬
bas 1, Camarines Sur 1, Sorsogon
1, Iloilo 4, Negros 1, Leyte 5, Ca¬
piz 1, Surigao 1, Samar 1, Cebu 1,
Misamis 1, Cavite 2, Rizal 1, Nueva
Ecija 3, Albay 1, and Marinduque 1.
This number does not include:
members of their families: three
women and six children. Of the
children one was a babe in arms.
A young American girl, the wife
of one of the repatriates, rode on
the same boat. The expenses of the
members of the repatriates’ fami¬
lies were not shouldered by the
American government but were
raised by an American organization
in California..
Around ₱11,500 were spent by
the American government for the
transportation of the 60 repatriates
from America to their home towns.

Tuesday afternoon, as the head of
his legions in Africa passed
through the gates of Addis Ababa.
Almost simultaneously Jijiga, the
key city on the southern front of
Ethiopia fell into the hands of Gen¬
eral Graziani’s soldiers. Harrar,
the second largest town in Abys¬
sinia, also on the southern front,
likewise capitulated last Friday.
Asmara was likewise reported cap¬
tured.
Like what happened in Addis
Ababa, the natives of Harrar set
buildings on fire, looted homes,
and shot at everybody when the en¬
trance of the invading Italian forces
seemed imminent. General Gra¬
ziani’s forces were only 10 miles
away when the rioting started.
Selassie Reaches Haifa
Whi e Addis Ababa and Jijiga
were being occupied by the Italians,
King Selassie was fleeing his king¬
dom, bound for Jerusalem. He
arrived with the members of his
family at Pori Said on board the
British cruiser Enterprise last


Emperor Haile Selassie, with his son,
Prince Makonnen, inspecting the damage
done by an Atalian bomb. The emperor
has fled from kis country together with
his family and trusted aides.


Thursday, landed at Haifa, Syria,
the same day. The party proceeded
to the holy city, where the king
established his family.
"Long Live The Emneros!
A huge loyalty deronstration
was staged by the cheering Ital¬
ians last Thursday evening, shout¬
ing the Italian king’s name. Sud¬
denly somebody substituted an im¬
perial for the royal title. Soon
everybody was shouting, "Long live
the Emperor!”
To Annex Ethicpia
Last Thursday it was expected
that Mussolini would announce the
following Saturday the annexation
of Ethiopia. The organ of the
Fascist government stated that
‘there is only one possible outcome


to the problem regarding Abyssinia
—its annexation, pure and simple,
to Italy. This annexation would
correspond to Italy’s right as the
conqueror and to the right of the
native population of Ethiopia to
have the peace, order, and protec-

The economic future of Ethiopia

schemes will not be difficult be¬
cause it is said some American
bankers have promised the neces¬
sary cash.
Ethiops Kill Foreigners
No less than 26 foreigners were
known killed in Addis Ababa by
marauding Ethiopian mobs while
the Italian troops were on the out¬
skirts of the capital at the end of
the week before last. Among
these were the wife of an Amer¬
ican missionary, a British Red

Armenians who had tried to
defend their shops from the
looters. It was evident that the
natives wanted to reduce the city
to ashes before the Italian so diers
arrived.
This looting and burning of build¬
ings started the other Saturday,
the day after King Selassie fled
from the capital. The day following,
Sunday, conditions in the capital
became worse, as even parties con¬
veying refugees to the legations
were fired upon.
The Italians were eagerly ex¬
pected by the around 2,000 foreign-
ers who had sought refuge in the
legations. That Sunday the Ital¬
ian vanguard was but a dozen miles
away, sloshing through the rain and
mud.

The other Tuesday afternoon at
4 o’clock the head of the Ita ian

lew, was, as shawn above, used by
Italians in their Ethiopian campaign.


troops marching to Addis Ababa
under Field Marshal Pietro Badog¬
lio passed through the gates of the
capital, Before this, the Ethiopians
had fled to the hills. The vanguard,
mounted on twenty motorcycles,
roared past the British legation.
Nine baby tanks followed, then the
White Savauga division on milit¬
ary trucks. Behind these trailed
the staff cars carrying Badog io
and his generals. Askari infantry-
men preceded and followed the
staff.
Badoglio proceeded immediately
to the Italian legation where he
established general headquarters.
Soon the Italian flag was hoisted
over the looted Imperial palace. In


an hour the occupation of the cap¬
ital was comp.ete.
“Ethiopia Is Italian"
While the foreign flag was being
raised, Mussolini spoke before
thousands of Italians from a bal¬
cony overlooking the Piazza Vene¬
zia, telling them of the completion
of the conquest of Ethiopia. “Ethio¬
pia is Italian," he said. "I an¬


nounce to the Italian people and the
whole wor'd that peace had been
established."
Then he flung a challenge to the
world. “We are ready to defend
our victory with the same determin¬
ation with which we won it,” he de-
clared. “We feel that this inter¬
prets the unanimous will of our
fighters in Africa.” The mad'y
cheering crowd received Mussolini’s


challenge with “Hear that, Ge¬
neva!”
Italian Governor Named
The next day, Wednesday, Gen¬
eral Badoglio named Giuseppe Bot¬
tai, who was governor of Rome un¬
til he volunteered to join the ser¬
vice in Africa, civil governor of
Addis Ababa.

FOR the PUBLIC SCHOOL
SSRENSAGEAAOD


PALMA PROPOSES NEEDED
CHANGES IN THE PRESENT
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM


EVISION of the present
public school system to
Imake it conform to the
financial situation and social
needs of the conutry, is the plan
submitted to the National Council
on Education by its chairman, Dr.
Rafael Palma. The plan defines
three levels of education, namely,
primary, secondary, and higher
education.
Each level has its objective,
that of primary education being
to prepare an enlightened citizen¬
ry for a democracy; that of the
secondary to prepare for some
gainful occupation in life; and
that of higher education to pre¬
pare citizens for leadership in the
arts, sciences, and professions.
Five-Year Primary Course
The Palma plan would compress
the elementary grades to five years.
The instruction, to begin with chil-
dren of seven years, would be free
and obligatory. Emphasis would
be laid on moral and civic values
to give them an intelligent exercise
of their rights and fulfillment of
their responsibilities as citizens.
“After finishing the primary
grades," said Dr. Palma in his plan,
“the student may select between


Partial view of a U P. building. The
State University should keep its role of
maintaining a high standard for profes¬
sional and technical courses, according
to Dr. Palma.


Dr. Rafael Palma: submits plan revis¬
ing the present school system.
academic and vocational schools.
If he selects the academic courses
leading to the professions of law,
medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, and
philosophy, he must take an
entrance examination to show his
aptitude for higher professional
studies.” Competitive examina¬
tions will determine the fitness of
candidates for professional work,
and discourage those who have no
qualifications.
Local Conditions Considered
Types of schools to be establish-
ed will depend on the conditions of
a given locality.
In districts
adapted to profitable farming, the
agricultural course would be given
special attention; and when no
farm land is available, industrial
and commercial courses would be
given emphasis. In coastal towns,
courses on the utilization of sea
products would be introduced. It
would also be possible, added Dr.
Palma, to have in every province
at least four or five secondary
schools of the junior high school
level offering different types of
vocational courses.
These vocational secondary
schools should prepare the students,
as soon as they graduate, to engage
in gainful occupations needed in
their respective communities and be¬
come skilled laborers, mechanics,
electricians, printers, shoemakers,
workers in animal and reptile skin
industries, fishermen, industrial
and mine workers, potters and cera¬
mics workers, textile weavers,


and bakers.
Family Income Increased
Agricultural graduates can also
app'y their knowledge to poultry
raising, marketing of eggs and
chickens, raising swine and cattle,
all of which tend to increase the
family income. Horticulture is an¬
other opening for gainful activity,
because fruits and vegetables can
be easily sold in the community
and near-by towns. Commercial
secondary schools can produce not
only good bookkeepers, stenograph-
ers, and typists, but also managers
and owners of small retail stores in
the towns.
It is true that anybody can be¬
come an artisan, fisherman, or
farmer by applying primitive
methods, but the lack of technical
knowledge will mean little in the
way of contributing to the economic
development of the country.
The
Japanese, by the way, showed Dr.
Palma, are demonstrating the ad¬
vantages of technical knowledge
and vocational preparation. The
cultivation and development in Da¬
vao are scientific, so is Japanese
fishing along Manila Bay, and Jap-
anese carpenters are models of
efficiency.
Training Must Be Varied
“The proposed secondary educa¬
tion should be as varied as possi¬
ble to serve different occupations
in life,” reported Dr. Palma. "In
some of these occupations, it is
not necessary that the period of
training should last more than four
years. These schools should offer
academic and technical subject
matter to prevent the bad effect
of excessive specialization and to
enable those who have shown men¬
tal ability to pursue higher stu¬
dies....."
Secondary home economics
schools should be maintained, in¬
struction in home nursing must al¬
so be given, and courses in needle
work, loom weaving and textile in¬
dustries would open rich fields
for women.


“Adult education must be a part
of the system,” the Palma plan al¬
so stipulates. “It should provide
education to persons who have not
been fortunate enough to attend
school in their early days, and to
give them practical training along
occupations in which they are en¬
gaged.” Only persons from 20 to


The Gregorio del Pilar Elementary
School, Manila. The Palma plan seeks
te mahe elementary insfruction five in¬
stead of seven years.


As recommended by the Palma plan, a
stadent, after completing the primary
grades, may choose either a rocational
or an acadamic seheol. Above: the Ma¬
pa High School, an academic schaol.

Private High Schools
“The State can afford to leave
many of the secondary academic
schools to private initiative, only
regulating these schools through en¬
trance examinations and other means
to keep up a high standard. If the
State prefers to support a few of
these as type symbols, it should
make them self-supporting. They
should not admit students to
these schools unless they have
taken a mental examination in
order to determine the aptitude of
those who seek admission.
The
same subjects that are now of¬
fered in the high schools may be
offered, only adding scientific sub¬
jects now given in preparatory
courses in colleges and universities.
It should confer the title of Asso¬
ciate of Arts upon satisfactory


completion of the course.
On Higher Education
“Vocational education s hould
have corresponding courses in
higher education, coordinating the
courses for purposes of permitting
higher studies along the same lines.
The authorities of higher education
should decide what supplementary
qualification should be possessed
by those graduating from vocation-
al secondary courses. Most likely
a preparatory course of two years
on cultural subjects may be re¬
quired from those seeking admis¬
sion, or practical experience for a
certain period either on the farm
or in trade, depending upon the
particular line of study a student
intends to pursue.
Dr. Palma suggested establish¬
ment of normal schools for the
preparation of academic and voca¬
tional teachers.
Normal schools
and colleges of education of univ¬
ersity grade, however, are to be
distinguished, the latter limiting
their work to training university
professors and superintendents and
other supervisory and administra¬
tive officials of the Bureau of
Education, and in undertaking re¬
searches on educational problems.
The State University should keep
its role of maintaining a high
standard for professional and
technical courses, and should also
train original researchers. To com-
plete the branches of higher learn¬
ing, national schools for painting,
sculpture, and music should also be
added.

chauffeurs, 4 clerks. Seventeen of
them had college education, 18 had

Accompanying the bunch was
Thomas E. Borden of the U.S. De¬

coming here with the repatriates is
not the first time, he having been
in the Islands in 1902 as a school


teacher. He continued teaching un¬
til 1905 and then was transferred
to the bureau of internal revenue.
He went back to the States in 1913,
fully equipped to understand and
sympathize with the interests of
Filipinos.
Rehabilitation
According to Mr. Borden, the
activities of propagandists in the
U.S. urging Filipinos not to take
advantage of repatriation are still
intense. “These propagandists like

WHY EHe LADIES WANT fO VOTE


WOMAN LEADER PLEADS FOR
PERMANENT SUFFRAGE
By DR. M. PAZ MENDOZA-GUAZON


YrVHE machine revolutionized
the home, the farm, the fac-
tories, the government—in a
word—the earth. It changed old
methods of living, working, fight-
ing, and thinking. New ideals have
been born, new deeds crea' ed,
new laws enacted, and new beliefs
formed.
In this new environment, people
have found that organization and
training are imperative needs be¬
cause there is little demand for
the amateur. The ability to read
and write has become the criterion
by which one’s intellectual capa¬
city is judged and education is
eagerly sought by the people and
made a duty of progressive na¬
tions.
What are the effects of this new
order of affairs on women? The
development of mechanical devices
and the introduction of scientific
methods of caring for the sick, the

children, and the home decreased
steadily the sphere of action of wo¬
men. It broke the bars of the cage
in which she had been kept for so
long and compelled her to seek work
outside her home in order to sup¬


port herself and those who depend-
ed on her.
To-day, we hear of women as
professors, bankers, physicians,
lawyers, magistrates, legislators,
and lastly as intrepid flyers cross¬
ing the oceans. The women of to¬
day are the result of the new order
which the machine has produced.
Just as the primitive woman was
the right comrade for the primitive
man; the medieval woman, the re-
flection of the inferiority complex
which dul ed the mind of the male
sex in that age; the modern woman,
“is the resu’t of the modern drama
behind the scene of which stands
the scientists and inventors large¬
ly invisible and unnoticed; yet de¬
termining by their machines and
discoveries the habits and lives of
every woman and man."
The problems that modern wo¬
men have to solve differ from those
which confronted the women of the
past. The first and the hardest of
all is the old concept of things. We
have to admit with Robinson in his
“Ordeal of Civilization" that the
old habits of thought yield reluctant-
ly to the new, we continue to think
of new things in old ways; because
the old is at the bottom a habit,
the new, an adventure, and the old
always enjoy the right of way.
The second problem is the rela¬
tion of the wife and mother with
the business, factory or professional
woman. The industrial Age that
is invading the Orient is knocking


woman from her old seat at the
spinning wheel and indirectly from
her home. Does it mean that she
has to leave her old duties, be man¬
nish or man’s equal? Who must
take care of her chi dren while she
is away in the office or in the fac-
tory? This question does not refer
only to feeding the child with so
many teaspoonfuls of milk in so
many tablespoonfuls of boiled wa¬

intimately acquainted with the

therefor; (c) the assignment of
particular activities to particular
scrvices; and (d) the re-grouping
or coordination of services."
Embraces Wide Scope
The budget office is a new of-
fice, and, for this reason, its prob¬
lems are of more than passing in¬
terest. Charged as it is with the
duty of making a detailed study of
all departments, bureaus, and of¬
fices of the government, and of
laying the foundation for their re¬
crganization, the problems of the
budget office are of interest to all.
Besides, the functions of the of-
fice link it to all government of¬
fices.
Furthermore, the most serious
problems confronting the govern¬
ment to-day are mostly financial.
The budget bureau is charged with
the important duty of preparing
the budget for the President for
submission to the National Assem¬
bly, so the stabilization of our gov-
ernment finance devolves upon it.

ECAUSE in pictures he has
played innumerable parts:
Das a sinister Malay chief, a
mean looking caliphate officer, a
wily Mandarin, a complaisant Es¬
kimo. Fraser Acosta, a full-blooded
Filipino, should be accorded the
honor of being the Philippines"
outstanding character actor in Hol¬
lywood. To be sure, his friends
Messrs. Valerio V. Duran and
Juan Torena can share the accol¬
ade this writer generously bestows
upon Mr. Acosta; and as far as
the Phi ippines is concerned, these
three film players are the coun¬
try’s outstanding contributions to
movieland.


In stature he is five
feet nine and a half in¬
ches, weighs 175 lbs.
His shoulders are
straight and broad. At
close range his com¬
plexion is carnation
with a tinge of coffee in it; at a
distance, however, it changes to
coffee with just enough cream in it.
But it is this capriciousness of


Eskimo or Mexican or Turk. This
week he plays as an American In¬
dian, next week as a Chinaman.
And so on. So that it may be said
that with physical assets like Mr.
Acosta’s, the chances of starving in
Hollywood are quite remote. And
one can readily appreciate or rejoice
over his achievement and give him
the full measure of good luck for
his successful efforts to compete
against 12,416 credited extras in
Hollywood, not excluding among
these extras Carlos de Castro and
Valerio V. Duran. (Mr. Torena is
not included, he being a feature
player now.) Out of these 12,416.
approximately 500 are available


daily, that is, 500 needed by the
studios.
But Mr. Acosta supplements his
good luck with nerve and with un¬
swerving determination to get work,
any kind of movie job. To such
end he uses a perceptible dash of
initiative and resourcefulness. Thus
he always wins.
“I remember,” he said, “the first
time I got into pictures. I heard
Universal studio needed a Malay, a
Malay interpreter, a Malay actor,
and yes, a Malay director. When I
heard this I went to Universal City.
You know, I speak the Malay dialect.
I was not bluffing. I wanted to get

the recently discovered offspring
of the much-talked-of Mutiny on

the job. I realize it was a big job,
but I know I could tackle it, I was
prepared for it. When I arrived
there at the studio I was asked to
speak a certain line in the Malay
dialect. Of course I translated it
from English to Malay. You know
the Malay dialect sounds more like
the Moro and I know that, too, I
learned these dialects in Mindanao
and Penang, Borneo. So as I said
I passed the test and at once the
studio officials hired me in all
three offices: a Malay interpreter
an actor, and a technical director
for $150.00 a week. This was be¬
fore the talkie boom. This was a
lot of money then. I was very hap-
py to get the job I could not sleep
for nights thinking it over. Then
and there I plunged into real motion
picture acting. The studio people
knew I could act, so they gave me
more parts.
"What Universal pictures have
you made?” asked this writer,
"How many?
“Let me see,” Mr. Acosta reflected
for a long moment, evidently trying
to marshall those pictures wherein
he had appeared in more or less im¬
portant roles. He mentioned the
following: East of Java, Sutter’s
Gold, Perils of Pauline Pirate
Treasure What Price Decency, She
Daughter of the Dragon, Return of
Chandu, Roaming Lady. War Cor¬
respondent, The Last Outpost, and
the present The Lost Horizon, now
under production. “In the East oj
Java picture,” he said, "I had quite
a good part. I was the native Bing


Crosby. I played a native instru¬
ment, the lute, and I also sang. I
think, all in all, that is, including
the bit parts and background parts
I appeared in, I must have played
in around seventy pictures.
played a background bit in Rudolph
Valentino’s Shiek. I was in Gua¬
dalupe that time. I think it was my
first venture into acting, before i
had a real job at Universal."
"Did motion picture acting at¬
tract you before you came to Amer¬
ica?
“Yes. I was crazy about the mo¬
vies even when I was a kid in Ma¬
nila, replied Mr. Acosta.
“In your present extra job, that
is, in The Lost Horizon picture you
are in now what part do you have?
“Some kind of a Tibetan soldier.
I think. I am not so sure yet.
will not exactly know about it, not
until next week when we go into
actual shooting,” he said.
Because of this latest picture of
Mr. Acosta, wherein he is cast as a
Tibetan, he has a hank of hair that
spreads right down upon his
shoulders. He hasn’t had a hair
cut for about a year now.
Fraser Acosta has a certain ver¬
satility, a palpable ability to adapt
and portray a character totally di¬
vorced from his Malay personality,
But in spite of the many parts he
has already played, he has not as
yet reached the finesse of a master
actor He has not yet given us a
good account of himself on an in¬
spired emotional scene; he had the
chance in three pictures, among


Fraser Acosta, in another of his roles:
a Malayan lute play er in ' East of Java."


which are East of Java and Perils
of Pauline but failed. His roles
were not by any means insignifi¬
cant, and they offered him oppor¬
tunities to display acting ability.
But he only acted the whole scene
instead of living it. This is what
makes the difference between qua¬
lity and mere smug and safe por¬
trayal. But let’s give him a chance;
he is on his way up, consistently
climbing higher every day. He has
skill and he has promise.
Asked whether he obtained his
education from the Navy, as propa¬
gandized by pamphleters of Uncle
Sam, Mr. Acosta laughingly replied:
“No. Because of the Navy I was
able to travel around the world. I
started my schooling in Manila, in
the Paco Elementary School. I was
president of the Intermediate De¬
bating Club if it matters anything
at all. Then I went to high school
and I finished that too. I went to
La Salle College where 1 obtained
my AB. That’s my background.
Oh, yes. I was an athlete. I indulged
in boxing. I still go in for that, be¬
ing one of my favorite exercises. l
like baseball. And when I was in
the Navy I often played football.
Of course I was no football star.
but I sometimes substituted for
stars in real games.
"Are you married?"
He laughed. His eyes were
frank when he said, "No. I am not
married and I don’t intend to. (I
hope he won’t betray me as Jack
Oakie did. Two weeks after I asked
Mr. Oakie whether he intended to
marry or not and he replied in the
negative, he ankled to the altar with
Venita Varden. That’s what I call a
"liar and traitor. But then, one
can’t tell the ways of Cupid in

FrOm IRON to CASH to VICE
CAMARINES NORTE IRON MINES DOING WELL- LABORERS ON
SPENDING SPREE MOST OF THE TIME


Many people watch closely the
fluctuations in the gold stock
market and are quite unaware
that there are mines other than
go d in the Philippines. There
is an iron mine in Camari¬
nes Norie which is making more
money than a great many of
the present gold mines. To-day
the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc.,
operating at Larap and Calamba¬
yungan, near Mambulao, Camari¬
nes Norte, ships iron ore in such
quantities that it can afford to
spend around a million pesos for
laborers’ salaries alone.
VrITH the number of laborers
Wincreased from less than 1,000
last year to 1,723 this year and with
all building projects completed, the
company expects to ship to Japan
more than the 450,000 tons ordered
for 1936. That will mean a pro¬
duction of 140,000 tons more than
what the company produced and ex¬
ported in 1935, which was 310,000
tons. Already the company has
shipped to the Empire of the Ri¬
sing Sun 154,749 tons from Jan¬
uary to April of this year, and it
hopes to ship about 66,000 tons in
May alone.

Only two years old, the Philip-

ahead with unbelievable speed.

Started on April 11, 1935, with a
capital of P2,400 000, it first loaded
a ship from Japan with iron five
months later. The iron exportation
for that year totaled 15,000 tons.
This was due to the fact that at the
time work was mainly directed at
construction: houses for the labor¬
ers, buildings to house the various
offices, and the hospital. A bridge,
over which runs a kilometer of rails,
was constructed to connect Calam¬
bayungan Island with Larap. A
wharf was built on the shore of Ca-
lambayungan, stretching hundreds
of meters out into the sea. Big
ships like the s. s. Ortow (10,000
tons), the s. s. Ryujin Maru (8,900
tons), and the China Importer
(7,500 tons) dock alongside of this
wharf to receive the thousands of
wagons of iron ore.
Asked why the company chooses
to send its products to Japan, the
company’s Big Boss, who is so mo¬
dest he did not want his name pub¬
lished, said that should its iron be
exported to some other countries
like the United States, it would be
unprofitable.
U. S. Freight Costs High
“The freight of iron per ton from
the Philippines to the United States
is more than the selling price of the
metal per ton in America,” the

superintendent explained. "On the
other hand, Japan offers fairly
good price for iron, and the freight
from this country to Japan is rea¬
sonab'e.
The superintendent explains how
the company benefits many Filipi¬
nos: “We use more manual labor
than machinery, although we un¬
derstand the latter means more eco¬
nomy and speed. Our payroll
amcunts to P65,000 monthly.”
In one solid year, therefore, the
iren vi.lage spends some P780,000 for
salaries alone. But where does this
salary go?
Folly of Laborers
Well, there’s the Ca’ambayungan
Blues, a big cabaret which is spa¬
cious enough to accommodate 50
dancing pairs, besides 200 or more
customers. It nets around P50 dur¬
ing crdinary nights, and the amount
runs to three figures during pay day
Topadas are not an uncommon sight
in the streets every afternoon
These are the two most expensive
recreations indulged in by the min¬
ers. Basketbal and volleyball
games are, however, indulged in by
few young men. On special occa¬
sions, the entire mining district
goes into festive mood, as it did dur¬
ing the inauguration of the Com-
monwealth. It may be mentioned
that the company’s contribution
collected from the laborers, for that
celebration was ₱1,500.
Of course, the government offers

NROM 1925 to the time when
I was compelled—yes, you,
k compelled is the word—to
take a vacation, I kept pretty close
track of Philippine literature in
English. But since I left the of¬
fice for the nonce (whew!), I have
read but a few local works.
On the other hand, however, my
enforced leisure has enabled me to
read some of the famous books, new
and old, which in my busier days
I had to forego for at least the time
being: “Look Homeward, Angel,
by Thomas Wolfe, “Fathers and
Sons"—than which I know of no
better novel—by Ivan Turgenev,
“Wine From These Grapes” by
Edna St. Vincent Millay, "Anthony
Adverse” by Hervey Allen, "Shan¬
dygaff” by Christopher Morley,
“The Romantic Comedians” by Ellen
Glasgow, “Round Up" by Ring
Lardner, “Enough Rope” by Doro¬
thy Parker, "My Country and My
People” by Lin Yutang, etc., etc.
Right now, I am reading “The
Bridal Wreath” by Sigrid Undset,
having just finished “The Return
of the Native” by Thomas Hardy.
“The Return of the Native’
proved to be unexpectedly enjoy¬
able. I did not doubt that it would
be impressive as a literary work,
but I had misgivings as to its be¬
ing particularly appealing, because
I understood that Hardy saw life
with gloomy eyes and recorded it
with depressing realism.
Well, he cannot, certainly, be
classified with the Pollyana school
of writers. But compared with the
steel-stemached novelists of our
harsh and hardened times, Hardy¬
in “The Return of the Native, at
all events—is to no negligible ex
tent optimistic. What a contrast
Thomasin, Clym, Venn, and Mrs.
Yeobright are to the warped char
acters—perverts, pathological cases
and the rest of the dark company
—sardonically dangled before our
eyes by such contemporaries as
Eugene O'Neill, Erskine Caldwell
William Faulkner, and Sherwood
Anderson! Why, even Eustacia and
Wildeve shine beside the animals
who cavort in many a modern no¬
vel.
It is true, though, that Hardy is
rather determinedly tragic. Some
writers are criticized for contriving
happy endings at the price of veri¬
similitude, Hardy in “The Return
of the Native, risks sacrificing
plausibility by depending: a bit too
much on coincidences to bring about
disaster. This is a minor fault
however: the book is undeniably
H-¬
it is en¬
pical


chantingly well-written, not only
sparkling with epigrams but lus¬
trous with gems of description. Con¬
sider this passing picture of Tho¬
masin:
“In her movements, in her gaze,
she reminded the beholder of the
feathered creatures who lived
around her home All similes and
allegories concerning her began and
ended with birds There was as
much variety in her motions as in
their flight. When she was musing
she was a kestrel, which hangs in
the air by an invisible motion of
its wings When she was in a high
wind her light body was blown
against trees and banks like a her¬
on’s When she was frightened
she darted noiselessly like a king¬
fisher When she was serene she
skimmed like a swallow...
And this partial portrait of Eus¬
tacia:
“She was in person full-limbed
and semewhat heavy: without rud-
diness, as without pallor; and soft
to the touch as a cloud. To see her
hair was to fancy that a whole win¬
ter did not contain darkness enough
to form its shadow: it closed over
her forehead like nightfall extin¬
guishing the western glow... The
mouth seemed formed less to speak
than to quiver, less to quiver than
to kiss. Some might have added,
less to kiss than to curl. Viewed
sideways, the closing line of her
lips formed, with almost geometric
precision, the curve so well known in
the arts of design as the cima-recta,
or egee... So fine were the lines
of her lips that, though full, each
corner of her mouth was as clearly
cut as, the point of a spear...
To come upon such elegant and
exuberant phraseology after the
stripped style of an Ernest Heming¬
way or the slovenly diction of a
Theodore Dreiser is to wonder why
modern authors are so proud of
their economy of words and their
indifference to mere manner. There
is such a thing as foolish economy,
and while the what should be rated
higher than the how, the latter has
its own importance in literature.
Think of the ladies in the clas¬
sics. Would you not dare all the
Doones if, like John Ridd, you had
a Lorna to strengthen you? Would
you not tilt as readily as Ivanhoe
for a Rowena or a Rebecca? But
the “heroines" of present-day no¬
vels—too often, when they are at
all described, the description wak¬
ens the rake rather than the poet

Moves To Army Headquarters
The other Tuesday, a day after
he was inducted into office by Pres¬
ident Quezon, he moved from Mala¬
canang and ensconced himself in
the room formerly occupied by Bri¬
gadier General Basilio Valdes as
chief of the constabulary. General
Valdes had moved into the office of
General Guillermo Francisco which
they now share. He wore civilian
clothes during his first day at head¬
quarters.
“I would rather not talk about my
plans for the Army,” he said, when
the subject was broached to him.
"Just now I am an ordinary layman,
and all that I might say would
sound like hollow theories. I would
rather go into action right from
the start and let what I shall be
able to do speak for themselves. In
three months, say, the people wi'l
know the plans I have in mind
now."
He would not divulge his plans
but he was very definite in the goal
he intends to attain. “We are going
to have an army that is equal to
the best in the world,” he volun¬
teered. “We cannot fail, what with
the backing of President Quezon
and the National Assembly, and the
guidance of Gen. MacArthur. We
have the funds needed to enable us

It was he who was instrumental
in the transferring of Bilibid to
the wide spaces of Muntinglupa,
who dreamed of prisoners earning
their keep and at the same time
learning how to till the soil in the
new prison site outside the city
boundaries.
He expressed confidence in the
capabilities of Capt. Eriberto Misa,
his successor, in carrying on the
work in the prisons bureau. “He
is the most logical man to pick the
threads of the work I left,” Gen.
Santos said. “There are equally as
capable men in the other penal co¬
lonies—for example, the superin¬
tendent of the Davao Penal Colony
and that of the San Ramon Penal
Farm—but Capt. Misa is the most
logical man.

Outside, extending almost a kilo¬

aerodrome, Bilibid prisoners are
busy leveling the rough surface

paved with stones to insure smooth

that drops anchor at Davao, there
are crowded in its third-class com¬
partment numerous adventurers
from the North who have found
their towns too crowded to offer
even the most meagre comforts of
life.
The bulk of these intrepid souls
comes from Cebu, Bohol, and Leyte.
But there are those who come from
the Tagalog regions, the Bicol pro¬
vinces, and even the Ilocos. For
days they watch their ship plow the
sea which brings them nearer and
reater to the land they have heard
so much about—where their dreams
will come true. They bring to that
section of Mindanco, where land can
be had for the asking (so they were
told), souls wearied and chastised
in their native haunts by a strug¬
gle too great for them. They hope
to find surcease in this far-away
land.
Discontented Men
These are men in the breasts of
whom rumb'e a dull discontent loud¬
er than that in their stomachs.
They cannot understand why so ma¬
ny people who are less deserving
manage to live many times more
comfortable than they.
They sell what little earthly pos¬
sessions they have to pay for their
passage south—chickens, pigs piec¬
es of jewelry, and other things that
they do not immediately need.
Whatever remains of their belong¬
ings they pack up—and frequentiy
a handkerchief can accommodate
all of them.
Aboard the ship they do not
grumble. They eat whatever feed
they are given, without any mur¬
mur. They do not care for to-day;
their eyes and hearts are set for
the morrow.
They vary in ages, these seekers
of a new life: from the baby
suckling at the breast of its mother


to the old man feeble in his six-
ties. The baby is unconscious of
the long journey; the old man is
conscious of it but is full of regret
that he is no longer young. He
looks at his stalwart sons who are
bringing him with them to the
scuth, looks at their set faces and
brawny arms. And he knows they
will succeed.
Bewildered Strangers
Arriving in the strange land,
with no acquaintances except their
fellow-passengers, they are bewild-
ered, not knowing what to do,
where to go. There are young girls
with them who have either run
away from their homes or been in¬


veigled to come to the south by pro¬
fessional procurers. These young
girs are virtually sold to house¬
keepers, Japanese refreshment par¬
lor operators mostly, and to people
who initiate them into the oldest
profession in the world. Practical¬
ly no protection is afforded them
by any Christian individual or
group of individuals. Nor, for that
matter, the government.
The young men with their fami¬
lies, who had hoped to acquire
lands for homesteads, soon realize
that the nearest available plot of
land for homesteading purposes is
several days’ journey by foot to the
interior wilds where scattered  abo¬
rigines still roam.. It would take
a we'ponimaad narty to reach these
hemestead lands.
It is no wonder, therefore, that
many of these adventurers decide
to stick to the towns near the port,
fearing the dangers that await
them in their trek to the interior.
They are made to be'ieve that tran¬
sactions with the government al¬
ways are uncertain affairs and at
times err on the wrong side. All of
which they do not understand, yet
believe, being simple folk. So they
stay in towns where they feel safer.

However, there are always a few
indomitable souls who having
ventured this far south, wou'd not
be put off. They blaze trails to the

United States, contains the follow¬
ing editorial comment about Dr.
Sobrepena.
"Front-rank personality among
leaders of Asia’s life to-day is En¬
rique Sobrepena, D. D., Moderator
of the United Evangelical Church
of the Philippines from the begin

able administrator and organizer,
remarkable preacher. He is the pro¬
duct of the Phi ippines-United
States Christian education, Maca¬
lester Co lege, Princeton, and Drew
Seminaries graduated him. Having
organized the Church of the Filipi¬


nos in Brooklyn, Dr. Sobrepena was
its pastor until 1926 when he
returned to the Philippines... Mo¬
derator Sobrepena is also a recog¬
nized leader in statesmanship and
education. Last year, his fellow ci¬
tizens made him a member of the
new Commonwealth constitutional
convention. A trustee of the Pres¬
byterian Sil iman University by vir¬
tue of his Presbyterian moderato¬
rial office, since a year ago in
March he has worn the honor of a
doctor of divinity degree from the
Baptist Central Philippine College.


Dr. Enrique C. Sobrepena
Well-Anown Preacher And Educator


To be honored with a doctorate
degree (honorary) twice in about a
year’s time is a distinction which
Rev. Enrique C. Sobrepena can
proudly claim. After receiving the
honorary degree of Doctor of Di¬
vinity from the Central Philippine
College last March, 1935, at its
commencement exercises held in
connection with the ce'ebration of
the 30th anniversary of its found¬
ing, Dr. Sobrepena has been noti¬
fied recently that the board of
trustees of the Macalester College
of Minnesota has decided to confer
upon Dr. Sobrepena a similar
honor.
Dr. Sobrepena was born in
Bauang, La Union, on March 2,


1899. He is the only child of Juan
Sobrepena, an officer in the Philip¬
pine revolutionary army, and Ana¬
tolia Calica, of Bauang.
He studied in the primary and
elementary schools of his home town,
and in the provincial high school,
San Fernando, La Union. Sobre¬
pena was not able to finish his se
condary course as he was appointed
pensionado of the Bureau of Lands
and sent to Manila to study survey¬
ing. At that time, the Bureau of
Lands was selecting pensionados
from the different high schools of
the country and being one
of the brightest lads in the
La Union High School, So¬
5i
brepena obtained the Bu¬
reau of Lands scholarship
without much effort.
He studied surveying as
a government pensionado
in the Philippine School of
Arts and Trades and was
granted his certificate as
surveyor in 1918.
From 1918 to 1920, So¬
brepena worked as sur¬
veyor of the Bureau of
Lands in compliance with
an agreement entered into
between himself and that
bureau before he was ap¬
pointed pensionado. He was
stationed at various places
together with surveying
parties.
In 1920, he resigned
from the bureau and with
the litt'e money he had
saved as surveyor, bought
a third class passenger
ticket from a local steam¬
ship company. His resour
ces brought him as far as
St. Paul, Minnesota, U. S.,
where he worked his way
through college by working,
first as waiter in a Chinese
restaurant and later as
dishwasher. He studied in
the Macalester College, an
outstanding Presbyterian
college, and obtained his
A.B. degree in 1920. Be¬
fore his graduation, how¬
ever, the chief of the highway de¬
partment of the State of Minnesota
heard of the young surveyor from
the Philippines and offered him a
job as draftsman. Interest in the
Filipino surveyor was, however
heightened by the fact that the
chief of the state highway depart¬
ment and Sobrepena were attend¬
ing the same church.
In 1921, Sobrepena entered the
graduate school of Princeton Uni¬
versity and studied philosophy and
theology. During the two years he
was at Princeton, he copped the
first ten places in scholarship. At
Princeton, as in Macalester, Sobre¬
pena was active in extra curricular
activities. In both institutions, he


won oratorical honors and was
made member of such well-known
national forensic fraternities as
Pi Kappa Delta and Delta Sigma
Rho.
After the church was established,
Sobrepena found it difficult to con¬
tinue attending his classes at
Princeton and transferred to Drew
University, which is nearer his
New York city church than Prince¬
ton. In 1926, he was granted his
B.D. degree. He returned to the
Philippines a few months after
his graduation and was appointed
pastor of the United Church. He
holds the position up to the present
time. The church will soon receive
a P200,000 donation from a wealthy
American lady who died in the Uni¬
ted States a few months ago.
In 1927, when a union of all Pres¬
byterian, Congregational and Uni¬
ted Brethren churches were effect-
ed, Sobrepena was elected General
Moderator. The union is now known
as the United Evangelical Church
of the Philippines, the biggest pro¬
testant denomination in the Philip-
pines to-day. He was re-elected
General Moderator for the fourth
time recently.
He was sent as delegate of the
Protestant churches of the Philip-
pines to the international Mission¬
ary Council which was held in 1931
in Hernnhut, Germany. He return¬
ed home from that meet through
Russia, Manchuria, and Siberia.
When the board of trustees of
the Union Teological Seminary de¬
cided recently to strengthen its col¬
legiate department, they elected Dr.
Sobrepena as president of the
Union College.
Dr. Sobrepena was a delegate to
the constitutional convention and
was candidate for a seat in the first
National Assembly but was defeat¬
ed by Assemblyman Yaranon.
He married the former Miss Pe¬
tra Aguinaldo in Brooklyn, New
York, in 1925, and has four child¬
ren; Enrique, Jr., 10; Aida, 7;
Juan Augusto, 5; and David, 3.
Residence: 750 Lepanto, Manila.

have started calling him Don), who
now owns three automobiles and
goes around with bodyguards,
begged for loans with which to re¬
pair his shaky nipa shack.

N the fifth day of her week’s
stay in Alcala; Gracia woke
O up almost before it was really
morning. The mist showed through
the half-open window: a sort of
grey-blue haze that hung over the
trees and the smaller houses, almost
completely shutting away the
vague outlines of the hills beyond.
And when she rose there was sud-
denly the embrace of intense cold-
ness.
Like the coldness of that
first morning when she stumbled
upon Baket Ana.
Gracia slid back on her bed and
closed her eyes. How quaint and
strange the little bent figure had
seemed, plodding her way through
the morning stillness, a shawl
thrown across her shoulders and her
hair so tightly drawn back. At first
she hadn’t known. That there was
somebody e’se as she ran up the
slope on numb feet. Like a little
child she had knelt on the wet grass
and picked up the thin sheets of
frozen dew that were like ice.
Her uncle had told her about that,
about the frozen dew of the North
that was like ice. Now that she had
been allowed to come up all the way
from the city, that had been the
first impulse: to run up the slope
and see for herself and feel the
strangeness of frozen dew. And
when she looked up, there was Ba¬
ket Ana: a thin, shriveled, twisted
old woman hugging a worn basket
and peering at her kneeling there
on the wet grass of the slope.
She smiled reminiscently at the
memory of those furrowed eyes.
There was not a glint of harm in
them except the piercing, searching
look that had frightened a little.
They were so like those of a wicked
fairy’s! But that was only on the
first day of her coming. The follow¬
ing mornings she had risen early
and watched by her window to see
the lifting of the morning mist and
the coming to life of the hills be¬
yond. Only, there was never any
Baket Ana again.
Last night, entertaining a few
young people, she heard them talk¬


ing. She knew it was about Baket
Ana because someone uttered the
name but what it was they said she
could not understand. When she
asked, her uncle was evasive, unlike
that first time when she wanted
to know who the woman of the slope
was. But she had forgotten easily,
occupying herself with the thin
young man who, of all her new
friends, had failed to be aroused by
her light-heartedness. And this
morning, the memory came only
very faintly because the lifting of
the morning mist was beautiful still
as she lay watching it thin into


nothing through half-closed eyes.


CROSS the broad expanse of
A green, Gracia’s laughter drift-
ed: a lilting sort of laughter that
rang pleasantly above the trotting
of the horses on the road. The few
others who had come to watch the
sunset from the hilltops straggled
on ahead or far behind. Beside her,
Anching kept pace, the brim of his
hat shading his deeply sombre eyes
from the sun. She had liked An¬
ching from the very first, in spite
of his sullenness that night of her
party. But it was a different kind


of liking. Like liking a little boy
because he struck you as so pitifully
fatherless and motherless and be¬
cause the unhappiness showed too
much in his eyes. He had not want-
ed to come that morning, they said,
for some vague reason. But he had
to come because her Uncle couldn’t.
That was why Gracia tried to be
pleasant as they cantered on through
the dust of the highway.
Quietly, Gracia urged her horse
on, the silence unbroken for a while
except for the steady beating of
horse feet and the answering
crackle of twigs underneath and
rustling leaves overhead. Then on a
little knoll way up, they stopped.
As her eyes, used to the crowding
in the city, swept in the sight, her
heartbeats quickened. Somehow,
the view reminded her of a toy town
nestling at the foot of a toy moun¬
tain with a little blue sea lapping
ever so gently the feet of little red
and green and white houses huddled
like little children. Turning to her
companion she pointed at the trees
be.Ow.
“Look—they seem so small from
here! Almost like the potted ferns
we have at home....
Amused, Anching smiled. He help-
ed her dismount. They sat down and
together they started picking out
the places she knew. There was
the school building: a tiny red
square with the wriggling bit of
flag on top, and there was her Un¬
cle’s house—green and white in
the waning sunlight. Then there
was a deserted barn and farther
away a slope. Suddenly she remem¬
bered. The slope. Baket Ana. With
an eager look she faced Anching.
"Do you know” she said, “the
first day I came, I met someone
there—someone old and quaint and
bent on the slope there—there...
she pointed with her finger at the
place where the green and
white house stood proudly. She did
not see, as she pointed, the flush
that suddenly colored Anching’s
face. She only felt the dismissal
in his voice as she turned to face

him.
Gracia suddenly felt angry, angry
at her Uncle and at Anching and
all the rest. To her intelligent mind
it was plain now that there was a
mystery somewhere. But that was
not enough. She wanted enlighten¬
ment and for some reason it was not
to be had. With an angry shrug
of her shoulders she rose. But he
did not. He remained sitting with
his back to a tree, gazing at the
village below. And in his deeply
sombre eyes, the unhappiness was
struggling in vain against expres¬
sion.
"Im sorry—but even you would
not understand....
Gracia’s heart quickly went out to
Anching. But somehow it was too
deep for her. This all-enveloping sad-
ness that seemed to have stolen all
the sunshine and the laughter that
should have been tumbling out of
his eyes and his mouth. It was so
painful to stand there watching, she
wanted to tell him to run away from
it. From whatever it was, as she
would have done. He must have
read her thoughts because he said:
"But you would not run away
from it—unless you were a co¬
ward...
All the good-natured sophistica¬
tion in her slipped away. There was
something profound and heartbreak¬
ingly meaningful in what this young
man from the hills was saying.
The sun was turning crimson,


sending gold-tipped flashes across
the sky. In a little while more it
would hang low, so low,—a full red
orb on fire, then it would be gone
leaving only faint splashes of pink
across the grey.
They mounted their horses and
slowly turned to meet the stragg¬
lers. On the way, she rode ahead,
but at the foot of the last hill, he
was beside her. Impulsive’y she
held out her hand. It touched his
but his eyes kept ahead and only a
sad smile tinged his lips.
“There is only death, and even
that, one must not wish...
She, riding full gallop was not
to forget that for the rest of her
life.


N a speeding train that was
the end of a completely new
y vacation, Gracia sat looking
out at the blurred green of the
trees that ran away so swiftly as
the train rolled on and on farther
away from the toy town nestling
against the toy mountain with the
little blue sea lapping ever so gent¬
ly the feet of the red and white
and grey houses. There was a book
on her lap but it lay unopened.
She was thinking of someone who
with her had gazed at the village
below from a knoll way up—with
unseeing eyes. Also of that sick-
ening last night when she had
watched the men carrying their

Everybody talks war, war, and
more war.... so this writer, not to
be outdone nor outmoded, will also
indulge in this latest of pastimes
and ram a few slants on war, down
your throat.
A nation gets overcrowded and
for want of more land, goes out and
beats the living daylights out of a
weaker nation.
Now, a nation is composed of in¬
dividuals. Take for instance, a
farmer. A farmer finds that his
farm is overcrowded with his fam-
ily or livestock and what does he
do? He doesn’t go out, grab him¬
self a shotgun and blast away at
his neighbor farmer! Instead, he
peacefully and amicably sees his
neighbor and dickers with him
about his farm, in a business-like
manner. A price is agreed upon, he
pays it (somehow) and in turn,
gets the deed to the farm.
Why can’t nations do likewise?
Isn’t this the most logical thing to
do? Is there a law prohibiting
such transactions? If Japan, Mus¬
solini, Hitler, et al, would only be
farmers for a spell and do what
our simple farmer did, not a drop of
human blood would be shed, not a
woman widowed, not a child or¬


phaned, not a nation ruined, not a
world saddened, and this would be
a more pleasant world in which to
live, for you and you and you....
and me, too!

Why is the so-called Davao
problem of such importance that
no less than the President had
to make a special trip to that
province to see what could be
done concerning the matter? Is
it because, among other things,
the natives are not getting their
proper share of the province's
chief industry? The following
article is very enlightening as to
the position of Filipinos in the
abaca industry in Davao.


BACA is grown in 31 prov¬
inces of the Philippines,
A
but seven provinces—Albay,


Camarines Sur, Davao, Leyte, Sa¬
mar, Sorsogon, and Surigao
—stand out prominently as the
major abaca-producing areas. They
represent 84 per cent of the total
abaca acreage of the Islands. Of
the seven, Davao takes the lead
not only in area but also in the
average production per hectare.
Of the total Philippine production
in 1932, 30 per cent was grown in
Davao alone.
Several factors make Davao the
leading abaca region in the Islands.
One of these is the fact that nature
has liberally endowed the province
with a loose, cool, extremely rich soil


Shown above are the different steps in
the preparation of abaca for export.
stripping (top), drying (eenter), and bal¬
ing (bottom).
which is suited to the growth of
abaca plants from the stalks of
which are stripped the fibers now
in great demand in the world mar¬
ket. Asc, Davao has an abundant
rainfall uniformly distributed
throughout the year—a facton
which is very significant as fibrous
plants require continuous watering
during their life-growth. And ano¬
ther thing, Davao, particularly the
Gulf region, the center of the aba¬
ca industry, is seldom if ever visitec
by devastating typhoons, a misfor¬
tune which frequently visits the
other abaca-producing areas of the
country. Protected from the south-
west moonsoon by Mt. Apo in the
South and by its subsidiary moun¬
tain ranges in the West; shielded
from the northeast moonsoon by a
series of unbroken mountain ranges
which separate the province from
Agusan in the North and from Su¬
rigao in the East, Davao is topogra¬
phically wal ed by natural barriers
which render the province inacces¬
sible to disastrous storms. With
these advantages, Davao cannot but
be the premier abaca-producing
spet in the Philippines.
The process of producing the fi¬


bers for foreign exportation is
technically divided into two distinct
phases. The first which may be de¬
signated the plantation work con¬
sists of abaca plant cultivation and
fiber stripping. Stripping is still
largely done by hand, but in re¬
moving the bagasse from the hand-
stripped “taxis," spind e machines
are now employed. Each of these
machines is provided with a serrated
knife that insures a uniform and
perfect cleaning and a low-powered,
internal-combustion engine replac¬
ing the human power in drawing
out the fibers. Not long ago, how-
ever, an improvement in the me¬
thod of hemp-stripping in Davao
was introduced. Two modern strip-
ping machines or decorticators, the
only ones of their kind in the
Islands, are now in use. One was
installed by the Japanese in the Fu¬
rukawa plantation at Daliao and
the other by the International Har¬
vester company in the Odell planta¬
tion at Madaum. The new wonder¬
ful machine is a triumph of modern
industrial engineering. Within less
than an hour of operation, fibers
which were once the stalk of the
growing abaca come out of its
steam-heated drier.
In preparing the fibers for the
world market the second phase of
the work in the abaca industry be¬
gins. The work is mostly done in
the warehouses or "bodegas” of the
commercial firms that handle the
abaca foreign trade. The fibers
bought from abaca plantation own¬
ers and farmers are carefully
cleaned, the colored or damaged
tips or ends removed to insure uni¬
formity in color. Then a rigid pro¬
cess of cassification and grading
in conformity with government
standard grades takes place after
which the graded fibers are baled,
—only one grade of fibers in each
bale—with the aid of a powerful
pressing machine. After being pro¬
perly tagged and marked according
to government baling, tagging, and
marking regulations, the bales are
now inspected by government fiber
inspectors. When approved, a cer¬
tificate of inspection is issued in
which case the bales are ready for
foreign shipment. But in case of
rejection or disapproval by reason
of mixed grades the baled fibers
are re-classified and re-graded, in
which case re-baling, re-tagging,
and re-marking are necessary.
The steps taken by the insular
government in establishing fiber
standard grades and maintaining a
fiber inspection service are protec¬
tive both to the native producers
and the foreign buyers. By the
use of official standards in grading
the fibers, a uniformity in the
grades of Philippine fibers through-
out the Islands is realized; and
through the supervision of, and cer¬
tification by the fiber inspection
board the confidence of foreign buy¬
ers in Philippine fibers is secured.
Competitors of Philippine fibers
have tried in vain to undersell or

There is now a way to restore the
natural whiteness and brilliance to
your teeth. It is called the Kolynos
method.
All you do is put just a half-inch
of Kolynos on a dry brush. Quickly
the antiseptic Kolynos foam reaches
every tiny crevice and fissure. Mil¬
lions of germs that cause stain, dis¬


coloration and decay are destroyed
and washed away. Soon your teeth
lose their dullness. Natural white¬
ness and brilliance are restored-your
mouth feels clean and refreshed.
Try Kolynos. Use it morning and
night and you will be delighted and
amazed at what it does.

AOURRRRMS RARARN


Part I: THE LADIES
By A. E. LITIATCO


N American editor once
asked Loreto Paras Sulit:
A“How did you learn to
write?” And she, revising a dis¬
tinguished predecessor, replied:
“By reading."
Asked the same question, many
a writer might well give the
same answer. For more than any
other, the scribe is marked—or
marred—by what he reads as well
as writes. If, to illustrate, one is
acquainted not only with James
Branch Cabell but with Ellen
G asgow, he will the better under¬
stand why he dedicated “Some¬
thing About Eve” to her while
she inscribed “They Stooped to
Folly” to him: it was a case of
one mind saluting its peer.


This is why your writer, for one.
has always been interested in "au¬
thors’ authors.” And hence did he
ask several of the local ladies and
lords of the quill to list their fa¬
vorite authors for him....
Y IGAYA VICTORIO REYES,
 formerly of The Tribune and
1now with The Young Citizen,
writes feature articles, essays, vers¬
es, skits, and — most notably -
stories. After defining favorite
writers as “those authors who have
never let me down, those whom I


can read again and again and ad¬
mire and love as many times—those
whose very names are promises of
something good to come and lasting
memories of something good,” she
proceeds to give this Roll of Ho¬
nor:
“1. Dorothy Thomas. Her stories
have such an essence of quiet na¬
ture, of things growing, of things
moving without disturbing the
peace of the earth. In them, feel¬
ing flows with calm beauty, like a
tide subdued by a master hand to
an even, unobtrusive strength. Hers
is a simplicity that is rich—if sim-
plicity and richness ever were blend¬
ed.
“2. Elizabeth Madox Roberts.
She has a distinctive way of por¬
traying characters whom she ob¬
viously understands. She lapses in¬
to the pcetic in her descriptions of
places, people, emotions, without
causing spectacular vibrations: so
quietly, so casually, does she do it.
Her dialogues are maneuvered so
ingeniously that you don’t realize
they have that much meaning until
you close the story. Greatness lurks
within her simplest tales, and beau¬
ty is there with a disarming simpli¬
city.
“3. Wilbur Daniel Steele. His sto¬
ries are rich in undercurrents.
There is an intensity about his
style which makes one think of one
word—power. His technique is
among the most finished that I have
come acress, his climaxes are per¬
fect—he can tell a story most in¬
terestingly.
“A. Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
What I have read of her poetry is
so feminine. A bit sentimental—
but that was what poetry was
meant to be, I suppose. I like read¬
ing her because I like to imagine


that I can feel as much as she does
about certain things. After digest-
ing one of her ‘'Sonnets from the
Portuguese,' I feel that I have con¬
tributed to the passion of the world.
“5. Dorothy Parker. She is so
amusing, her wit brittle and bril-
liant—like well-polished glass. She
always interests me.
“6. Joseph Conrad. Because he
is always amazing. The richness of
his vocabulary is rare even among
truly English authors. He can
make atmosphere something that is
real and all-pervading—maintains a
distinct tone of emotion and paints
a portrait with consistence.
“7. J. M. Barrie. I love his whim¬
sy. Reading him, one comes across
a personality who can be old and
young at will; who can be humor-
ous or ironic and still be an idealist.
He makes believing in fairies such
a beautiful thing.
“I hear a small voice saying that
I have been unfair in mentioning so
few of the authors I like, but I had
better stop: I don’t want to flood
you with my raves. I also have so
many potential favorites—writers
whom I have not read enough to
know very well but whom I might
admire tremendously if given a
chance. But enough, enough...."
TRRINIDAD L. TARROSA, es¬
A sayist, story-teller, and one of
our foremost poets, finds her¬
self confronted with a difficulty
which, as you will note, also beset
other lady contributors to this sym-
posium. She would not commit her-
self beyond saying: “My line-up of
favorites changes every so often—
in fact, every time I discover a new
delight—that’s how fickle I am. I
may say, however, that Edna St.


Vincent Millay is never erased from
my varying lists.”
NGELA MANALANG GLO-
ARIA, formerly literary edit-
or of the Herald and another
of our leading poets, ventures a lit¬
tle farther: “Who are my favorite
authors? Let me see—there’s the
Bible, then Shakespeare (the more
I read him, the more I’m convinced
of his matchless genius), Elinor
Wylie for the poetry of the head,
Sara Teasdale for the poetry of the
heart, Edna St. Vincent Millay (of
course), Thornton Wilder for his
incomparable 'Bridge of San Luis
Rey,' Wilbur Daniel Steele (remem¬
ber 'Footfalls'?), Tennyson, etc..
etc. But why talk about favorites?

SUNCION LOPEZ, essayist
Aand quondam associate editor
of The Woman’s World, states with
characteristic humor:
“I suppose
Im just one of the 'eternal femi¬
nine gushers. I love, simply love,
most authors. Now I read Hugo
and Maupassant, and like them; to¬
morrow I go ‘gaga’ over Scott and
Winston Churchill.
“I’m ashamed to confess—no I’m
not—though some friends declare I
should be, that I enjoy Wodehouse
and Graeme and Sarah Lorimer for
the simple reason that they make
me laugh, and I love laughing.
"Sigrid Undset, Willa Cather,
Charlotte Bronte, and George Eliot
I admire and would like to imitate.
"Farnol, Sabatini, Baroness
Orczy, and the like I read when I
am in what you might call a rom¬
antic mood. I have a weakness for
those times when men were gentle¬
men and women were ladies...
“Galsworthy, Dickens, and Char¬
les Morgan I read at times to bring
me back to earth. Also Dumas,
though he depresses me, and Poe,
even if he gives me the shivers!
“I can’t seem to remember whom
I like more than Barrie, Mark
Twain, and O. Henry. And I al¬
most forgot Booth Tarkington, my
first love.
“Do you realize now how hard it
is for me to pick my favorite writ¬
ers? It all depends on my mood for
the day—no wonder I am so fickle!
Yet, perhaps I am not, after all: for
I like them all at the same time...

Topics, is not only a noteworthy
short-story writer but can also turn
out poems, essays, and feature art¬
icles. She says that she likes:
“Rupert Brooke—for his sheer,
inescapable poetry, animated by the
spirit of youth and a keen passion
for living. For an artist’s matur¬
ity, not so much of subject, for he
is often more clever than wise, but
of style and technique. And for
his exquisite feeling for words. 
ani particularly fond of that excit¬
ing lift, that 'soar’ in his lines, and
that effective sudden drop in his
last stanzas. I never can read him
silently.
“Christopher Morley—for that
quiet, chuckling irrepressible vein
of humor lurking in his poems, es¬
says, short stories, and novels. For
that love of life he has of a stuff
akin to Brooke’s but of a temper
different. Because where Brooke


sees high white radiances, Morley
catches the gleam; and were Brooke
is intoxicated with living, Morley
is the connoisseur who tastes and
enjoys its separate properties. Also
for his happy phrasing.
“Morley Callaghan—for his open
flowing, unobstructed narrative
style.
P G. Wodehouse—for his fresh,
genteel, original, and irresistible
clowning.
Lewis Carroll—for "Alice in
Wonderland."
G. K. Chesterton—for the fact


that with three others (Maupas¬
sant, Flaubert, and Chekhov), he
has survived my adolescence and
such former flames as Edna Fer¬
ber, Booth Tarkington, Rafael Saba¬
tini, et al.
“Dorothy Parker—(as everybody
does) for her remarkable wit.
“Emily Dickinson—for those lit¬
tle verses which are elementary in
construction, but startingly gen¬
uine poetry.
"Dora Aydelotte—for her rollick-
ing, kindly-humored, small town¬
flavored short stories.


“I wanted to mention ten at least,
although if you should count Ches¬
terton’s three companions I have
listed twelve; but I felt that it
wouldn’t be quite fair to the others
I will omit, as I like them also
equally well. Actually I have very
few author favorites—but many
favorite individual poems, short
stories, essays, and novels.
“So that this list is merely arbit-
rary. I like Katharine Brush too
and Tess Slesinger and once even
Saroyan, and then Dorothy Thomas.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
On the hour set for the funeral of Harold
Monkhouse, his mourners: his widow, Barba¬
ra; Madeline Norris, a member of the house
hold; his secretary, Wallingford; and Rupert
Mayfield, are informed by a police sergeant
that the funeral has been ordered postponed
by the coroner who has issued summons to
the members of the Monkhouse household t
be present at the inquest. It is revealed
the inquest by experts consulted by the Rev
Amos Monkhouse, brother of the dead man
that the deceased has died of arsenic poison¬
ing and not from the ailment which had con¬
fined Harold Monkhouse to bed as an inva¬
lid. It is revealed that the invalid’s bottle ol
medicine contains arsenic and that previous
to his death Harold Monkhouse was for :
long time suffering from arsenic poisoning¬
There is strong suspicion from evidence se
far revealed in the inquest that the man has
been poisoned. But how, and by whom?
Dr. Dimsdale, the Monkhouse family phy¬
sician, Mrs. Monkhouse, and Miss Madeline
Norris who lives with the Monkhouses are
made to testify at the inquest. Dr. Dims dale
is positive the arsenic which killed the in¬
valid did not come from the medicine he pre
pared for the sick man. Mrs. Monkhouse
states that her husband’s relapses invariably
occurred when she was away. Miss Norris
who teaches cooking and prepared the food
of the invalid most of the time fails, in her
testimonv, to give a clue as to how the ar¬
senic which killed Harold Monkhouse was ad¬
ministered.


Chapter VI
THE VERDICT
— had not been taking much no¬
tice of Wallingford, my atten¬
Ation being occupied with the
two women when it strayed from
the proceedings Beyond an irri¬
tated consciousness of his usual
restless movements, I had no infor
mation as to how the soul-shaking
incidents of this appalling day


were affecting him. But when he
rose drunkenly and, grasping the
back of his chair, rolled his eyes
wildly round the Court, I realized
that there were breakers ahead.
When I say that he rose drunk¬
enly, I use the word advisedly
Familiar as I was with his peculiar¬
ities—his jerkings, twitchings and
grimacings—I saw, at once, that
there was something unusual both
in his face and in his bearing; a
dull wildness of expression and an
uncertainty of movement that I had
never observed before. He had not
come to the Court with the rest of
us, preferring, for some reason, to
come alone. And I now suspected
that he had taken the opportunity
to fortify himself on the way.
I was not the only observer of
his condition. As he walked, with
deliberate care, from his seat to the
table, I noticed the coroner eyeing
him critically and the jury exchang¬
ing dubious glances and whispered
comments. He made a bad start by
dropping the book on the floor and
sniggering nervously as he stopped
to pick it up; and I could see plain¬
ly, by the stiffness of the coroner’s
manner that he had made an un¬
favourable impression before he be¬
gan his evidence.
“You were secretary to the de¬
ceased?” said the coroner, when the
witness had stated his name, age
(33) and occupation. "What was
the nature of your duties?
“The ordinary duties of a secret
ary,” was the dogged reply.
"Will you kindly give us parti¬
culars of what you did for de¬
ceased?"
“I opened his business letters
and answered them and some of his
private ones. And I kept his ac¬
counts and paid his bills.
“What accounts would those be
Deceased was not in business, I un¬
derstand?"
“No, they were his domestic ac¬
counts; his income from invest¬
ments and rents and his expendi¬
ture.

personally; I mean in the way of

looking after his bodily comfort
and supplying his needs?
“I used to look in on him from
time to time to see if he wanted
anything done. But it wasn’t my
business to wait on him. I was his
secretary, not his valet.
"Who did wait on him, and at¬
tend to his wants?
“The housemaid, chiefly, and
Miss Norris, and of course, Mrs.
Monkhouse. But he didn’t usually
want much but his food, his med-
icine, a few books from the library
and a supply of candles for his
lamp. His bell-push was connected
with a bell in my room at night,
but he never rang it."
“Then, practically the housemaid
did everything for him?'
"Not everything. Miss Norris
cooked most of his meals, we all
used to give him his medicine, I
used to put out his books and keep
his fountain pen filled, and Mrs.
Monkhouse kept his candle-box sup¬
plied. That was what he was most
particular about as he slept badly
and used to read at night."
“You give us the impression, Mr.
Wallingford,” the coroner said,
dryly, “that you must have had a
good deal of leisure.
“Then I have glven you the
wrong impression. I was kept con¬
stantly on the go, doing jobs, pay
ing tradesmen, shopping and run¬
ning errands.
"For whom?'
“Everybody Deceased, Mrs.
Monkhouse, Miss Norris and even
Dr. Dimsdale. I was everybody’s
servant.
“What did you do for Mrs. Monk¬
house?”
“I don’t see what that has got
to do with this inquest?'
“That is not for you to decide,
"You
the coroner said, sternly.
will be good enough to answer my
question.
Wallingford winced as if he had
his ears cuffed. In a moment, his
insolence evaporated and I could
see his hands shaking as he, evid-
ently, cudgelled his brains for a re¬
ply. Suddenly he seemed to have


struck an idea.
"Shopping of various kinds,
said he: “for instance, there were
the candles for deceased. His lamp
was of German make and English
lamp-candles wouldn’t fit it. So I
used to have to go to a German
shop at Sparrow Corner by the To¬
wer, to get packets of Schneider’s
stearine candles. That took about
half a day."
The coroner, stolidly and without
comment, wrote down the answer,
but my experience as a counsel told
me that it had been a dummy ques¬
tion, asked to distract the witness’s
attention and cover a more signific¬
ant one that was to follow For
that question I waited expectantly.
and when it came my surmise was
confirmed.
And Dr. Dimsdale? What did
you have to do for him?'
“I used to help him with his books
sometimes when he hadn’t got a
dispenser. I am a pretty good ac¬
countant and he isn’t.
“Where does Dr. Dimsdale do his
bookkeeping?
"At the desk in the surgery."
“And is that where you used to
work?”
“Yes."
“Used Dr Dimsdale to work
with you or did you do the books
by yourself?
“I usually worked by myself.”

FrV HERE is the everlasting dai¬
liness of marriage. To see
L the same face at bed and at
board, to see it at getting up and
at lying down, to see it tired and
il-humored as well as fresh and
cheerful, to see it painted and pow¬
dered for public exhibition and
sallow and lined for private, to see
it at dinner when you want diver¬
sion and amusement, and again at
breakfast when you are out of hu¬
mor and want to see nothing at all.
The continual familiarity is more
than human nature can stand; it
causes married couples to treat one
another with a rudeness which they
would never dream of extending to
their most casual acquaintances. It
leads them to appear before each
other in postures and attires which
they would sooner die than reveal
to their neighbors—the mere sight
of his wife cutting her toenai's in
a dressing gown and curl-papers
has killed the love of many a good
man.—C. E. M. Joad.

Soybean acreage rose in U.S.
from 2,000,000 acres in 1924 to
nearly 5,000000 in 1935; produc¬
tion increased over the same period
from 5,000,000 to more than 40,-
000,000 bushels. Some reasons for
this increase are: immunity of soys
to chinch bugs and other pests,
good prices, drought resistance, and
high seed yield. The soybean is
now used for food, plastics, live¬

We wonder what Manila Po ice
Chief Torres, the city fiscal’s
office, and our courts have to
say about this:
Each year, an average of 3,000
prostitutes come before the New
York City Women’s Day Court,
chief'y charged with disorderly con-
duct. Although prostitution is not
a criminal offense, prostitutes are
finger-printed and otherwise treat¬
ed as criminals. Since the depres¬
sion, there has been a marked in¬
crease in the number of Negro pro¬
stitutes. Few of the women escape
venereal infection for more than a
year; they are committed for hos-

pital treatment only if active infec¬

pital receives them; it accommo¬

armed guards.—The Nation.
Prostitution here is an offense
punishable under the Revised Pena
Code, but we catch only a few of
this species of city residents.
If ever there was a hero whose
heroism goes unrecorded and unre¬
warded it is the trawlerman. There


was one who, when the boat he was
on went aground off Iceland, actual¬
ly punged into the icy sea and
swam a quarter of a mile to shore
with a line. For this heroic feat
a dinner was held in his honour at
which he was to be presented a me¬
dal for bravery.
But he never turned up at the
dinner, nor would he accept the me¬
dal. That is the trawlerman all
over. It was just his job, he said,
and he wanted no medal for doing
it!—A. Harvey Bailey.
And a great many of us here
wear medals simply for the joy
of wearing an item that perhaps
carries no background of merit
at all.

“I am told that a certain nursery
school, whose teachers are all un¬
married, went to visit a farm and
arrived just in time to admire a
new calf. One of the children asked
the farmer where he got it, and he
—well, he didn’t know. On the way
back the subject came up for the
first time, but no teacher felt up
to it at the moment and so it passed.
After school they consulted; the
matter must be explained to the
children—very bad to avoid it—but
who would explain? Finally they
arranged with one of the mothers
who had lived on a farm to explain
it. Next morning she did so in full,
to a group of intently listening
children. As soon as she was
through, one little fellow heaved a
sigh of relief, 'Oh, he said, 'just
like people!' and with agreeing
nods the children were off to re¬
sume their play.”—Rhoda W. Bac¬
meister. s *
The amateur travel er recounting
his experiences is a first-class bore.
With his sheaf of snapshots, his
banal impressions, above all, his de¬
sire to let the world know that he
has Been Abroad This Summer, he
cannot be otherwise than the most
avoidable occupant of the hotel
lounge.
—Pamela Frankau.
We have them here, too, and
plenty more would be returning
after the summer is over!
Agnes Rothery, after a trip to
Finland: “Watch a housewife at
her routine morning tasks. How
she wipes and polishes and rubs the
floors and doors, the sil’s and ceil¬
ings, the rungs of the chairs, and
the legs of tables! Watch a woman
in some primitive house or even
out of doors beside a lake: boiling,
rinsing, bleaching every napkin,
sheet and towel—every garment,
rug, and scrap of cloth she can pile
into her great basket, into her iron
kettle hanging over the fire! There
is no shirking here.
No, our college-graduate house¬
wives leave everything to the
hired he p. If they did not there'd
be no time for cold cream, lip
sticks, and nail polishings.
Graduates looking for jobs
listen: “What does commerce want


from the college man?....Execu¬
tives at present, if indeed they ever
did, do not want the star athlete,
the social light or the most popu ar
man in his class, as such. Even the
college man per se doesn’t mean a
whole lot. This may seem contrary
to the general public’s idea, but it
is the inside fact."—William L.
Fletcher, Boston expert on jobs.
In the final analysis, therefore,
a college degree will avail you
nothing if you are an ass to start
with and remained on in spite of
four years in college.
Newest careerist: The hired girl
has "dropped her pail and broom,
gone to training schcol, and return¬
ed a certified 'household employee"
with definite ideas on child psycholo¬
gy and even more different opinions
on the status of her work."
N. Y. Times.

Do you complain about not hav¬
ing any employment? You need
not complain if you have imagin¬
ation. Example: “An unemployed
man was wandering through a
churchyard when he noticed that
many of the tombstones were badly
begrimed with dirt, their inscrip-
tions practical'y unreadable.
“He got an obliging chemist to
make up a solution—costing a few
pence—which would remove the
grime and restore the tombstones to
something like their original state.
Then he went to the vicar, who in¬
troduced him to peop'e willing for
him to renovate tombstones of their
dear ones.
“Though only working three or
four hours a day, this man was soon
making over L2 ($10) a week, while
when one churchyard was completed
there were always others waiting
his attention. —Pearson’s Weekly.
If yow say, "But there are no
tombstones worth the trouble of
cleaning in my town, we give up.

Are Yon Flat.Chested?
If your chest is flat, you prob¬
ably are more intelligent than that
fellow with the deep chest. From
studies of several thousand adults
and school children, Dr. S. A. Weis¬
man of the University of Minnesota
concludes that flat-chested persons
not on'y average more intelligent
than the full-chested, but are taller
and heavier. In earlier surveys Dr.
Wiesman found that, contrary to
popular belief, flat chests are not
an evidence of tuberculosis, but that
deep-chested individuals are more
prone to the disease.

RARRUNE
MAIAN


r AY showers have awakened
Ithe greenery from long
slumber. Color has return¬
ed again.
And like May you should be color¬
ful. Hence prints have become a
large part of the picture. They ap-
pear in dots, squares, flowers, and
many other dainty and unique de¬
signs. But always select your prints
for the color of its background:
navy and bright blues, black, brown
rust, wine, green, red beige, leather¬
brown, purple, are among the im¬
portant colors. Bright shades for
those gifted with a peach-and-cream
comp exion, and the dull or toned¬
down colors for the darker.
When your day’s program may
run into a luncheon or tea, start
out in a print dress. You will like
it with broad revers and skirt pleats
and a white vestee that buttons up
to suit your convenience. White is
for accent and it suggests coolness,
besides.
Norfolk dress suits in plain or
checkered linen with dark accesso¬


ries are very popular in the city.
Tailored cuts have a definite appeal
all year 'round, you know.
Organdie a’so can do wonders.
Made into a blouse, collar, cuffs
and sleeves, it can make you look
very pretty and chic. Use in some
kind of trimming, “trencillas,” for
instance.
For tucked-in blouses select a
lighter shade of the same color as
the skirt. If you have a flair for
contrasts, be more careful with your
color selections. With any skirt, a
flesh colored or white blouse is
always safer—no one will raise an
eyebrow.
Stockings are almost invariably
beige; the smartest shade is light
rust-beige.
And don’t forget the shoes:
they always show off and either
rob a dress or the wearer of her
charm or enhance it. The latest
for everyday wear has these fea-
tures: dark heels, punchwork, a
neat suede bow, scallop over the
instep, and back swoops down be¬
low your shinbone. Exciting enough


that way but the real excitement
usually lies on the toe-part—it is
nowhere to be found and in its
stead would be the real live ones.
They can stay quiet when comfort-
able.
Sun-burst pleats streaming down
a plain white chiffon gown as in
cape-like or wing-like effect done
on the same material or on tulle
looks lovely on anybody. Sheer
materia’s treated in a similiar man¬
ner always catch the breath-
sort of.
Fruits have comfortably placed
themselves on milady’s shoulders.
Just as violets have also dared blos¬
som on her head. You might like
that sense of daring, if only to go
with Spring.
All roads lead to Antipolo these
blessed weeks for many many rea¬
sons. And should you be consider¬
ing to follow the current, look over
your wardrobe and include the fol¬
lowing if you don’t find them tuck-
ed in somewhere: a plain pinok-pok
skirt done in p'eats or a flared jusi
with tri-toned color stripes (be
particular about color combina¬
tions): a camisa matching the
design which may be repeated on
the tapis (natural native motifs
like “planting rice" or "on a banca
by the river;" a pair of zapatillas
and a bag to match—those done in
abaca are not as elegant as the
beaded ones but are just as pretty.
Another just-the-right-thing for
a warm evening is lace in slim sil¬
houette with flounces of tulle cir¬
cling down and over the hips in a
graceful line and accentuating the
sheath-like lace mo ding the figure.
Belts have become wider and of-
ten draped, looking like crushed
girdles and nearly reaching the
hip-line. A bolero jacket of a con¬
trasting color for emphasis and
effect.
Always suit your own type, be
it may, June or December. Fashion


recognizes a veritab'e assortment
of new old things from lapels, but-
tonaires, vestees, and men’s worst-
eds to flowers, capes, trimmings
and lace.
And don’t forget—have a little
cosmetic urge, ladies. Just ever so
little.

RECIPES
TUTTI FRUTTI
Select a fairly large pine¬
apple; cut off the ton smooth;
scoop out the inside, being care¬
ful not to break the sides of the
fruit. Dice the pulp and mix
with it half as much orange.
Add one dozen maraschino
cherries and a few teaspoons of
mild liquor like Cherry Brandy.
Stuff the pineapple with this
mixture and set in a cool place
until ready to serve. Place the
top with a tuft of leaves on it
to give an appearance of whole¬
ness and wholesomeness.
DUHAT JELLY
Select fruit that is just ripe.
Sort and wash; add enough
water barely to cover the fruit;
cook until soft. Then pour into
the jelly bag and strain into an
enamelled vessel. Do not
squeeze the bag. Boil the juice
for thirty minutes and measure:
1 cup of sugar to each cup of
juice; 2 tablespoons of lemon
juice to every 4 cups of duhat
juice. Stir until the sugar dis¬
solves. Cook for ten minutes.
As soon as it jellies, pour into
a sterilized vessel and seal.
CAMIAS JAM
Wash the camias; remove the
stems and spots. Put the fruit
in a kettle with a little water;
boil until soft. Remove from
the fire; press through a coland¬
er. Measure the pulp: to ench
cup add 144 teaspoon baking
soda and 1 cup of granulated
sugar. Return to the fire; boil
until thick. Seal in small steril¬
ized jar and keep in a dark, dry
place.

alone in the surgery?”
“Yes, usually."
As the coroner wrote down the
answer I noticed the super-intel¬
ligent juryman fidgeting in his
seat. At length he burst out:
“Is the poison cupboard in the
surgery?
The coroner looked interroga¬
tively at Wallingford, who stared at
him blankly in sudden confusion.
“You heard the question? Is the
poison cupboard there?
"I don’t know. It may be. It
wasn’t any business of mine.
"Is there any cupboard in the
surgery? You must know that."
“Yes, there is a cupboard there,
but I don’t know what is in it."
"Did you never see it open?”
“No. Never.
"And you never had the curiosity
to look into it?
"Of course I didn’t. Besides I
couldn't. It was locked."
"Was it always locked when you
were there?
“Yes, always."
“Are you certain of that?”
“Yes, perfectly certain."
Here the super-intelligent juror
looked as if he were about to
spring across the table as he
demanded eagerly:


“How does th
wvitness know that
that cupboard was locked?
The coroner looked slightly an¬
noyed. He had been playing his
fish carefully and was in no wise
helped by this rude jerk of the line.
Nevertheless, he laid down his pen
and looked expectantly at the wit¬
ness. As for Wallingford, he was
struck speechless. Apparently his
rather muddled brain had suddenly
taken in the import of the ques¬
tion, for he stood with dropped jaw
and damp, pallid face, staring at
the juryman in utter consternation.
“Well,” said the coroner, after an
interval, "how did you know that it
was locked?”
Wallingford pulled himself to¬
gether by an effort and replied:


"Why, I knew—I knew, of course,
that it must be locked."
“Yes; but the question is, how
did you know?”
"Why it stands to reason that it
must have been locked."
“Why does it stand to reason?
Cupboards are not always locked.
Poison cupboards are. Besides
you heard Dimsdale say that he al¬
ways kept this cupboard locked. He
showed you the key."
Once more the coroner, having
noted the answer, laid down his pen
and looked steadily at the witness.
"Now, Mr. Wallingford,” said
he, “I must caution you to be care¬
ful as to what you say. This is
a serious matter, and you are giv¬
ing evidence on oath. You said


just now that you did not know
whether the poison cupboard was
or was not in the surgery. You
said that you did not know what
was in that cupboard. Now you
say that you knew the cupboard
must have been locked because it
was the poison cupboard. Then it
seems that you did know that it
was the poison cupboard. Isn’t
that so?
"No. I didn’t know then. I do
now because I heard Dimsdale say
that it was."
“Then, you said that you were
perfectly certain that the cupboard
was always locked whenever you
were working there.
That meant
that you knew positively, as a fact,
that it was locked. Now you say
that you knew that it must be
locked. But that is an assumption,
an opinion, a belief. Now, a man
of your education must know the
difference between a mere belief
and actual knowledge. Will you,
please, answer definitely: Did you,
or did you not, know as a fact
whether that cupboard was or was
not locked?”
“Well, I didn’t actually know, but
I took it for granted that it was
locked."
“You did not try the door?”
“Certainly not. Why should I?”
“Very well. Does any gentleman
of the jury wish to ask any further
questions about this cupboard?”
There was a brief silence. Then
the foreman said:
“We should like the witness to
say what he means and not keep
contradicting himself.”
“You hear that, Sir,” said the co¬
roner. "Please be more careful in
your answers in future. Now,
want to ask you about the last bot-
tle of medicine. Did you notice
anything unusual in its appear¬
ance?
“No. I didn’t notice it at all. I
didn’t know that it had come.

on that day—the Wednesday?”
'Yes, I went to see deceased in
the morning about ten o’clock and

ing about nine o’clock to see if he
wanted anything, but he didn’t.”
"Did you give him any medicine
then?”
“No. It was not due for another
hour."
"What was his condition then?”
“He looked about the same as
usual. He seemed inclined to dose,
so I did not stay long."
“Is that the last time you saw
him alive?
“No. I looked in again just be¬
fore eleven. He was then in much
the same state—rather drowsy—
and, at his request, I turned out
the gas and left him.
"Did you light the candle?”
“No, he always did that himself,
if he wanted it."
"Did you give him any med¬
icine?”
“No. He had just had a dose.
"Did he tell you that he had?”
“No. I could see that there was
a dose gone."
“From which bottle was that?”
“There was only one bottle there.
It must have been the new bottle,
as only one dose had been taken."
“What colour was the medicine?”
Wallingford hesitated a moment
or two as if suspecting a trap. Then
he replied, deggedly: "I don’t know
I told you I didn’t notice it.”
“You said that you didn’t notice
it at all and didn’t know that it
had come. Now you say that you
observed that only one dose had
been taken from it and that you in¬
ferred that it was the new bottle.
Which of those statements is the
true one?"
“They are both true," Walling¬
ford protested in a whining tone.
“I meant that I didn’t notice the
medicine particularly and that I
didn’t know when it came.”
“That is not what you said,” the
coroner rejoined. "However, we
will let that pass. Is there any
thing more that you wish to ask
this witness, gentlemen? If not,
we will release him and take the
evidence of Mr. Mayfield."
I think the jury would have liked
to bait Wallingford but apparently
could not think of any suitable
questions. But they watched him
malevolently as he added his—prob¬
ably quite illegible—signature to his


depositions and followed him with
their eyes as he tottered shakily
back to his seat. Immediately
afterwards my name was called and
I took my place at the table, not
without a slight degree of nervous¬
ness; for, though I was well enough
used to examinations, it was in the
capacity of examiner, not of wit¬
ness, and I was fully alive to the
possibility of certain pitfalls which
the coroner might, if he were wide
enough awake, dig for me. How¬
ever, when I had been sworn and
had given my particulars (Rupert
Mayfield, 35, Barrister-at-Law, of
No. 64 Fig Tree Court, Inner Tem¬
ple) the coroner’s conciliatory man¬
ner led me to hope that it would be
all plain sailing.
"How long have you known de¬
ceased?” was the first question.
About two and a half years,” I
replied.
"You are one of the executors of
his will, Mrs. Monkhouse has told
us."
“Yes."

tral’s premises.
Mr. Henares explained to Pre¬
sident Quezon that waste products
of the sugar industry are turned in¬
to useful commodities, thereby
creating new industries for the em¬
ployment of many laborers. “You
are doing a great work, exclaimed
Pres. Quezon in sincere praise.
The manufacture of the M-C al¬
cohol stoves was also looked into
carefully. The Montilla stoves are
designed to nationalize the use of
alcohol, create a country-wide de¬
mand for this fuel, and thus en¬
courage the establishment of alco¬
hol distilleries in the Philippines.
Alcohol is a good substitute for ga¬
soline and crude oils, now widely
used in lighting systems, transpor¬
tation facilities and factories.
Mr. Henares explained that if
there would be 1,000,000 homes us¬
ing alcohol in the kitchen at an
average daily consumption of one
half gallon per home, 500,000 gal¬
lons of alcohol would be used every
day or around 180,000,000 gallons


a year. This consumption will mean
100 busy distilleries turning out
5,000 gallons a day. Priced at P0.25
a gallon, the alcohol industry will
mean P45,000,000 circulating income
for the Philippines.
Aside from the financial angle,


the establishment of alcohol distille¬
ries here will mean work and sub¬
sistence for thousands of Filipino
laborers in distilleries and planta¬
tions where the raw materials are
produced.

The Whole Truth
Dean Gabino Tabunar, expressing
himself in "Leaky Educational Sys¬
tem," published in  's
March 26th issue, told the plain
truth when he revealed there is
"so much centralization in instruc¬
tion, so much dictation, made man¬
ifest even in inconsequential de¬
tails, that faculty initiative be¬
comes not only curtailed but also
prevented, discouraged and, in the
end, destroyed by disuse." Thou¬
sands of public school teachers
would like to add: “....and too
much exploitation, too much bos¬
sing, too much kuskos-balungos!"
I know of one supervising teach¬
er who has only venom for subor¬
dinates who do not dress well. Once
he scolded a maestro for not wear¬
ing his tie at an ordinary teachers"
meeting! Another supervising head
devotes more time to checking up
personal neatness of teachers, clean¬
liness of rooms and schoolgrounds
rather than helping teachers in the
latter’s struggle for teaching effi¬
ciency.
The situation in the barrio school
is worse. Equipments such as
sign markers, hyloplates, supple¬
mentary readers, etc., are deliber¬
ately concentrated in the central
schools, just to make a great im¬
pression on educational gods who
might make surprise visits. The
barrio teacher is forgotten, and left
to struggle as best he could against
handicaps. All he gets are worn
readers and "overworked" hylo¬
plates.
There is the persistent feeling of
insecurity in their positions. They
know that just one word, "ineffi¬
cient,” will drop them from the
service. And incurring the dis¬
pleasure of a supervising teacher is
often marked down as insubordina¬
tion and inefficiency.
Teachers must buy dolls and mi¬
niature objects to help children with
daily lessons. So also with the
seat-work devices, flower pots, pro¬
fessional reading matters, wearing
decent clothes. But just how much
do teachers receive?

False Alarm
The information furnished by
Mr. Gonzalo M. Pelayo in “Strange
Facts The Mail Brings,” which ap-
peared in  ’s April 16th
issue, to the effect that there are
three times more women than men
in the municipality of Makato, Ca¬
piz, is false. None of the towns of
Capiz have their women outnumber¬
ing the men, much less in Malmo,
where boys are more nainr
than girls.
The trouble with him was ihat
wanting to see his name in prin: I
went ahead with his conclusic
without at all consulting the Mak
to municipal treasurer who woule
have gladly furnished him with the


records of births, marriages, and
deaths, from which he could have
based his sex ratios.
Mr. Pelayo is a teacher by voca¬
tion, yet it is to be regretted that
he is doing his best to give the read-
ing public wrong ideas and notions
about persons and places he is writ¬
ing about.

Taxi Dancers In Barrios
Almost all barrios in Mandawe
(Cebu), my home town, are run¬
ning miniature cabarets. Asked
about these commercial dance halls,
the barrio people reply: "Why,
these are National Defense bene¬
fits.” They further add: “The
councilors have told us these
things are all right.
But these “benefit" dances have
been going on for nearly three
months now, and their growth has
been very rapid. They are not for¬
mal affairs, though. They are held
under mango trees, or where there
is enough space to dance around.
The number of bailarinas has in¬
creased and these girls, being of
loose dispositions, are undermining
the morals of young men here.
Even minors are learning to min¬
gle with them by dancing with them
during cabaret hours.
Now I ask: Where are the social
workers of Mandawe? Why don’t
they do something to wipe out these
cabarets run nightly under the
guise of National Defense dance
benefits?
Through the   I wish to
make it known to the Mandawe mu¬
nicipal authorities that some of the
town’s morally-spirited citizens are
aware that law and order here are
not functioning properly.

For Equal Distribution
It is to be noted with satisfac-
tion that agrarian questionnaires
have been distributed to some Lu¬
zon and Visayan provinces, and
that not only prominent provincial
agriculturists but also teachers
were given the privilege of an¬
swering them.
I would suggest, nevertheless,
that those questionnaires be not
distributed only to those provinces.
Such would tend to regional limita¬
tions, whereas the better plan would
be to distribute them throughout
the Philippines. We know that
agrarian troubles are found not
only in some central Luzon and
Visayan provinces, but nearly in
all parts of the Archipelago wher¬
ever agriculture is carried on.

Sonnets
I
I am in love with high far-seeing places
That look on plains half-sunlight and half-storm,
In love with hours when from the circling faces
Veils pass, and laughing fellowship glows warm.
You who look on me with grave eyes where rapture
And April love of living burn confessed¬
The Gods are good! the world lies free to capture!
Life has no walls. Oh, take me to your breast!
Take me—be with me for a moment’s span!
I am in love with all unveiled faces.
I seek the wonder at the heart of man;
I would go up to the far-seeing places.
While youth is ours, turn toward me for a space
The marvel of your rapture-lighted face!
II
Come forth, for Spring is singing in the boughs
Of every white and tremulous apple-tree.
This is the season of eternal vows;
Yet what are vows that they should solace me?
For on the winds wild loveliness is crying,
And in all flowers wild joy its present worth
Proclaims, as from the dying to the dying-
“Seize, clasp thy hour of sun upon the earth.”
O never dream that fire or beauty stays
More than one April moment in its flight
Toward regions where the sea-drift of all days
Sinks in a vast, desireless, lonely night.
Away with eternal vows,—and give me breath
Of one white hour here on the marge of death.

She could see the thing again: a
life ess inert mass of clotted blood.
How queer it was now that no re¬
volting shiver should oppress her,
knowing that the lifeless heap had
been Baket Ana! Then above every¬
thing, above the confusion
his
face again—Anching’s face: quiet
and white, staring into the half-
darkness. So still. Then her Un-
cle had taken her away. And in
that fleeting last glance she had
seen Anching’s face buried in his
hands and somehow, everything be¬
came clear and lucid and—tears
leaping into her eyes—she had run
away.


In the waning sunlight she could
see Baket Ana as young, wistful,
and convalescent. Then unfeeling
with the shock of Death taking
away her newborn. And at last her
young eyes giving way to an un¬
belief. Her child could not have
died. But they could have stolen
her, the baby girl whose hands had
held hers for only a short tiny while.
Maybe they had hidden her away
in the mountain where she must
find her. Soon.
People around fe’t a sudden pain¬
ful tug when they saw her: thin.
spent, and unfeeling — walking
about, looking for the daughter she
had lost. And Anching, the boy
whose mind had been bewildered by
a mother who was there and yet
so far away, had become Anching
the youth whose heart ached se
futilely for the mother who was
insane.
Gracia rose from her seat. He
had said there was only Death.
Death had come, merciful and quick.
Would it mean happiness for the
sombre-eyed youth? Would it mean
laughter tumbling out of the pain¬
wracked heart? or an eternal
conscience knocking because of a
vague utter half-wish? Her lips,
soft and red in the twilight, quiv-
ered.
The shadows across the sky had
thickened and very soon it would be
dead—the rushing living green of
the trees. And tomorrow, there
would be the lifting of the morning
mist again.

WHAT OUR WRITERS.
I
Continued from page 2.3


There are three women writers I
watch these days. Tess Slesinger,
Dorcthy Thomas, and Dora Ayde
lotte. I always turn to their page
when I see their names on the table
of contents, but I can’t call the first
two, favorites yet. Although I en¬
joy them very well.
“I always read Pare Lorentz and
George Jean Nathan when I can,
but they are not favorites although
I admire their excellences. Neithel
is Don Marquis, and it is not be¬
cause I have no sympathies with
cleverness, either, as I do like Do¬
rothy Parker.
“I can always remember what
pleasure it was reading "Old Wives"
Tale’ without even thinking of Ar¬
nold Bennett. And "Pride and Pre¬
judice’ apart from Jane Austen...
LAUDIA M. CRUZ, for the last
three years an important fac¬
tor in the success of the U P
Writers’ Club activities, writes com¬
mendable stories and essays. Her
favorite writers, according to her,
are:
“Engene O'Neill. He’s modern¬
supremely. But he’s sensitive too
—so very keenly sensitive. He can
be human and tender and Leautiful
and exquisite—all of romance with¬
out the gush—until he makes me
cry Honest! And I love him for
it. I wish I could read him oftener
and more. 'Anna Christie’—no
remance here; but how infinitely
touching! I read it three times,
and I could read it three times
more. ‘Strange Interlude’ I read
seven times! And each time, I cried
anew Foolish, isn’t it? Exceed¬
ingly, hopelessly so! But I don’t
care!
"Pearl Buck. I met her in 'East
Wind: West Wind.' Her pale lotus
flowers and ‘moon-doorways’ ap¬
pealed to me, I suppose. I do hate
eastern catering to western dot¬
ings on things Oriental, but Pearl
Buck is not like that—not even in
“East Wind,' which now, after years,


FEELS like a fairy tale. Perhaps,
she may have wanted to—her books
may sell because of those dotings
of the West; but she writes in such
a way that she positively does not
cater. EWWW is light and with
no unusual subject matter. But its
author sounds so sincere, you take
it all in as though it were all fresh
and new... Then I read ‘The Good
Earth. After that, I was all for
her. No soft, pale moonlights here
Just plain, plain earth. Life—peo¬
ple—persons. Hard, solid earth—
soft, sweet, fresh earth—starved,
dry, barrent dust. That book is
real! It touches deeply even if it
is about strangers. Of the Chinese,
and yet you understand...
“Oscar Wilde. Yes, the infamous
Wilde. Infamous? Not when he can
give us such a jewel as ‘De Profun¬
dis. I don’t care what his life was:
I shall always like him, if only fon
De Profundis' and even without
Salome' (no gush here now minc
you!) is divine—utterly I wish
someone would picture it (on the
stage or on the screen) in all its
delicate, stark loveliness. Yes,
stark but still delicate... There are
two other Wilde plays I’ve read-
the Fan play and the Earnest play.
Delicious! I just chuckle all through
them every time I read them. And
I’ve read them so many times that
I’ve lost count. They refresh so¬
the wit simply scintillates, bristles
sparkles... And there is one Wilde
tale I treasure. You guessed it¬
‘The Nightingale and the Rose. I
first heard it recited on the radio
(recorded program, not local) be¬
fore I read it—maybe that is why
the impression seems so much more
vivid than it might have been...
“W. Somerset Maugham. I met
him first in his essays. His case
captured me. There is such a lovely
comfortableness in his gait, such a
restful, cozy freedom about it that
won me completely. Then I read
"Of Human Bondage. It was a sur¬
prise—and much more an addec
pleasure! I don’t think I can do
justice to that book with one read¬


ing. It is so immense—even if it
is really of one human life alone.
For it tells so much: one needs to
read it repeatedly to realize fully
what it would say. I saw the film
version. Awful! No, don’t misun¬
derstand me: Leslie Howard and
Bette Davis were superb. But A
wanted so much more—the picture
seemed so incomplete. It felt like
a mere chapter out of that whole
miserable life that was so bondaged
from the very start...
We wish we could relay the rea¬
sens why Miss Cruz did not list
Lewis, Mencken, Dreiser, Heming
way Tolstoy, and Dostoievsky: it
would be so interesting. But even
her remarks about the authors she
prefers we have had to abbreviate
somewhat as a concession to that
constant and implacable foe, Space
—or lack of it.

‘I am an old friend of Mrs
Monkhouse. I have known her

“The gress value of the estate is
about fifty-five theusand pounds,
of which twelve thousand represents

“Do you know of any fact or cir¬
cumstance which, in your opinion,
ought to be communicated to this
Court or which might help the jury
in arriving at their verdict?
"No, I do not.
This brought my examination to
an end. I was succeeded by the
cook and the kitchen-maid, but, as
they had little to tell, and that lit
tle entirely negative, their examin¬
ation was quite brief. When the
last witness was dismissed, the cor¬
oner addressed the jury.
“We have now gentlemen, saic
he, “heard all the evidence that is
at present available, and we have
the choice of two courses; which
are, either to adjourn the inquiry
until further evidence is available.
or to find a verdict on the evidence
which we have heard. I incline
strongly to the latter plan. We are
now in a position to answer the
questions, how, when and where
the deceased came by his death
and when we have done that, we
shall have discharged our proper
function. What is your feeling on
the matter, gentlemen?
The jury’s feeling was very ob¬
viously that they wished to get the
inquiry over and go about their
business, and when they had made
this clear, the coroner proceeded to
sum up.
“I shall not detain you, gentle¬
men, with a long address. All that
is necessary is for me to recapitu¬
late the evidence very briefly and
point out the bearing of it.
"First as to the cause of death
It has been given in evidence by
two fully qualified and expert wit¬
nesses that deceased died from the
effects of poisoning by arsenic.
That is a matter of fact which is
not disputed and which you must
accept, unless you have any reasons
for rejecting their testimony, which
I feel sure you have not. Accept
ing the fact of death by poison, the
question then arises as to how the
poison came to be taken by the de
ceased. There are three possibili¬
ties. he may have taken it himself,
voluntarily and knowingly; he may
have taken it by accident or mis¬
chance; or it may nave been ad¬
ministered to him knowingly, and
malicicusly by some other person on
persons. Let us consider those
three possibilities.
“The suggestion that deceased
might have taken the poison volun¬
tarily is highly improbable in three
respects. First, since deceased was
mostly bed-ridden. it would have
been almost impossible for him to
have obtained the poison. Second,
there is the nature of the poison.
Arsenic has often been used for ho¬
micidal poisoning but seldom for
suicide; for an excellent reason.
The properties of arsenic which
commend it to poisoners—its com¬
plete freedom from taste and the
indefinite symptoms that it pro¬
duces—do not commend it to the
suicide. He has no need to concea.
either the administration or its
results. His principal need is ra¬


pidity of effect. But arsenic is a
relatively slow poison and one which
usually causes great suffering. It
is not at all suited to the suicide.
Then there is the third objection
that the mode of administration
was quite unlike that of a suicide.
For the latter usually takes his poi¬
son in one large dose, to get the
business over: but here it was evi¬
dently given in repeated small doses
over a period that may have been
anything from a week to a year.
And, finally, there is not a parti¬
cle of evidence in favour of the
supposition that deceased took the
poison himself.
“To take the second case, that
of accident: the only possibility
known to us is that of a mistake in
dispensing the medicine. But the
evidence of Dr. Dimsdale and Miss
Norris must have convinced you
that the improbability of a mistake
is so great as to be practically
negligible. Of course, the poison
might have found its way acciden¬
tally into the medicine or the food
or both in some manner unknown
to us. But while we admit this,
we have, in fact, to form our de
cision on what is known to us, not
what is conceivable but unknown.
“When we come to the third pos¬
sibi'ity, that the poison was admi¬
nistered to deceased by some other
person or persons with intent to
compass his death, we find it sup¬
ported by positive evidence. There
is the bottle of medicine for in¬
stance. It contained a large quan¬
tity of arsenic in a soluble form.
But two witnesses have sworn that
it could not have contained, and, in
fact, did not contain that quantity
of arsenic when it left Dr. Dims¬
dale’s surgery or when it was de¬
livered at deceased
use. More¬

e. She

dence in our possession is to the ef¬
fect that at six o’clock in the after¬
noon, that bottle of medicine did
not contain more than a drachm¬
about a teaspoonful—of Liquor
Arsenicalis; whereas at half-past
ten, when a dose from the bottle
was given to deceased by the house
maid, it contained some three oun
ces—about six tablespoonfuls. This
is proved by the discovery of the
poison in the stomach of deceased
and by the exact analysis of the
centents of the bottle. It follows
that, between six o’clock and half-
past ten, a large quantity of arsen¬
ical solution must have been put in¬
to the bottle. It is impossible to
suppose that it could have got in by
accident. Somebody must have put
it in; and the only conceivable ob¬
ject that the person could have hac
in putting that poison into the bot
tle would be to cause the death of
deceased.

QUESTIONS:—For services ren¬
dered, A, before her death and thru
a public document, donated a par¬
cel of land to D.
A, being ill, simply affixed her
thumbmark. B and C, A’s nephew
and niece and only heirs, were pre
sent when the instrument of don¬
ation was drawn up B signed as
witness. D, ignorant, did not
transfer the property in his name.
Years later, after donor A and
donee B’s demise, C wanted to get
the donated land now in possession
of D’s heirs. Is the instrument of
donation valid although A only used
her thumbmark? Can C have the
right to take back the donated land?
—Dominador G. Florida, Dumalag
Capiz.
ANSWERS:—For donation of
real property to be valid, it must
be made by public instrument
duly registered, in which the pro¬
perty donated must be specifical
ly described and the amount of the
incumbrances to be assumed by
the donee expressed.
Again, there must be specific
acceptance, made in the deed of
gift or in a separate public instru¬
ment. Acceptance produces no
effect if not made during the
donor’s lifetime. If acceptance
was made in a separate instru¬
ment, notice thereof should ba
given the donor, and this proceed
ing should also be noted in both
instruments.
D, not having made a formal
acceptance, lost his rights to the
donation. However, if ten years
had already passed, D’s heirs may
possibly claim the land by pres¬
cription.—Answered by Atty. Isi¬

ANSWERS:—Persons to be eli¬
gible for nomination as cadets
under this Act must be: Unmar
ried and without dependents, (b.
not less than 18 nor more than 24
years old on date of appointment,
(c) Physically fit for constabula¬

or other higher institute approved
by the government, and (e) Of
excellent reputation.
The Department of Military
Science & Tactics. U. P., is also

ity.—Editor.
QUESTION:—What is the best
way of tanning hides?—Carlos S.
Ganzon, Kabankalan, Occ. Negros.
ANSWER:—The best way of
tanning is to immerse the hides
first in liquors containing one¬
half per cent of tannin, and
gradually changing the hides to
stronger liquors until the last con¬
tains ten or fifteen per cent of
tannin, the process lasting at
Jeast four months. Under no cir¬
cumstances should the hides be
put into a liquor of about one per
cent strength at the beginning,
nor should the strength of the li¬
quor be allowed to decrease at
any moment at the end of a month
or six weeks, the hides are more
pickled than tanned, and are con¬
sequently much less valuable. If
during the process of tanning the
pelts in the pith feel slippery,
more ground bark and some car¬
bolic acid should be added in or¬
der to arrest putrefaction.—Ans¬

QUESTION:—Can a home eco¬
nomics graduate of a secondary
school take up the normal course?
—I. A. Amparado, P. O. Box 120,
Iloilo.
ANSWER:—A home economics
graduate of a secondary school
can take the home economics
curriculum in the Philippine Nor¬
mal School. Two curricula are
previded: (1) a two-year course
providing for specialization in
home economics and (2) a two¬
and-a-half-year curricu'um called
the combined curriculum which
covers all of the subiects of the
home economics curriculum and
the additional ones of the acade¬
mie curriculum. Heretofore, in
all provincial normal schools, a
secondary course could take the
provincial normal curriculum com¬
pleting the additienal subjects
required for graduation in one
year and a half.—Answered by

QUESTION:—I have been suf-
fering from headache since I was
in the third year in the high
school. Now I am in the fourth
year and still I am unrelieved of
the ailment. It has given me
sleepless nights. Usually I feel it
most severe at the eleventh hour
during the day and up to mid¬
night. I have tried numerous re¬
medies. At present I am taking
medicine (nervous system reg¬
ulator) but despite my efforts to
abide with the doctor’s advice
still I feel the ailment as severe
as before. Will you kindly tell me
the best treatment for it?—Lupo
Pabillion, Cotabato, Cotabato.
ANSWER:—You are advised to
seek admission to the Cotabato
Public Hospital for proper diag¬
nosis and treament. Your case
cannot be wise’y treated by mail.
You need to be seen and treated
by a local physician who can

QUESTIONS:—Is diabetes mel¬
litus considered under control
when the urine is sugar-free? This
taking up of dose causes weak¬
ness in my limbs, and excessive
perspiration. What harm may
come to me, if I keep close to any
diet? Is smoking more harmful to
a diabetic person than to a normal
one?—An Inquirer, Manila.
ANSWERS:—The mere fact
that the urine is free from sugar
does not mean that the diabetes
is under control. The blood sugar
is the criterion to be considered.
The experience described is not
an uncommon one. This has hap-
pened fairly frequently to pa
tients using insulin. Physicians
warn such patients that they
must continue under the observa¬
tion and supervision of their
physician until such a time a they
are ordered to discontinue by the


physician himself. Other factors
not connected with diet, may pro¬
duce the symptoms described since
the appetite at times demands a
greater amount of sugar than at
other times. Periods of emotion
and stress may be an example.
Whether smoking is more harm¬
ful to a diabetic person than to
others should be answered by
the phy sician who has ex
amined the patient. This should
be the procedure in all cases,
since this question cannot be
answered in the same way for
every person nor in the same way
for the sa me person.—From

“But further; the evidence of the
medical witnesres proves that arse¬
nic had been taken by deceased on
several previous occasions. That, in
fact, he had been tak’ng arsenic in
relatively small doses for some time
past—how long we do not know—and
had been suffering from chronic ar¬
senical pcisoning. The evidence,
therefore, points very strongly and
definitely to the conclusion that
some person or persons had been
for some unascertained time past,
administering arsenic to him.
"Finally, as to the identity of the
person or persons who administered
the poi:on, I need not point out that
we have no evidence. You will have
noticed that a number of persons
benefit in a pecuniary sense by de¬
ceased’s death. But that fact estab¬
lishes no suspicion against any of
them in the absence of positive evi¬
dence; and there is no positive evi¬
dence connecting any one of them
with the administration of the poi¬


son. With these remarks, gentle¬
men, I eave you to consider the evi¬
dence and agree upon your decision.
The jury did not take long in ar¬
riving at their verdict. After a few
minutes’ eager discussion, the fore¬
man announced that they had come
to an unanimous decision.
And what is the decision upon
which you have agreed?” the coro¬
ner asked.
“We find,” was the reply, "that
deceased died from the effects of
arsenic, administered to him by
some persen or persons unknown,

“Yes,” said the coroner; “that is,
in effect, a verdict of wilful mur¬

unknown. I agree with you entire¬

OPINION


Ideal Supcrvisor
The ideal supervisor is one who
is a source of inspiration. He is a
progressive leader and able orga¬
nizer. He counsels like a father,
suggests, guides, and cooperates. He
does not boss, is not servile to his
superiors. He is tactful and is not
hogtied by conventions and tradi¬
tions. He is not partial and dces
not place any value on inf uence. He
has vision and is not a hypocrite.

In Praise of Barrio Teachers
The belief that the barrio teacher
is neglectful and lazy and ineffi¬
cient is unjust. The barrio teacher
does not only discharge his school
work efficiently but also attends to
extra-curricular activities. To


quete J. Scott McCormick: “As a
ru e many citizens seldom think
of the school as having an influence
beyond the three R’s.... The aver¬
age person can never realize what
an important place the barrio teach¬
er holds in the development of the
welfare of the people.... To the

Not Enough Reading Materials
Fi ipino educators have been cri¬
ticized for their failure to read wide¬
ly along lines that will help them in
their profession. American teach¬
ers, on the other hand, have been
lauded and extolled as voracious
readers.
Questions have been
raised as to why Filipino teachers


read less than their American col¬
leagues.
It is not really indo'ence that is
back of the failure of Filipino
teachers to avail themselves of
more reading materials than they
are doing at present. The more im¬
portant reason is the unavailability
of reading matter. In the United
States reading matter can be had
at reasonable
prices as compared
with the prohibitive prices of the
same reading materials. In the
United States, also, libraries are
found everywhere. In the Philip-
pines only a few towns boast of
branch libraries.

As If Nothing Had Happened
By MISAEL HISITA MELLA


WAS out of breath when I
reached the hospital that after¬
 noon, twilight rather. Mount-
ing the stairs of the building that
smelled of medicines, I encountered
a nurse and I asked her if I could
visit a friend brought there three
days ago.
The nurse nodded vaguely, and
scon I found myse’f among the sick
and the convales:ents. I was chat¬
ting gaily with some friends, when
I noticed that one of the patients
was lying very still on her bed.
thought she was asleep but her eyes


were open and staring fixedly at
the ceiling. She was breathing ra¬
pidly.
A nurse entered and walked be¬
side this patient’s bed. She expert-
ly held the patient’s pale wrist, con¬
sulted her watch. She produced a
thermometer and got her tempera¬
ture. She brought out a hypoder¬
mic needle and shot an injection
through the patient’s skin.
The nurse motioned to another
nurse and pretty soon two hot-wa¬
ter bags were brought in and plac¬
ed on the patient’s breast. The doc
tor soon entered, fe t the pulse too.
There was no emotion betrayed by
his face as he went out.
The rest of the patients in the
room had stopped chattering and
were looking on with strained ex¬
pressions. The two nurses put cur¬
tains around the bed of the patient
I could not guess what was going
on inside the white enclosure. All
that I saw were the vague shadows
of hands moving swiftly back and
forth. Then the activity inside the
curtained bed ceased abruptly.
One of the nurses went out. We
searched for some expression on
her face but found none. She went
to one of the patients and asked
in a very low voice: “Did she have
any suitcase with her when she


came here with you?”
“Yes, Ma’am, she had one."
“May I have one of her dresses?”
Everything went on smoothly.
Like a well-oiled machine that did


not have any soul. After several
hours a little disturbance happened
in the room, but this did not con¬
cern the personuel of the hospital.


Watchful Waiting
By F. MIRANDA


—y E stood behind the gumamela
clumps fringing the sidewalk.
A
He was waiting for her, and
she knew it the moment she saw
him from the opposite side of the
street. She crossed the street. He
looked at her with eagerness in his
young face.
Should she walk past him as if
she did not know he was there, or
shculd she look up abruptly, regis¬
ter surprise, then smile slowly,
sweetly, and say, “Hello. I did not
see you"?
She walked ahead and she sensed,
with feminine delight, his disap-
peintment. When she had gone a
few paces, she strained her ears for


the sound of his footsteps. There
was none. What could be delaying
him? Maybe she was walking too
fast for him to catch up. With a pang
she remembered that he had writ¬
ten her sometime ago about his
spraining an anke during a game
of basketba’l. Her face softened and
she slackened her pace. She was soon
walking almost leisurely.
She thought of his clean, strong,
boyish profile; of his uncertain
smile; and of his charmingly un¬
ruly hair. And then she thought of
herself. She wondered if he thought
her pretty. Did she look lovely
from the back? She wished she had
a waist slimmer than her twenty¬
four inches. As slim as Sonia’s
twenty-two-inch waist, for example.
Was he looking at her? She want¬
ed to know but she dared not look
back. She walked very slowly this
time. She again listened for the
sound of footsteps. None. She was
getting impatient. What was the
matter with him? Why, avan a
lame person could catch a¬


one walking as slowly as she did.
“If he does not walk faster, I will."
He must know that she had never
waited for any boy—they had al¬
ways waited for her. “Well, Mr.
Salas, I cannot wait for you, any
longer.” With a toss of her dark
head, she took big, rapid strides.
For a moment she was really angry.
But when she thought: if I do
not wait, I shall not be able to talk
with him. She wanted to see him
locking down at her, to fee! his dark
eycs searching her face. She would
make him smile in that uncertain
way of his.
She would not wait for him! Let
him catch up. If he really loved
her as he said he did, he would
want to talk with her. Or did
he... Furious at the thought that
she had to give in, she looked back
rcluctantiy. In an instant her ex¬
pression changed; the frown dis¬
appeared. Nobody was following
her, for the boy, hurt by her having
ignored him, felt he could no longer
keep up, what with his paining
ankle. He had not minded it at
first. He was sure she saw him.
Slowly, he had walked away, pain¬
ful disappointment clouding his
young face. And she? She walked
kome the rest of the way with the
same expression of disappointment.

tenant Wil'iam Lee, U. S. A., as¬
signed chief of the P. A. air force,
took the plane up for test flights.
Lieutenant Lee flew the plane
over Camp Murphy, put it to a
series of tests, and came down per¬
fectly satisfied with the way the
plane worked. High Philippine
Army officials including Brigadier
General Basilio Valdes and Major
M. Olympia witnessed the test
flights. It was said afterwards
that another plane might soon be
ordered from the United States to

Fortunately, dear lady, your case

common. For the woman who has
an oily skin, there is nothing finer
than Astringent. It helps to keep
oil in check.
But to you eager Eves whose

there’s a new thrill in skin tonics

To Train Flying Civilians
As soon as all the planes have
been fully assembled, they will be
used by Philippine Army
officers
who are now especializing in the
aviation branch of the service. A
great many of those who will take
up training, however, are civilians
who have been picked out for avia¬
tion service and who are at present
1. e.,
doing "ground schooling,"
theoretical instructions in flying.
These civilians and army officers

will be under the personal instruc¬
tion of Lieutenant William Lee.
Flying lessons will be given them,
and the f ying cadets who finish
the course may or may not be re¬
commended for appointment to the
air corps of the Philippine Army.
More Army Aviators Needed
The Philippine Army just now
is without sufficient aviators to
start the branch with the required
expcrienced personnel. Since the
aviation division of the army has
been created, only two Philippine
Army officers, Lieutenants Vicente
Luna and Marcos Soliman, have re¬
turned from Randolph Field, Te¬
xas, the United States Army flying
school, without finishing their
courses. Lieutenant Jose Francis¬
co is still at Randolch Field finish¬
ing his flying course.
With the arrival of the three
Stearman training planes, it is be¬
lieved that the aviation problem of
the Philippine Army will be defi¬
nitely solved, because instruction to
be given here to the many civilian
cadets will not be as costly as
sending them abroad, as has been
done during the past year.

hinterlands, and finally clear a
piece of the jungle flung away from
civilization. With no roads to con¬
nect them to the outside world, they
are virtuai'y prisoners in the jun¬
gle, suffering privations and di¬
seases of a nature they did not
dream could exist. And yet, they
succeed.
First they cut down the trees in
a section of the land they have se¬
lected. On it they build a little
hut, and plant the rest to leafy
vegetables and fruit trees that
would not take long to bear fruits.
On these growing things and their
fruits they exist when their provi¬


sions have been consumed. Thus
year by year the clearing extends
wider and wider, driving back the
forest foot by foot until at last
they have all the land they want,
cleared and planted. They have
now several hectares of green
things, abacas, coconuts, bananas,
mangoes, vegetables. Although they
are temporarily shut off from the
outside world, they hear there will
soon be government roads built
throughout the place, and they are
happy. They pray the government
would keep its promise.
Discouraged
But few are these brave men.
The rest, upon arriving in the new
piace, lose ail courage and enthu¬
siasm for the quest for which they
had left their birthplaces. A num-
ber of them hire themselves off to
landowners, Japanese preferred,
and are thankful if they are able
to keep body and soul together.
While some choose to stay in the
towns and seek jobs that are no
longer available.
These find the towns of Minda¬
nac—as most growing towns are—
reeking with vice. In their home
towns they had been acquainted with
all forms of vice, as aimost every
poor man perhaps is. There are not
a few of them who owe their present
lot to some form of vice or other.
And suddenly these simple folk
realize that there is a land of pro¬
mise in Mindanao. A promise of
wealth from gambling—a promise
that never comes true.

viction of the murderer.”
The conclusion of the coroner’s
address brought the proceedings to
an end, and as he finished speaking,
the spectators rose and began to
pass out of the Court. I remained
for a minute to speak a few words
to Mr. Holman and ask him to tran¬
scribe his report in duplicate. Then,
I, toc, went out to find my three
companions squeezing into a taxi¬
cab which had drawn up opposite
the entrance, watched with ghoulish
curiosity by a quite considerable
crowd. The presence of that crowd
informed me that the horrible no¬
toriety which I had foreseen had
even now begun to envelop us. The
special editions of the evening pa¬
pers were already out, with, at
east, the opening scenes of the in¬
quest in print. Indeed, during the
short drive to Hilborough Square,
I saw more than one news-vendor
dealing out papers to little knots of
eager purchasers, and once, through
the open window, a stentorian voice
was born in with hideous distinct-
ness, announcing: “Sensational In¬
quest! Funeral stopped!”
I glanced from Wallingford, cow¬
ering in his corner, to Barbara, sit¬
ting stiffly upright with a slight
frown on her pa’e face. As she
caught my eye, she remarked bit-
terlv:
“It seems that we are having
greatness thrust upon us."

MANILA TOURISTS IN INDO.CHINA


FNHE cruising party headed by
Mrs. De Prida head teacher
of the Al fance Francaise, and
which left Manila last April 15th
on the K.M.P. steamer "Tasman,"
arrived in Saigon on the 18th.
The eighteen members of the
party include Mrs. A. Roces, Mrs.
Van Schaicht, Mrs. Shweder, Mrs.
L. Moore; Misses P. Legarda, T.
Legarda. B. Legarda, A. Tuason.
J. Nakpil, D. Heras, M. Crosby, R.
Jones, B. Cunningham, V. Snapp.
Olga Van Sthaicht, D. Hanh, and
L. Roensch.
The first two days after landing
were spent in visiting Saigon. The
party was taken by the staff of
the Government Travel Bureau to
see the Lycee Petrus Ky, a high
school for native boys and girls.
Most of the students in that school
go to their classes on bicycles. The
more than 400 bicycles parked near
the school was a very novel sight
to the visitors.
The head master of the school
gave the necessary explanations
and asked questions to some of the
pupils, who answered in their per¬
fect French. The party was next
taken to the palace of Gover¬

nor Rivoal of Cochinchina, who had
arranged a reception in honor of
the visitors.
In the afternoon, the tourists
visited an art school at Bienhoa,
were later invited to visit the city’s
Sports Club with its beautiful
swimming pool. The splendid Asia¬
tic Art Museum was not omitted
in the itinerary.
The following day, the tourists
went by bus to Phnom-Penh, capi¬
tal of Cambodia, where the Royal
Palace and other magnificent
structures are found. The visitors
saw the palace, the Silver Pagoda,
the Throne Hall, and the Musee
A bert Sarraut.
The ruins of Angkor, situated
in the middle of an immense forest,
were visited next. It took two
and a half days for the visitors to
see all the unique spots in these
ruins.
Later, the tourists enjoyed them¬
selves in the “Baray,” elephant
riding, and seeing Cambodian
dances at night under the glow of
torchlights in front of the Angkor¬
Wat Temple.
Back to Saigon the visitors went;
from there they left by train for
Dalat, the 5,000-foot high resort.

wants to effect these changes as
early as possible. The members of
the budget commission will study
these plan thoroughly and submit
concrete recommendations to the
President on the premises.
School Crisis
Of the numerous problems to
be tackled by the new bureau, I
can pick out the school crisis that
occurs yearly as one of the most
important. With the opening of
the school year but a month away,
the budget office—and the govern¬
ment as a whole—is facing the
yearly question of how to accommo¬
date all children seeking admission
into our schools. This, as every¬
body knows, is caused by lack of
funds with which to open new
classes and to employ additional
schcol teachers. This problem is
among those which the members of
the budget commission will take up
in the immediate future.
Unsustained Activities
Paralyzed for lack of funds,
many government activities are
practically crippled in their opera¬
tions. Other services, although
necessary and imperative, have
been curtailed for the same reason.
Those that were allowed to con¬
tinue have been found functioning
unsatisfactorily for lack of funds
and personnel. We will endeavor
to study the necessity of allowing
these offices to continue operation


by providing sufficient funds for
them. However, if no funds are
available and if we find that these
offices are not functioning proper¬
ly at present for lack of funds and
personnel, we will immediately re¬
commend their abolition. Among
these I can mention some of our
agricultural colonies and experi¬
mental stations.
Elimination of Items
The Constitution contains a
prohibition against the insertion
of any provision in the appropria¬
tions act which does not relate to
any specific provision of that act.
The present act contains many such
unconstitutional provisions. One
of the tasks of the budget commis¬
sion would be to eliminate such
unconstitutional provisions.
Reorganization
The reorganization of all govern¬
ment offices, as a task of the bud¬
get commission specified in the
executive proclamation, is another
important task confronting the
budget commission. I have dis¬
cussed the matter tentatively with
the members of the commission
and with the chairman of the gov-
ernment survey board. The com¬
mission will work hand in hanc
with the government survey boaro
on this matter, as that office has
been studying the matter for
some time now.

FELICIDAD BALLESTEROS
of Himoga-an, Sagay, Occiden¬
tal Negros, who is a municipal
teacher in the district of Sagay,
Occidental Negros, would like to
communicate with her brothers
and sisters in the profession, in
and outside of the Philippines
Her hobbies are doing house¬
work, reading books and maga¬
zines, playing ping-pong, and
going to the movies. She is also
interested in dressmaking and
interior decoration.


ELIGIO N. NOGUERA (8O
Jacoba Street, Lingayen, Panga¬
sinan) who is single and heal¬
thy, seventeen years of age and
a seventh grade graduate of the
Agno (his native town) Elemen¬
tary School, wants to have pen¬
pals in the Philippines and for¬
cign countries. He is five feet
and one inch in height and one
hundred and two pounds in
wcight. His hobbies are going to
the movies, writing letters, pic¬
nicking, swimming, dancing,
reading romantic stories. Corre¬
spondence with him may be had
in Enalish, Ilocano or Pangasi¬
nan. He promises to answer ali
lettors and is ready to swap snap¬


shots with his correspondents.
ALBERTO L. LACSON of
Magalang, Pampanga, desires to
exchange ideas with those who
are crazy about the novelties of
life. He is sixteen years old,
five feet and six inches in height,
and one hundred and twenty-six
pounds in weight. He will be a
third year student in engineer¬
ing at the Mapua Institute of
Technology next June and he is
a member of the Mountain Side
Club of his home town. He pre¬
fers to keep his future pen-pals
wondering about his looks, but
he will send his pictures to the
first ten who will write to him.
His hobbies are going to the mo¬
vies and singing. He prefers to
correspond with girls from fif-
teen years of age up.
VIRGIE FORTALEZA of Va¬
lladelid, Occidental Negros,
would like to have pen-pals
threughout the Istinds. She is
only fifteen years of age and
five feet in height. Her hobbies
are reading romantic novels, rid¬
ing on the bicycle, going to the
movies, and playing ping-pong.
Her favorite movie stars are
Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire,
Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell.
She promises to answer all let¬
ters that she will receive.


big and small, are undergoing dif¬
ficulties in balancing their budget.
Keeping our budget in shape and
mak’ng it balance every year is un¬
doubtedly one of the heaviest tasks
of our chief executive and essen¬
tially also of the budget Commis¬
sion.
Happily enough for us, we have
enjcyed for the past few years the
reputation of keeping a balanced
budget. I remember but one ins¬
tance when the balance of our bud¬
get was threatened, and that was
whon former G.-G. Roosevelt re-
commended a budget whith had an
cuilay of P3,000,000 more than our
income. Since then, nothing has
been dene to threaten the sound¬
ness of our budget system and in
kceping it balanced. Former Gov¬
ernor-General Murphy and our
leaders deserve the credit for that
gcod work. It would be one of the
highest aims of the budget com-
mission to maintain that reputa¬
tion.
One will naturally think that that
the increase in the activities of
the Commonwealth government will
result in the unbalancing in our
budget. The impression is wrong.
One must understand that the ex¬
penses of the government can be
made elastic to conform with our


income. Incidentally, the good co¬
lection for the years 1936 and 1937
augurs financially sound years for
the government.

the most thrilling ever staged in
the province of Batangas this year.

GOLF
The first annual Central Luzon
golf tournament held in Cabana¬
tuan, N.E., the other Saturday and


Sunday was won by the Nueva Eci¬
ja Golf Association, defeating the
Lingayen Beach Golf C'ub, the
Tarlac Golf Club, the Plaridel Golf
Club, and the Del Carmen Filipino
Club. The victory entitled the
NEGA to the first leg of the Tom
Pritchard cup. Ricardo de Soto of
the winning club was awarded the
De Leon’s trophy for making the
lowest individual score for 36 holes:
157.
SWIMMING
Jikirum, Obial, Christiansen,
Francisco, Yldefonso, and Arasad
are the six swimmers reported to
have been recommended to the exe¬
cutive committee of the P.A.A. F.
by the Philippine Swimming Asso¬
ciation for inclusion in the Fili¬
pino team to compete in the Ber¬
lin Olympics. It was learned that
should the P.A.A.F. committee
decide to send only five men, Fran¬
cisco wi'l be omitted; if only four
men, Obial also will be left out.
The Far Eastern record in the
running broad jump was shattered
by U.S.T.’s Nino Ramirez in the
try-outs the other Sunday at the
Rizal Memorial Stadium, when he
leaped to a distance of 25 feet 1
inch. The Far Eastern record
held by C. Nambu of Japan is 24
feet 10-13/16 inches. To be qual¬
ified for the Berlin Olympics, a
P.I. athlete must make 24 feet in
this event.

last year’s national doubles cham¬
pions, successfully defended their
title last May 3rd at the Rizal Me¬
morial Stadium by trouncing Felix
Ampon and San Ang, 6-1, 6-2, 2-6,
6-2. Gavia and Diy entered the fin¬

tory. In the Zionist colony, in Pa¬
lestine, I saw the French creche
and the Anglo-Saxon nursery
school combined. The young child-
ren are taken early in the morning
to a building which was construct-
ed especially for the purpose, and
mothers take turns in taking care
of all the infants and children in
the bui ding so the other mothers
can go either to the field or factory
to work. The objection to this
would be lack of funds. But, if the
state is spending much money for
adults whose habits are already
formed, will it not be wiser to speno
it for those who are in the forma¬
tive stage?
The third problem is the unfair¬
ness of many laws about women in
the civil code. These laws can be
corrected only by legisiation. Men
legis'ators will never pay any at¬
tention to the discriminatory laws
in this code against women, Pecause
their positions in legislatures and
congresses do not depend on women.
The only way then for women to
have these laws abolished and pre¬
vent the enactment of new discri¬
minatory ones is to have the right
of suffrage. This is the main ob¬
ject of the woman suffrage move¬
ment, and not, as narrow-minded
people have pointed out, the ambi¬
tion of women to wrest from men
the positions of whiti they have a
complete monopoly at present.

sciousness of mankind that woman
is a valuable element in govern¬
ment, in peace, and in war. If the
past Great War brought any bene
fit to humankind, it was undoubted-
ly the enfranchisement of women
in many countries. To-day, there
are twenty-eight countries in the
world where women have the right
of suffrage.
The woman of to-day claims that
she is a full-grown human being
and resents to be treated as a mi¬
nor or as a child. She is convinced
that she has reached equality with
man insofar as mental and practi¬
cal achievements are concerned. She
does not wish to duplicate man.
She understands that men and
women have the same origin and
destiny. She believes that the spi¬
rit of comradeship and cooperation
will destroy the old befogging no¬
tions that have drugged the facul¬
ty of reasoning and the intellectual
mechanism of human mind for the
past centuries. She knows that
each creature is endowed by God
with spiritual and material powers.
Her highest ambition is to have

drive out the latter from the world
market. But wherever and when¬
ever there is a demand for the best
cordage materials the choice is in¬
variably in favor of the native
hemp. It is because the Philippine
fibers are never equalled in quality.
Even the sisal fibers, the closest
competitor of the local hemp can¬
not stand comparison with the lat¬
ter in durability and tensile
strength. The reputation enjoyed
by the Philippine hemp in the
world market has not been alienated
yet, despite the challenging threats
of the Javanese and Sumatran fi
bers.
From the standpoint of extensive
investment in the industry, the
number of men engaged in it, and
as a source of government revenue,
the abaca industry ranks as one of
the major industries of the Philip-
pines. But there is one thing, how-
ever, that must not be overlooked.
As is true with the other Philip
ilipino parti¬
pine industries, the
cipation in the hemp industry is
very insignificant.
th the excep¬
tion of furnishing labor: as strip¬
pers, tip cutters or cleaners, classi¬
fiers, small planters, pressing ma¬
chine workers, etc., the Filipinos
have a very meager share in the
abaca industry. The following ta¬
ble shows the distribution of con¬
trol in the foreign exportation of
hemp in Davao:


the opportunity to develop these
beautiful gifts of the Creator. Once
her ambition and demand are ful¬
filled, then we all can say with Kip¬
ling:
So, when all the world is asleep
and there seems no hope of
her waking
Out of the long, bad dream that
makes her mutter and moan,
Suddenly all men arise to the
noise breaking,
And every one smiles at his
neighbor and tells him his
soul is his own.

Fair Wages Given
When the government expressed
its inability to put up a police force
in the mining areas, the company
took over the job and hired eight
special policemen and one chief to
patrol the mining camps, giving
them wages higher than those
given by an ordinary municipality.
The police chief receives ₱100 and
each po'iceman P35 monthly.
The daily wages of the regular
laborer range from P.80 to ₱1.50,
the capataz from ₱1.50 to P4.00.
They work eight hours a day, some¬


It can be seen from the foregoing
table that no business firm dealing
in abaca export trade is Filipino¬
owned; that the Americans lead in
the number of business firms by
owning four out of the total nine
commercial firms; that of the total
(15) pressing or baling machines in
operation in Davao eight are Ja¬
panese-owned. Considering the fact
that a pressing machine averages a
daily output of around 150 bales it
is clear that the Japanese are the
leading exporters of Philippine fi¬
bers in Davao, with the Ameri¬
cans running a close second.
It is true that the abaca indus¬
try has suffered greatly from the
effects of the present universal fi¬
nancial collapse, but very recently
when "war clouds” hung low over
Europe, the local abaca business
showed encouraging signs of activ¬
ity. Business trends indicate that
the Philippine abaca industry is
now on the road to recovery. And
with the apparent failure of the
present London naval conference
which may eventually mean a race
for naval superiority, we may look
forward to the day when Philippine
hemp will duplicate its world war
price.

are compensated for the extra time.
The laborers receive free quarters
in small dwelling houses and in bar¬
racks divided into separate apart¬
ments. Free electric light is fur¬
nished in some houses along the
shore, while a water system affords
safe and easy water facilities. The
laborers a r e charged certain
amounts proportional to their sala¬
ries for hospital funds.
Although much has already been
done for the good of the company
and the laborers, there are plans to
make the mining district more tho¬
roughly progressive in the years to
come. An airport is under construc¬
tion at Larap, and a theatre and a
cemetery will be built sometime
next year. Before the end of the
year a radio station will be put up,
it is also reported.
How many years more will the
company exist?
The general superintendent could
not tell exactly how long, but "if
our annual exportation reaches
500,000 tons, which is quite certain
the iron deposits presently owned
by the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc.
will be exhausted in nine years.
However, we hope to find new de¬

because of the low wages they ac-

said.
“This is not only a case of re¬
patriation,” Mr. Borden added,
“but one of rehabilitation. These
boys have become better citizens,
what with their knowledge of mod¬
ern farming and other jobs in the
U.S. which they can apply to their
farms back home."
According to many of the re¬


patriates interviewed, the main
reason for the reluctance of Fili¬
pinos in taking advantage of the
repatriation law is their sensitive-
ness: they think they would be
looked down upon as failures if
they came home at the expense of
the government. Others were
afraid the government would force
them to settle in Mindanao or join
the army as payment for their
transportation expenses.

HOSPITAL DAY OBSERVED
All hospitals in the Philippines
opened their doors to the public
last Tuesday in commemoration of
the first National Hospital Day un¬
der the Commonwealth. Baby con¬
tests were held; demonstrations in
operations, food preparation, infant
feeding and care of babies were
given. In some of the bigger hos¬
pitals still pictures appropriate for
the day were projected for the edu¬
cation of the visitors. Lectures
were given and hospital specimens
were exhibited. Silver cups were
awarded to the hospitals which ren¬
dered the best participation in the
observance of the day.

have attained."
Dr. Brown, president of Silliman,
introduced the President of the
Commonwealth, lauding His Excel¬
lency’s achievements.
President Brown dwelt at length
on the work achieved by the institu¬
tion. “Silliman University is a
laboratory of racial relations,” he
said. “Here meet as professors
men and women from the best uni¬
versities and colleges of America
and from the best educational
centers of the Philippines. Here,
too, provincial differences are ob¬
literated as students from north and
south, east and west, meet. We are
striving to make your work easier
by sending a stream of men and
women of character into the life of
the Commonwealth. Our graduates
and former students as governors,
assemblymen, leading government
employees, hacenderos, lawyers,
teachers, and ministers have made
your work easier.
“Under the tremendous burdens
you are carrying, your shoulders


will droop unless you are sustained
by the loyalty of our people. Silli¬
man University promises you such
a group of sincere, patriotic help¬
ers."
After President Brown’s speech,
the President was presented with
souvenirs from the university,
consisting of a pencil tray, two
book ends with his initials inlaid,
and a gavel.
All these articles
were made of camagon by the uni¬
versity’s industrial department.
The presentation was made by
Dr. Emilio M. Javier, dean of the
S. U. college of law, in behalf of
President Brown. “The intrinsic
va ue of these articles is, indeed,
negligible,” Dean Javier said, "but
I assure you we are presenting
them to you with the profound re¬
spect and admiration for you of our
Silliman faculty, student body, and
alumni, and with our unqualified
faith and confidence in your wise,
constructive, and fearless leader¬
ship."

yas. President Quezon in¬
Acluded in his itinerary the
Si'liman University which he
visited last May Ist. He was suf¬
fering from inflammation of the
gums but he stood on the plat¬
form of the Silliman auditorium
and conveyed his congratula'ions
on the work done by the univers¬
ity.
“Anyone conversant with the
educational progress of the Philip-
pines,” he said, “cannot fail to
notice the part played by this in¬
stitution of learning in the progress
not only of culture and education
in the Philippines but also of the
development of manhood and char¬
acter among our youth.
“That is why I wish to congra¬
tulate a’l those who have received
all or part of their education in this
institution. This university has
done a lot in the development and
formation of manhood in our coun¬
try. I wish to congratulate this
university on her marvelous record
in the past. I congratulate Dr.
Brown and the whole student body
of this institution on the success
that those who have preceded them

added.*xr
Investigation of the true own-
ership of the Baclaran Hacienda at
Paranaque, Rizal, was asked by
1,000 hacienda tenants of the de¬

that the archbishop who sold the
hacienda to the Monte de Piedad
had no c'ear title to the land, as
shown by documents relating to the
acquisition of the land by the
church.

COMMENTS
RED TAPE Y IVE private citizens, residing in a neighboring
E province, wrote a rush letter to the director of
health and reported the presence of a typhoid epidemic in their com¬
munity. An average of eleven cases and two deaths were being re¬
ported daily, and the disease was fast spreading uncnecked.
Typical of Pnilippine towns, the community has no hospital, no
public cimics of any kind, and its entire population is under the inade¬
quate care of two young physicians who, humanly enough, attended to
the calis of their rich patients. The poor ones were being left unat¬
tendea medically, or were left to the care of quacks.
In the interest of pupiic healtn, vaccinating parties should have
been sent to that community in order to check the spread of the disease.
Notning of the sort was done and, curiousiy enough, the sanitary in¬
spector of the town helplessiy complained that he was short of anti¬
typhoid serum.
Aiter a lapse of over a week, the complaining citizens inquired
as to what was aone about their report. In brief, they were toid ver-
bally: “The communication has been received and will be forwarded by
the airector to the provincial sanitation section for proper action."
The bureau of health has no magic wand and cannot do won¬
ders. But the government can prove its sincerity to the people by be¬
ing prompt in matters where promptness of action is vital.
Yr E have never been able to see just
IN ALL FAIRNESS
WV why it was necessary for the fram-
ers of the Constitution to require a plebiscite among women concerning
woman suffrage. The question is not so much whether or not women
like to vote but whether or not women are entitled to the privilege. No
valid argument has so far been advanced against woman suffrage.
As to the salutary effect of woman suffrage on the political hab-
its of the country, we are not convinced. We do not believe that polit-
ics would be any dirtier, but we do not believe, also, that it will be any
cleaner.

The value of suffrage to women does not lie, we believe, in pos¬
sible direct political advantages to them. We have our doubts as to
their interest in politics as politics. But we understand and sym-
pathize with them in their effort to obtain suffrage which can be a pot-
ent tool for the elevation of the status of women. It is no longer com-
prehensible in these enlightened days why it should still be presumed
that women, who have shown ample evidence that they are not inferior
to men in capacity, ought to be classed with the mentally defective—re-
quiring men’s guidance and protection when there is no proof that such
guidance and protection have always been fair and beneficial to women.
In all fairness, let the women vote if it is their wish to do so. As
women they have their own rights and in all equity they are entitled
to defend and seek full recognition for them. They have been given
the onerous requirement to produce 300,000 affirmative votes from
women to merit suffrage. The requirement is an imposition, but let
it stand. Only the women should be allowed to express their will
freely, without masculine interference and questionable maneuvers to
keep the women from participating in the plebiscite.
EFFICIENCY AT rHERE is a plan afoot to consolidate var¬
I ious offices in the insular government.

the Censtitution in such a way as
to accommodate under-age pres¬
idential candidate Pascual B. Ra¬
cuyal of Cebu.


Wy yE understand Tayabas people
W are very patriotic too: As¬
semblyman Angara of Tayabas is
behind the move to change the
Constitution in order to allow the
President two consecutive terms.
Assemblyman Lavides of Tayabas
is head over heels in love with the
idea too.


N OW that the President has
1( discovered that some of the
Goverrment experiment stations.
are as good as useless and that the
Luneta (Manila) police station has
the filthiest detention cell the
President has ever seen, let us
hope it is discovered in time that
Manila has the filthiest streets in
the civilized world.


From what we read in the
papers we are convinced that
thoroughbreds almost always breed
asses.
