YE said If I Were Dictator was the
subject, and D. H. S. looked at
W
us and we felt he wanted to say,
if he were dictator, he would not be chas¬
ing people all over town just to know
just what they would do if they were dic-
tators. It took two weeks to round up
enough notables to speak on the subject
and we think that it was worth-while.
We are sure you will agree with us after
you have read the article on page 4.
DEGARDING the article on page 9
I about Moros and military training,
we were counseled not to publish it be¬
cause it might give some people the idea
that everybody is free to interpret the
National Defense Act his own way and
act accordingly We published it any¬
way, believing that the earlier everybody
knows that there is only one interpreta¬
tion of the law and that is obedience to
it, the better it would be for the coun¬
try.
FRHE defense of the judiciary, page
110, in spite of the fact that the au¬
thor preferred to be anonymous, should
be reliable: it is fully documented. The
article was written in answer to Judge
Guevara’s criticism of judicial procedure
(  Feb. 13th.) Even if you
should think that the appointment of
Mr. Justice Recto as head of a commit-
tee to revise court rules sustains the cri¬
ticism of Judge Guevara, it will be worth-
while to go over the article to find just
what handicaps prevent the judiciary
from functioning more efficiently.
Incidentally the article on page 16
should lend weight to the contention that
the judiciary as organized at present is
doing all it can to be fully efficient, only
it is not getting the cooperation from
everybody—from the people for instance.
Many cases, it appears, that clog the
dockets should never have been brought
there, minor, silly things most of them.
PruWO things we should like to bring
 to your attention are: Potpourri,
page 21, and Portrait of the Week, new
versions of our The World Outside and
Weekly News Digest, respectively. We
are rather proud of these two new dishes
because... well, we cooked up the stuff
ourself. We are expecting quite an ava¬
lanche of brickbats, but we always believe
in trying anything at least once.
And just to prove it (that we like
to try anything at least once) we are of-
fering Ashes, by Hector T, Alfon, as this
week’s local fiction. As far as we know
so far Mr. Alfon’s only distinction in life
is his being the brother of Estrella D.
Alfon. We remember he said in one of
his letters to the literary editor: “I am
the brother of the Estrella D. Alfon.
Well, he did not get by even with such
recommendation. Then he sent in Ashes.

THE SPOTLIGHT


coming issues
HIS National Council of Education
recently created by His Excell¬
Aency, the President, is to blame
for our getting all excited about the sub¬
ject of education. We have been nursing
in our head all these years the idea that
there is something wrong with this pic-
ture: an ill-kept yard—sagging fence, or
no fence at all, weeds everywhere, stag¬
nant water under the house; broken-down
house—slats missing in places, posts
sagging, roof leaking—and yet students
live in this household, intermediate, high
school or even college students. What
has education to do with this? Plenty
Sound education should instill enough
ambition in the student to make him want
to work for a more decent habitation.
This explains why two distinguished
educators will grace our pages next is¬
sue. You will read two articles, one by
Dr. GILBERT PEREZ
Chief, Division of Vocational Education
Bureau of Education
and the other by
Dr JOHN H. MANNING BUTLER
Division Superintendent of Schools
(Retired)
Another thing. We want this ques¬
tion competently treated if not settled:
Are the young people getting irreligious?
We have been hearing a great deal of the
tendency of the young to be indifferent
to religion. And we wish to announce
that this subject will be treated by two
competent, well-known figures:
Mrs. ROSA SEVILLA DE ALVERO
Directress, Instituto de Mujeres
PROFESSOR SINFOROSO PADILLA
Professor of Psychology,
University of the Philippines
We are very grateful for hints to
improve our usefulness. Here’s one from
Dr. Gilbert Perez:
“Congratulations for the little bio¬
graphies of the artists making your cov-
ers. I would like to have you include the
addresses of the artists in the biography.
That would be of great help to the art-
ists because there are individuals and
schools which would like to purchase oil
paintings and if they knew the addresses
of the artists they could purchase them
directly from the artists—giving the art¬
ists a better price... There are also par¬
ties who would like to purchase the or¬
iginals of the covers."
Three stories, two local and one for¬
eign, will be the offering for next week:
Camias in the Moonlight, by Mrs.
Vicenta A. Lacsamana.
Tender Leaves, by Felixberto Balbas.
Foreign story: Mother Tanner by
John Lineaweaver.
Who Is Who: Celedonio Salvador,
Manila superintendent of schools.
From Baguio:
“Here’s Little Things for the 27th.
Be sure that there is special space be¬
tween the divisions. Last time, there
was even more space between some of
the lines than between the divisions!"
To Baguio: “Yes, sir."

Something Is Bound To Be Accomplished


y ITH the fury with which the President does govern¬
W ing, he is bound to accomplish a number of things.
It is beyond the realm of probability that all of the under¬
takings the President has initiated so far will bear all the results
expected from them. Some will succeed fully, perhaps. Some only
partially. Some may even prove to be failures.
But there is nothing like trying. The one who tries
the most is likely to be the individual who will hit the
mark the most. And this seems to be the philosophy be¬
hind the President’s administration.
So far the following have been created:
The National Defense Council,
The National Economic Council,
The Government Reorganization Survey Board,


The National Council of Education, and
The Rice Commission.
On the other hand, it should not be considered far¬
fetched to mention at this time that the solution of eco¬
nomic, educational, defense, and other national problems
are far from being done with the creation of committees
and councils. Unfortunately, it has been the custom in
the past to consider a problem properly attended to with
the appointment of a number of men to a committee. In
the past, committees served more to humor the people, sel¬
dom to thresh out thoroughly problems presented to them
for solution.
It is not being predicted here that the various bodies
created by the President will not accomplish anything.
But they will produce results only when they steer clear
off the practices of the past.

GOODBYE, SWEEPSTAKES
JUNE SWEEPSTAKES WILL BE LAST, PRESIDENT
QUEZON DECLARES


g ORE government and less
GEN
politics," said President
M quezon immediatey af¬
ter he assumed office, thinking
very likely he would astound the
nation with the statement.
Many people used to Mr. Que¬
zon’s genius for making slogans
smiled and said, "If that is not like
the President!” And these people
cannot be blamed entirely for smil¬
ing knowingly and exhibiting skep¬
ticism. How many such pro¬
nouncements have come from on
high? And what have been the re-
sults?
But hardly four months after the
President has been inducted into
office, many of the skeptics are
already rubbing their eyes, scarce¬
ly able to believe that Mr. Quezon
apparently meant what he said
when he announced that there would
be "more government and less pol¬
itics.” The government business is
obviously moving at a more rapid


President Quezon: will stop sweepstahes.


gait, decisions are acted upon
without delay, and above all, poli¬
tics seems to be very little consid¬
ered.
Last week, for instance, the
President astounded the country
when he announced to assembled
provincial governors and treasurers
that after the June sweepstakes,
this government-conducted gam-
bling institution will cease to exist.
Since its establishment a dumping
ground for political lame-ducks and
highly-connected proteges of politi¬
cians, it is quite a surprise to hear
the President has decided to kill
the organization which has accom-
modated many powerful political
friends.
The President apparently real¬
ized that as long as the government
is conducting the sweepstakes, it is
hypocritical to hunt down jueteng
maintainers and bettors and others
engaged in prohibited games. As
an example to the people, he said,


there will be no sweepstakes after
June.
June is quite a long way off yet,
and anything may happen between
now and June, but in view of the
strong statement of the President
concerning the abolition of the
sweepstakes, and the new policy
being followed by His Excellency
in the running of the government,
there seems little likelihood that
the sweepstakes will live a day aft-
er the next drawings.
After all the sweepstakes, in
spite of all claims advanced to jus¬
tify its creation and existence, has
not lived up to expectations. Social
undertakings of great importance
have received less help than the


others not so important. To take
one case. The ravages caused by
tuberculosis in this country is so
great this disease easily tops all
other diseases in destructiveness.
And yet the Antituberculosis So¬
ciety has not received, in propor¬
tion to the importance of the work
that it is undertaking, its proper
share of the proceeds of the
sweepstakes. We have a magnifi¬
cent athletic field, composed of a
number of imposing stadia, neces¬
sary in a way and under certain
circumstances, but we have a lone,
small tuberculosis sanatorium in¬
capable of accommodating even a
small fraction of tuberculars need¬

IF I WERE DICTATOR


If you were given the opportunity to run the government and granted dictatorial
powers, you would, naturally, proceed to attend first to the enforcement of such reforms
you deem most imperative. And if it were possible to ask every individual in this country
to state what he would do if he were dictator, the result would be the most accurate pic¬
ture of what the inhabitants of this country want their government to do: what pro¬
blems to solve and how to solve them.
It is impossible, however, to contact every individual of the country for the purpose
of finding just what everybody's opinion is with respect to national problems. But a
fairly accurate cross-section of national opinion may be obtained. This is attempted in
this symposium.


By Dean JOSE A. ESPIRITU
College of Law, U.P.
Y FI can have my way, I will
immediately do s o m e thing
Aabout the colonization of
Mindanao, Sulu, Palawan, and
other less developed sections of
the Archipelago.
To my mind, the government
should exert more effort in the
development of our undeveloped
lands through a more energetic co¬
lonization program. The govern-
ment should initiate a practical
colonization program to counteract
an activity such as is being con¬
ducted by the Japanese in Davao.
We must understand that we should
undertake such a step now or oth-
ers will do it for us and we shall
be forever sorry for having been
so negligent.
If I can also have my way, I
will do something for the proper
conservation of our mineral re¬
sources. The exploitation of these
resources should be legally and pro¬
perly supervised by the govern¬
ment so that our own countrymen
may derive the benefits. Further-
more, I shall do something for the
gradual industrialization of the
country. It is my belief that we
should develop our power resources.
This is not only necessary for our
material progress but also for our


Dean Jose A. Espiritu: will de some¬
thing about the cosomization of Mindanao
and other undeveloped sections of the
Archipelago


national defense. We have numer¬
ous rivers and streams which can
furnish cheap electric power. The
government should develop these, or


Registrar Melquiades Gamboa: would
nationalize all important industries and
place their operation under the civil
serulca.


it should allow, under government
supervision, private individuals
and corporations to undertake the
task.


Dr. Angel Trinidad: will advacate re¬
forms that will make the government
place emphasis on the control of the
sprend ot tuberculosis.


By Prof. Melquiades Gamboa
Registrar, University of the Philippines
Y FI had my own way, I would
nationalize all the important
A industries but would place
their operation under the civil
service. Then I would raise on a
graduated scale ranging from 5%
to 50% the tax on all incomes
above P3,000.
Finally, I would provide every
family of the disgruntled tenant
class with a small piece of land
which they could till and call their
own.

will recommend that the gov-
ernment reclaim or get a reim¬
A bursement of large sums of
money illegally acquired by cor¬
rupt officials.
It is no secret that there are ma¬
ny in this country who have en¬
riched themselves while occupying
public offices. Many of them are
now out of the government but
others are still there. In either
case, I will recommend that part
of the wealth of these opulent offi¬
cials and former officials be con¬
fiscated by the government.
This drastic measure was ef¬
fected in Spain a few years ago and
there is no doubt that we can do it
in the Philippines with success. In

If I can have my own way, I will
not hesitate to carry out such a
drastic plan.
By Dr. NICANOR REYES
President, Far Eastern University
W FI can have my own way, I
will immediately remove a
I yery serious handicap to the
growth of Filipino-owned schools.
Under existing laws and as pro¬
vided in the Constitution, institu¬
tions of learning operated by reli¬
gious orders and organizations are
exempt from taxation. This ex-
emption is a very serious handicap
to the growth and even the existence
of Filipino-owned schools.
Many of our private educational
institutions are being run by reli¬
gious organizations. These insti¬
tutions have three distinct advan¬
tages over the Filipino-owned pri¬
vate schools: First, these schools
are exempt from real estate taxa¬
tion. Second, they pay no income
taxes as corporations. Third, the
directors, presidents, rectors or
deans of these institutions likewise
do not pay any income tax.
In other countries, laws are en¬
acted to benefit their own respec-
tive nationals. In contrast with
such a practice, we have enacted
laws primarily for the benefit of
aliens.
Those operating non-sectarian
private schools in the Philippines
are not asking for special privi¬
leges. All that they pray for are
opportunities and privileges equal
to those enjoyed by entities with
whom they are in competition. It
would be just and equitable, they
believe, that sectarian schools—the
majority of which are owned by
foreigners—should be freed from
the payment of taxes if these insti¬
tutions are giving free education,
that is, if they do not charge fees.
But this is not the case. They
charge fees as high as, if not high¬
er than, the fees charged in many
Filipino private schools.


By GREGORIO ANONAS
Manager, Metropolitan Water District
FI can have my own way, I
will immediate'y introduce
A here some radical educational
reforms. The Commonwealth has


its own defined objectives and it
seems to me that these objectives
can be attained through the aid of
our schools.
If economic development and
national defense are the two out¬


standing objectives of our govern¬
ment, then our schools should start
implanting these objectives in the
minds of our young boys and girls.
The citizens of tomorrow should be
prepared to shoulder their respon¬

PENALIZING the DESERVING
ONE-GRADE PROMOTION RULING UNJUST TO WORTHY
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES


By ISIDRO L. RETIZOS
Member,   Editorial Staf!


y yHEN the Murphy cabinet
passed, on August 7, 1933,
Wa resclution pronibiing sa¬
lary promotions of more than one
grade each year, the cabinet mem¬


bers did not dream that they would,
some day, be flagrantly unfair to
deserving government emp oyees.
They never imagined then that
their order, still in strict force to¬
day, would serve as a hindrance to
the promotion of worthy public
servants and, at the same time, of-
fer an easy stepping stone for in¬
experienced newcomers.
Briefly, the resolution required
that any change of position, de¬
signation, or promotion of any gov¬
ernment official or employee must,
in any case, carry only a salary
increase of just one grade. A
grade, according to this rule, is
equivalent to ₱10 for minor em¬
ployees although it amounts to as
much as P50 for higher officials.
Only A ₱10-Raise
The order, on its face value,
seemed liberal to the public serv¬


ants. A PlO-raise, or any raise, as
Director Jose Gil puts it, is some-
thing any government employee
should be thankful for these days.
But, as conditions stand, there
may be a vacancy in a government
department, bureau or office. The
vacancy may carry a substantial
salary. A low-salaried employee,
eligible to the post, may be pro¬
moted to fill it. But he cannot get
the full salary attached to the job;
he will only be given a salary in¬
crease corresponding to one grade.
Now, here is the unfairness. An
inexperienced outsider, so long as
he has qualified himself according
to civil service regulations, can be
appointed and given the full salary.
To exemplify, take the case of
Mr. Rafael Amparo of the Supreme
Court office. His salary was P3,-
400. When the Court of Appeals
started functioning, the Supreme
Court recommended him to be the
appellate tribunal’s clerk of court
with a salary of P4,000 per annum.
He was so appointed, but the civil
service cut the salary recommenda¬
tion to P3,800, reasoning that to
give him P4,000 would mean a pro¬
motion of more than one grade.
That was what Director Gil said,
and added that Mr. Amparo will
perhaps get another raise next year
to obtain the full salary.
A P55-Hospital Physician
A pitiful victim of this one-grade
promotion is a junior resident phy¬
sician in a southern provincial hos¬
pital. He first entered the govern-
ment service as a medical assistant
at the San Lazaro hospital with a
salary of P45.00 monthly. Later, he
took the civil service examination
for junior resident physician, and
passed it. He was appointed and
sent south.
Director Jacobo Fajardo, with
the approval of his department sec-
retary, recommended an entrance
salary of ₱100 for the doctor. The
civil service bureau, following the
cabinet order, turned the recom¬
mendation down. So, right now, all
the junior medico is getting is P55
monthly, for a job that carries an
appropriation of P1.800 per annum.
What is more humiliating, some of
the hospital clerks there receive a
bigger pay than the doctor.
The doctor, of course, can resign
from his post and reapply soon
afterwards. But, according to the
civil service bureau, that procedure
would be circumventing the law.


Director Gil of the civil service bu¬
remu: adheres strictly to civil service
rule on promotions.


Thus, should he do it, his applica¬
tion—in spite of his experience—
would surely be rejected. Worse, an
outside doctor, also eligible (many
of them are in the waiting list),
will be appointed instead. And he
will get P1,800 per annum!
Many Without Promotions
Yet, barring these actual facts,
one might say government emplo¬
yees are favored. They get automa¬
tic one-grade promotion, meaning a
PlO-increase, every year. But that
is not true. They do not get pro¬
motions for years at a stretch. A
huge army of employees stay on in
the service, and they receive raises
very rarely. Many, aged in years,
and embittered, have left the gov-
ernment service, their last salary
the same in amount as the first one
they had received.
In a bureau, there is an attorney
—considered the most efficient. To
him is entrusted the most delicate
legal cases. He started, ten years
ago, at ₱100 a month. To-day, he
gets only P120. Yet others of his
rank, less efficient, who have
stayed only for a few years, get
higher salaries. Why?
₱1,700-Responsibility for ₱70
Bitterly unfair, if not insulting,
is this one-grade promotion for de¬
serving employees. In a department
a P60 technical man, doing public¬
ations work, saw an opening to pro¬
mote himself. It was an editorial
vacancy in the division of public-
ations, salary P1,700 a year. He
took the examination, passed it,
and was recommended for the job.
Once more, the civil service stepped
in. “You are a government em¬
ployee,” it said. "So you get the job
at P70 not at P1,700 a year.” The
fellow refused; it was too much res¬


the

PSYCHIC
DEPRESSIONS
are nowadays not a rare
thing with men and women!
Diminished physical capability, more
especially in consequence of the germ¬
glands, cause mental disinclination ens¬
trangement between the sexes, and
decrease in the joy of life.

therapy, the remedy has been found, which brings about a regeneration
of the whole organism and thus restores the enjoyment of life.

P36-Clerk Lawyers
The same thing is happening in
the other bureaus. Bright fellows,
eligible and capable, are not given
the boost to which, in justice, they
are entitled. A host of typist clerks
do dirty government work at P36.00
a month.
Now, many of these were self-


supporting young men who studied
law at night, and passed the bar
later. Naturally, they don’t want
to be just P36-clerks anymore. They
wanted to be bureau law clerks, the
entrance salary being ₱100. They
took the law clerk examination and
passed it. But they were told: “To
be appointed to existing vacancies,
you must be content to receive P46."

PrHE boxing fans who packed
the Balasan (Iloilo) stadium
in the night of last February
15th were prepared to see blood
from the combatants. But they
never knew that blood would
spurt from one of them, did not


know that swift death would fol¬
low.
At about half past eight that
night, 23-year-old Concordia Susbi¬
lla entered the stadium and saw

heart, 18-year-old Carlos Buenaflor
whom she used to call Carling.
Insults Her In Stadium
The young man approached her
and rudely demanded why she was
there and what she wanted. He
also pushed her with a cane he car¬
ried. The girl did not flare up and
make a scene in the stadium be¬
cause she had become accustomed
to such insults from her former
lover even in the presence of other
people.
Carlos Buenaflor, through with


Concordia Susbilla, the killer, phato¬
graphed with her guards.


insulting the girl, seated himself
beside a Miss Silva Lacson and her
cousin. Not far from them Con¬
cordia took a seat,
The young man caught Concor-
dia looking at him in the midst of
a bout. He saw her looking at him
again after that and several times
he demanded why she was staring
at him that way, each time his an¬
ger rising, but he got no answer
from her.
A short while after that there
was a recess for the main bout.
The two girls who were seated be¬
side Carlos went out to buy some¬
thing, leaving the young man seat¬
ed by the ringside.
A Knife Flashes
Then without warning a blade
flashed. People turned their eyes
toward the commotion and they saw
Concordia standing beside Carlos,
her two hands gripping the hilt of
a sevillana knife buried to the hilt
in the young man’s back.
Just as the girl pulled the fatal
knife, a boy snatched it from her
before she could make a second


thrust. But the first was enough.
Ten minutes later the young man
died.
It was learned later that Concor¬
dia left the stadium unnoticed aft-
er she had received the insulting
remarks from Carlos; she went to
a carenderia in the market which is
near the stadium and borrowed the
knife, which she wrapped in a
piece of paper. This paper-wrapped
weapon she further camouflaged
with a fan.
The victim was able to say only
“I have been stabbed," and he died
on the bench on which he sat,
bathed in his own blood. When the
police officers arrived, they found
Concordia ready and willing to go
with them.
A Woman Scorned
The plot of the story which cul¬
minated in the stabbing is as old
as the world itself. “I met Carling
at the school where we studied to¬
gether,” this girl, who is a native
of Dalid, Santa Barbara, Iloilo, told
the writer when the latter visited
her in prison. “I met Carling in
the school which we both attended.
That was when I was a third year
student in Home Economics. We
boarded in the same house and nat¬
urally we were often with each oth-
er. I helped him financially as I
used to receive rather good monthly
allowances then."
When she went home for vaca¬
tion at the end of the school term,
her parents became alarmed at the
secret they discovered. In July,
1929, she gave birth to a child in
her home town, Dalid. In August
the child died.
“From then on," she said, "my

on the 7th of the same month. All
able-bodied Filipinos, from 20 to
50 years, may be called to the col¬
ors to train for a period of 5-)z
months. Whether they be Ilocanos
from the north or stalwart Moros
from the south, does not matter.
Every man, with few exceptions,
must learn to hand e arms.

fense plan, that most Filipinos will
gladly train that they may be pre¬
pared to bear arms for their coun¬
try in time of need. But how about
the Moros? How do they feel
about the training the national de-
fense plan calls for?
Against Tactical Training
Here in Lanao, during one of my
trips from Kolambugan, I asked
Moro passengers of the bus I was


Pictures above shaw some Christian
(top) and Moro soldiers of the Paitip-
pine army. The presence of Maras in
the Philippine army is an apparent
contradiction to the cantention that they
hate military training.


in their opinion of the National De¬
fense Act. They were quite out¬
spoken. "No military training! We
don’t want it. If the government
forces us to drill, we will refuse to
do so and fight instead."
In Dansalan, the usual quiet at¬
mosphere was suddenly ruffled
when I broached the topic among
Maranaos id'ing in a photographer’s
shop. Gathering the import of my
statements, they impatiently quit
their benches and became heatedly
voluble. It was plain enough, what
hey said: “We don’t want compul¬
ry training. Compel us, and we
 ht.


Datu Will Go to Hills
I was not satisfied with the ad¬
verse opinion of the middle-class
Maranaos. I decided to see a pro¬
minent datu of the province. He is
a'so, at present, a government of¬
ficial—a fat man with a big stom¬
ach.
"Datu,” I asked, noting his
stomach, "what will you feel when
army officers command you to
double-time?”


He eyed me seriously, "Well, I’m
against military training—for Mo¬
ros, at least. If they force me to
drill, Pil ask for my guns, run to
the mountains, gather my followers,
and...
But the datu thought it best to
leave his answer dangling for a
suitable end. He, at least, left me
undecided, unsure of what he wou'd
do next after gathering his follow¬
ers.

By AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER
(Note: All the figures were taken from
Reports on file in the Dept, of Justice)


The article Our Anachronistie and
Inefficient Judicial System by Judge
Guillermo B. Guevara published in the
February 13th issue of   has
received a great deal of comment.
Most of the commentators agreed with
Judge Guevara and praised him for
bringing to public attention the pre¬
sent state of the judiciary. However,
there have been a few who disagreed
with the author of the said article.
One of thein is the author of the fol¬
lowing article. It is regrettable that
the author should prefer to remain
unknown, but we give assurance that
the author is in a good position to
speak on his subject.


Judge Guillermo Guevara: he wrote
“Our Anachronistic and Inefficient Judi¬
cial System,” which is being answered
in the following article.


FnHE administration of justice
cannot be judged by a cer¬
tain isolated case or cases.
That would be most misleading.
The structure should be taken as a
whole. On this unassailable pre¬
mise, statistical records are the
best answer to any criticism of in¬
efficiency leveled against the judi¬
ciary and the administration of
justice. It is not true, for exam¬
ple, that there are numerous cases
more than 5 and 10 years old in
the dockets of the various courts.
It is only in probate, testamentary,
intestate, and guardianship pro¬
ceedings that such long-standing
cases may be found. It is because
of the inherent nature of these
preceedings, with which every
lawyer is acquainted.
State of the Dockets
With respect to criminal and or¬
dinary civil cases, the number of
long-standing cases is almost nil.
The figures as of November 14,
1935, for the entire Philippine Is¬
lands, are as follows:
Criminal cases with and without
prisoners:
More than 2 years old .... 22
More than 3 years old .... 23
More than 5 years old ... 4
More than 10 years old
Ordinary civil cases:
More than 2 years old
.241


More than 3 years old ....164
More than 5 years old .... 62
5
More than 10 years old
(Note: In three of the four criminal cases
more than 5 years old, the accused
cannot ba found and their bonds
have been confiscated.)
If the foregoing figures are di¬
vided by the number of provinces
any reasonab'e man wou'd admit
that this state of the dockets thru¬
out the country is most satisfactory.
It is to be noted that the number of
pending criminal cases is much less
than that of civil cases. This is be¬
cause judges can exercise more ef¬
fective control over these cases.
The Department of Justice keeps
a close supervision of the progress
in the disposition of cases. The re¬
ports of the various judges are re¬
ceived in the Department periodic-
ally. These reports are compiled
carefully, and if any sluggishness is
noted, the judges concerned are
urged to exert efforts to expedite
the disposal of their cases. They are
a'so asked to exp’ain the delay in
the trial and disposal of a case.
Reasons for Delay.
These explanations are at once in¬
structive and interesting. They re¬
veal that in many instances the de¬
lay in the dispatch of cases is at¬
tributable primarily to the lawyers
and parties themselves. From a
southern province, for example, the
following was the explanation re¬


FORMULA: 0.5 Gm. Aspirin and 0.05 Gm. Caffein per tabler


ceived:
“The province of ...........
has 126 practicing attorneys and
naturally due to their activities
the number of cases increases
very inuch in comparison with the
cases of the previous years, and it
is supposed that the tactic follow¬
ed by some lawyers in order to
collect their fees before the ter¬
mination of their respective cases,
is to ask always in Court for
postponement of the hearing, alleg¬
ing that the 'testigo principal' has
not as yet arrived. This fact has
not been rebutted when Hon.
Judge . . . . . . . . .. made reference
to it in his long speech delivered
in . . . . . . . . . . Hotel when a ban¬
quet was given in his honor by
the “Colegio de Abogados," then
headed by the Dean, the Hon.
. . . . . . . . . On the contrary as
a sign of confirmation, the lawyers
who were present at the said ban¬
quet laughed joyfully on hearing
the heavy joke.”
Other explanations received are
equally plausible. In one province,
the court could not hold session
during the entire period provided
by law because of lack of transport¬
ation facilities. In another, the
civil cases of long standing are
e'ther bankruptey cases or cases
that involve extended accounting.
There are many cases where attor¬
neys have not filed their memo¬
randa for years, and the opposing
parties do not seem to care. In
some cases the witnesses lived very
far away from the capital of the
province and the hearing had to be
postponed repeatedly, because they
could not be located, or were unable
to attend. In one case an accused
could not be tried because he had
to be sent to the Insu’ar Psychopa¬
thic Hospital for treatment. In
other cases, minor delinquents are
involved who, after due hearing,
were committed to Welfareville or
to the custody of a probation of¬
ficer. In still other cases, the ac¬
cused could not be arrested. Very
few are the cases pending decision
by the Judges.
Individual Records of the Judges
Coming now to the individual
records of the Judges of First In¬
stance in the disposal of cases, the
figures are still more satisfactory,
as the reader may judge from the
following tabulated statement:

Cadastral cases are not included

to be included, the daily average
of cases decided would be higher
yet. But it is evident from the fig-
ures shown that our judges have
been exerting commendab'e efforts
to dispose of as many cases daily
as possible. More cannot be ex¬
pected of them without breaking


them or without jeopardizing the
interests of justice.
No Judicial Machinery Is Perfect
No judicial machinery can be
perfect. There is not a system of
administration of justice anywhere
in the world that may not be im¬
proved. There are always numerous
delays, flaws here and flaws there.
The ideal state is a long ways yet
from being attained.
That is why all constructive sug¬
gestions for improvement of the
judicial structure should be wel¬
comed instead of discouraged.
From what precedes, however,
and from an unbiased survey of
the situation, it may safely be
c'aimed that the administration of
justice in the Islands can stand
comparison with any other system
abroad. Our judiciary is com¬
paratively efficient, the delays in
the disposal of cases are no worse
than in other jurisdictions, actual
corrupt'on is absent.
Our system of procedure is sim¬
pler than in most other jurisdictions
with the possible exception of that
of England. The Code of Criminal
Procedure is modern and so is the
system of code pleading embodied
in the Code of Civil Procedure. The

LETTERS TO TWO FILM STARS
MR. MORANTTE GOES OVER PHILIPPINE LETTERS TO
GINGER ROGERS AND ANNE SHIRLEY
By P. C. MORANTTE


T was exceedingly generous and kind of
Ginger Rogers and Anne Shirley, two young
 and beautiful stars of R-K-O studios, to
grant me the privilege of looking into their
numerous letters from the Philippines. It was,
however, with the best intention in mind and
with a goodly measure of respect for the or¬
iginal writers’ confidential thoughts that 1
approached these letters. Notwithstanding. I
have taken the liberty of isolating a few of
them and offering them in print for public
perusal for the express purpose of clarifying
dubious facts and illuminating admirers of
movie stars on pertinent points and sundries.
The following letter to Anne Shirley by Aida
E. of Herran, Santa Ana, Manila, serves to
illustrate a case in particular:
“Miss Anne Shirley.—I am writing you
this letter from an unknown fan begging some
of your pictures. My hubby is reading books
and collecting pictures of actors and actres¬
ses... etcetera. Truly yours, A.E.”
Now, this letter—aside from being gen¬
uinely childish, which is, in this instance, easily
pardonable, considering that the writer is only
a seventh grade pupil and very young—appears
positively harmless. In fact, to the casual read-
er, there is nothing in it at all that would up-
set whatever honest wishes the letter entails.
But from the viewpoint of the noted recipient.
who receives hundreds and hundreds of letters
daily with about 99C% expressing the same cli¬
che wish, naturally the hackneyed phrase “col¬
lecting pictures” has a decidedly odious ring to
it. Immature or young letter writers, however,
are masters of unconscious humor, and in the
case of Aida whom I mentioned above, the two
sentences are so innocently facetious that Anne

Ginger Rogers: receives from the Philippines numer¬
aus fan letters samples of which are included in the
accompanying article.


Shirley could not help but be tickled to the ex¬
tent of giving her a picture.
And now here’s a personal to Aida: The
word “hubby” is not in the dictionary, but it
is a good colloquialism meaning
“husband."
And movie stars fondly use hubby instead of
darling when referring to their legal spouse.
When writing to movie stars, requesting any
favor, it is undeniably a good policy to write
with utmost care and sincerity. In Ginger Ro¬
gers' mail from the Philippines, I found very
many of the letters were written slovenly, in¬
sincerely, and thoughtlessly. I am not referring
to the English syntax used by the writers, for
virtually English is an alien tongue to the Fi¬
lipinos, so that it would be unfair for Ameri¬
cans to expect flawless correspondence from the
natives. It is, nevertheless, flattering to hear
from many of the stars expressing their aston-
ishment at a great number of fairly well-writ¬
ten English letters they receive from the Phil¬
ippines. In the studios I have visited I have
frequently b e e n
asked if English is
a medium of ex¬
pression used ex¬
tensively by the na¬
tives, to which I
never hesitate to re¬
ply in the negative;
es
you see, my answer
e 
heightens their sur¬
Ssag
prise, and unless
ong
I’m further inter¬

NE
rogated, of course I
never take the trou¬
ble to lessen the
effect by an admis¬
sion that English is
and has always


been taught in our schools since the American
occupation.
But what 1 started out to say about care¬
lessly written letters to movie stars is this:
some of Ginger Rogers’ correspondents just
tore a page from their composition notebook
and scrawled an illegible request for her photos.
I suspect that the writers are either high
school students or elementary pupils who are
too lazy to wash their face before they go to
school. Of course, Miss Rogers (or Mrs. Lew
Ayres) paid little attention to them, if at all.
One M. R. of Iloilo city tore out a page
from his memorandum book, wrote on both
sides and, after confessing his admiration to
the star, said in conclusion: "Now, Ginger, give
me a picture. Thanking you in advance. Af-
fectionately.”
Personal to M. R.: Don’t blame Miss Rogers
if you don’t receive any of her photos. Please
know that a picture sent out by stars costs from
fifteen cents to thirty-five cents, and if you
don’t ask for it in a gentlemanly manner, how
can you expect her to spend a nickel on you?
Personal to Alex A. of "Davao Mind”: 1
am glad to inform you that Miss Rogers read
your letter with delight. Of course we under¬
stand you have a mind and you didn’t mean to
show off, either, when you wrote this passage:
“Miss Rogers how did you learned those grace¬
ful and malaverous (italics mine) dancing and
singing of yours? I hope I may be able to
learned and passes those steps and vaile...” I
should like to quote some more lines, but I sup¬
pose this is enough. Anyway, we tried to lo¬
cate that place “Davao Mind,” but we simply
couldn’t find it on the map. Maybe you mean
“Mine.” At any rate, next time you write, be
careful with your own address.
Personal to Miss Agustina V. of Cebu, Cebu:
When asking for a picture, do not tell any of
the Hollywood stars you have an album of
screen actresses. Stars are human beings and
they have a certain amount of pride in glorying
to be "singular” in their profession, even in the
humble confines of your home. The mere men¬
tion that her own picture (that is, of the star
to whom you wrote) would be just one of your

collections is enough to spoil your honest wish.
And what’s more, don’t send the same wording
or carbon copies of the body of your letter to
any movie star you know. Inject into your let¬
ter something novel and personal, that is, in
every one you send out. Give the stars some¬
thing bright, something to tickle them or make
them laugh. Heaven knows they all have their
drab and dreary moments in spite of the tinsel
and bubble and laughter surrounding their gla¬
morous life.
Personal to A. C.O. of Manila Electric Co.:
Please, Mr. O, don’t be too familiar with stars.
Don’t say, “But remember, Ginger, this one
traveled ten thousand miles to reach you in or¬
der to voice the humble opinions of a Filipino
admirer...” And then follow it with a confes¬
sion of your weakness. Women are women and
they like he-man stuff in their admirers. I am
surprised that you should allow the Manila
electric to shock Ginger.
Personal to Ben C. C. & FabicG. of Magda¬
lena, Manila: We liked your mentioning the
Philippines in your letter and pointing it out
as "Pearl of the Orient Seas.” Some of the
people here identify countries of the Orient
with filth. Miss Rogers is also very apprecia¬
tive of your “desire to install your (meaning
Miss Rogers’) talents into the heart of my
friends.” But for heaven’s sake, make it plain
to her that even though you and your friend
live at the same address, you did not mean that
also the cat or dog around you should each
have a picture.
Personal to N. S. of Lingayen, Pangasinan:
Miss Anne Shirley had already sent you one
of her pictures. What’s the idea of requesting
another? You didn’t give any reason. In a


Anne Shirley dedicutes the above photo ta her many
adrirers in the Philippines from whom she receives in¬
teresting letters.


case like this, what you have to do is to buy
an international coupon from the Post Office
in the amount of twenty-five cents and send the
same to Miss Anne Shirley, c/o R-K-O Studios,
Hollywood, California.
Personal to Aurelia B. and V. B. of Cebu,
Cebu: You want what? Complete information
on Ginger Rogers’ life in “her profession"?
Have pity, Miss B. and Mr. B. It’s a big order
for Miss Rogers. One of these days she will
write her autobiography and when it is pub-
lished, buy it. If I had more space here, I would


give you the information you want. However.
if you’ll send me a letter c/o  , with
self-addressed envelope, I think I can accom-
modate you.
Personal and warning to H. C. F. of Zam¬
boanga, Mindanao: Be careful with what you
say. The next time you write a foolish letter,
I’m afraid you'll get into a jam. I can’t print
a word of what you said to Miss Shirley.
Personal to E. E. of Calbayog, Samar:
Here’s the information you want: Miss Anne
Shirley is five feet two inches tall; born in New
York City, April 17, 1918; partly titian-haired;
her eyes are brown; her hobby is reading books
and magazines; she appeared in these pictures
—Mother Knows Best, Private Lessons, The
Key, Anne of Green Gables, School for Girls,
Chasing Yesterday, and others I don’t recall
just now.
Personal to Lieutenant A. S. of Baguio:
Miss Ginger Rogers did not come from Galves¬
ton, Texas. She hails from Independence, Mis¬
souri. She would be 25 years old next July
16th.
Personal to B. T. of Tondo, Manila: Your
request is under consideration by Miss Ginger
Rogers.
An aside to H. C. of Manila: For Pete's
sake, don’t send me a letter again in care of
the studio. It was a good thing the person who
came upon your letter knows me. Please know,
sir, that I am not in any way, manner or form
connected with any of the Hollywood movie stu¬
dios, nor do I have a shade of personal relations
with the stars you mentioned.

Gold-Plated
 rosberity
By PEDRO A. VENIDA


FNVICKLE Paracale earth with a
pick and it grins with yellow
A teeth. This, coupled with the
zooming down of abaca and copra
prices, has started a new gold
rush to the mining town.
Three years ago, Paracale was a
dormant community of storm-beat¬
en houses, its streets green with un¬
kempt grass. Now it is a veritable
beehive.
American prospectors revived all
this fresh interest. With pick and
pan, they ascended mountains, grop¬
ed through old tunnels, descended
pits—and returned with bags full of
samples of rocks imprisoning yel¬


low nuggets of the precious metal.
Then old mining claims were re¬
newed, new ones staked out. Com¬
panies, corporations and associa¬
tions were formed with amazing
speed.
The most important mining con¬
cern formed during this new gold
rush in the town is the Paracale
Mining Company. It has gone as
far as constructing an airplane
landing field, a hospital, and a
hardware store. The Marsman and
Company which manages this con-
cern also controls the Coco Grove
Placer Syndicate which has started
operations with its two dredging
machines. The Northern Mining


Not many years ago a quiet tawn with storm-beaten houses, Paracale has
alreedy grown into a rich, busy community because of the discovery of more gald.
Top photo: dredging the Paracale river. Lower photo: offices, power house, and
tunnels of the United Paracale Mining Co., one of the big mine companies of
Paracale.


Development Company, the North
Camarines Mining Company, the
Paracale Gold Mining Company, and
the Paracale Gumaos are also dig¬
ging for gold in the old mining
town.
In what had once been vacant
lots now stand many houses. Lots
in business sectors which had serv-¬
ed for gardens or grounds for pigs
cannot now be had for love or mo¬
ney. A new theatre now occupies
what had previously been a vacant
lot. And just across the street, a
three-story building—the first of
its kind in the whole province—is
about to be finished. The town has
now a presidencia and a market
place. Bowling alleys and boxing
arenas have cropped up. With these
have come cabarets and women of
cheap virtue. Liquor flows freely
in the town.
And not only those who hope to
be employed by mining companies
rush to Paracale. Independent gold
diggers have found that the process
of placer mining called labadero is
practical despite its crudeness.
Soil is simply dug to a depth of
about 1 meter and is transported to
a stream. Here the flowing waten
carries away the soil and the clay
matter, leaving the heavy materials
—including gold dust and nuggets
—in a graduated sluice. When the
rocks and pebbles have been remov-


ed, the yellow dust and nuggets are
transferred to a wooden vessel for
panning. A thirsty stranger in the
barrios cannot hope to find a stream
clear enough for drinking.
Those who are afraid to work in
the mining tunnels can find ready
employment in bodegas, in trans¬
portation concerns, on dredging
vessels; or they can join prospect-
ing and drilling parties.
The revived operation on rich
veins also resulted in the unearth-
ing of equally rich veins of lore and
legend. The plan of the Coco Grove
Syndicate, for example, to excavate
the whole poblacion has led added
credence to the popular belief that
under the town site are gold depo¬
sits of untold value. Under the
Catholic church is believed to re¬
pose two cows of solid gold. A gold
hen and an umbrella of the same
material have likewise descended to
the bottom of the Malaguit river.
it is believed by many of the resi¬
dents.
Paracale hums with the mingled
sounds of tunneling, blasting, drill¬
ing, hoisting, and dredging. Just
how long this will last is open to
conjecture. But one thing is pretty
certain: prosperity is not just
around the corner in Paracale; it
is right in the town now.

Mactan, Cebu, Folk Do Not
Burn Witches --They Blow
Them Up
By RUFINO B. NOEL


Y N the Tagalog regions, persons
suspected of being witches are
A simply flogged or otherwise
chastised with a stout cane. Once
in a while, in other Luzon provinces,
the unlucky suspect is hacked or
drowned. But in Mactan, they say
it with dynamite sticks!
Just in case you have forgotten
your geography, Mactan is the his¬
toric spot where Ferdinand Mage¬
llan met his death in the hands of
Lapulapu’s warriors. It can be
reached by launch from Pier 1 of
Cebu in 30 minutes and for eight


centavos. Once you reach the place
do not make your neighbors think
you dabble in the occult sciences;
that is, if you do not want to be
blown up to shreds.
For the people there are not par¬
ticularly gentle with persons they
suspect of being witches. Some two
years ago, a certain man, who had
previously quarreled with somebo¬
dy, became ill a week after the dis¬
pute. A swelling obstructed his
throat and he could not eat. Medi¬
cos were called but the patient died.
The neighbors believed that the
sick man had been bewitched by

in Mactan island: Basilio Maloloy-on
(top), father, and his son Vicente, who
was seriously injured during the blast.
some usikan (equivalent of the Ta¬
galog mangkukulam), who had been
hired by the other party in the dis¬
pute.
Usik is the power to inflict sick-
ness on others, especially enemies,
it is believed by the superstitious


folk of Cebu. To be an usikan one
must have power over millions of
ants, bees, centipedes, and other
stinging insects, which do the sting-
ing when the victim is asleep.
Hungry for vengeance, the rela¬
tives decided to get even. A dyna¬
mite stick was purchased by the re-
latives—smuggled explosives for
fishing are plenty in the island—
and was planted under the shack of
the suspected usikan one dark
night. An explosion followed short-
ly.
The authorities investigated. But
the case was given up as one of the
perfect crimes; there was no clue.
And nobody wanted to talk too
much, for fear he might be blown
up too.
Then came cases 2 and 3. Same

likewise wounded.

would turn down an offer

Rarer still is the man who, atte¬

of proven merit and ability—chosen
a Malacanang adviser.
That is just what Judge I'ra.

cisco Enage, former member


National Assembly, has done. Al¬
though only made known last week,
he was, last February 12th, appoint-
ed by President Quezon adviser to
the President.
Upon petition of the Secretary
of Justice last Tuesday, however,
Judge Enage has been designated
to make a general inspection of all
the justice of the peace courts in
the Islands and to go minutely into
the records of each justice of the
peace concerned. He will not, there-
fore, owing to the nature of his
work, stay in Malacanang. Instead,
he will make continuous trips, from
one end of the Islands to another,
until he finishes his inspection and
makes his recommendations.
By law, the President is granted
one year from the inauguration of
the Commonwealth, within which
to appoint justices of the peace.
President Quezon thought it best
to first go over the official records
of each probable appointee, and to
find out likewise the moral con¬
duct of each municipal judge. That,
in brief, will form the subject of

YT has been said by those in the
legal profession, that if amor
propio were not so much flat¬
tered, there wou’d be fewer suits
for judges to try and, possibly, no
cases at all for the average law¬
yer to handle. As it is, amor propio
or, as the dictionary says, self-love,
conceitedness, oftentimes causes
a man to lose his bearing just be¬
cause he is so bent on making
the other fe low see who’s in the
right, just for the principle of the
thing.
That is why a simple case, or an
easy ownership dispute, is brought
to court, becomes intricate and—
costly! A'l because of amor pro¬
pio! Litigants often say, “Oh, the
cost of the thing is nothing.” Or
“Why, I can give it to him. But I
can’t let him have it for the princi¬

ple of the thing.” And so the dis¬
pute is brought from one court
and elevated to the next higher
one.
They forget the size of the liti¬
gation costs and attorney’s fees
they have to pay. Money is always
spent for complaints, expenses of
witnesses, court appearances, ap¬
peals, bills of exceptions, print¬
ing of briefs. Yet a man doesn’t
mind, so long as his amor propio is
served.
Twenty-Meter Land Suit
Appellate Judge Mariano A. Al¬
bert still vivid’y recalls a case of
too much amor prop'o. He was a
practising attorney in Tayabas when
a client approached him. It was
simply a question of possession and
ownership of a piece of land, out¬
side the town, twenty meters long
and just one meter wide at its
widest point.
The pa’ntiff, in the case, fenced
his land and knowingly included the
disputed portion. The defendant
(Judge Albert’s client) pulled the
fence off and set it back one meter.
He told the plaintiff the land was
his. But the latter was obstinate.
He filed a suit for forcible entry.
Judge A’bert, thinking discretion
was the better part of valor, ad¬
vised his client to give the case up
because he would certainly spend
more for the litigation than the
actual price of the disputed lot.
“No, I can’t let him do that to
me,” the client insisted. “I could
have easily given the lot to him.
But I can’t think of him cheating
me and telling me the land belongs
to him!


So the case was brought to court,
tried for quite a while, until fin¬
ally Judge Albert won it. By the
time the case was decided both litig-
ants had spent a lot of money.
Hundreds Spent for ₱30
IGHT here in Manila, a man
u spent several hundred pesos
for the services of a prominent
lawyer to retain possession of thirty
pesos.
In the mentioned case, the plain¬
tiff was a mango grove owner in
Zambales. The price of mangoes
in the province being low, he en¬
tered into a verbal contract with a
friend who owned a truck. The
friend was to take the mangoes to
Manila free of charge and se’l the
fruits there. They would split the
proceeds equally afterwards.
So the mangoes were brought to
the city and stored in the truck
owner’s house for a few days.
Eventually the mangoes were sold.
But when the plaintiff mango owner
came for his share, the defendant
truck-owner said so many mangoes
had turned rotten that there had
been absolutely no profits at all.
The truth, however, was that the
mangoes were sold for P60. So the
plaintiff sued him for P30. The de¬
fendant hired a prominent lawyer.
The trial consumed about two days
of the court’s time, and would have
consumed more time had not the
judge become exasperated and told
the litigants that more important
cases were waiting to be heard.
The defendant, of course, lost the
suit. That was not his only loss
though. He paid for the court fees,


and it was understood his lawyer
never accepted a fee lower than
P200 for each appearance.
Flush-Bowl Controversy
OME of the cases which had
S been brought to court because
of amor propio were pretty foolish.
There was that case about the re¬
covery of a second-hand flush bowl.
Each party alleged ownership. Just
as the judge was about to make his
decision, a third party intervened
and claimed the flush bowl as his!
That started the legal rumpus all
over again. That flush bowl, being
old, would have cost no more than

-Fit is true, as one saying goes,
that good lawyers make good
judges, then Judge Domingo
Imperial of the newly established
Court of Appeals is well qualified
for the position which he presently
holds.
As practising attorney for twenty
four years, Judge Domingo Impe¬
rial has won the high respect and
admiration of not only the mem¬
bers of the law profession but also
of judges. The members of the
Supreme Court praise him highly
and commend his appointment to
the Court of Appeals.
Said one practising at¬
torney from Albay of him:
“Among the many lawyers
who are active in the Bicol
region during the last
twenty years, Judge Impe¬
rial easily stands out as
among the foremost. There
is hardly an important town
in the whole . region in
which the fame of former
Senator Imperial as a law¬
yer is unknown or un¬
heard.” In support of this,
he pointed out that Judge
Imperial was elected to the
Philippine Senate in 1934
partly because of his repu¬
tation as the “best, or one
of the best lawyers the Bi¬
colandia has ever pro¬
duced."
But his being a good
lawyer is not the sole rea¬
son why Secretary of Jus¬
tice Yulo recommended his
appointment to President
Quezon and why local bar
associations have similarly
approved of his appoint-
ment to the Court of Ap-
peals.
As a lawyer, it was
brought out when his name
was being considered by
Malacanang for the appel¬
late court, Judge Domingo
Imperial had strictly ad¬
hered to the ethics of his
profession and had metic¬
ulously avoided the temp-
tations to which many lawyers have
fallen. He not merely worked to
better his standing in the profes¬
sion but also to better the standing
of his profession. As lawyer and
as politician, Judge Imperial, also
according to investigators who
locked into his records when his
name was proposed for appoint¬
ment, has behind him a record
which is absolutely above re¬
proach. When he was a member
of the Philippine Senate, it is even
recalled that he kept himself from
common political practices. To the
chagrin of his many political lead¬
ers, he is known to have refused to
recommend followers and friends
whom he believed were not fitted


for positions to which they were
being recommended. Even as a po¬
litician, he refused to "play poli¬
tics."
Judge Domingo Imperial was
born in Daraga, Albay, on August
4, 1890. He is the third child of
David Imperial, a merchant and a
former employee of the Spanish
government, and Lina Fernandez.
He studied in the private school
of Legaspi, Albay, and later in the
Colegio Filipino, and San Beda,
Manila. He also studied in the
Liceo de Manila and obtained his


A.B. degree from the University
of Santo Tomas in 1908. The year
after his graduation, he was en¬
gaged to teach in the Colegio de
Nuestra Senora del Rosario and in
the Colegio Mercantil. Imperial,
however, did not remain in the job
long. He resigned from his teach¬
ing position after one year and de¬
cided to study medicine.
Judge Imperial would have been
a doctor, and would have been hear¬
ing the complaints of sick and suf¬
fering patients instead of those of
litigants were it not for a trivial
incident which altered the whole
course of his life
One registration day, he related,
he went to the University of Santo


Tomas and together with about a
hundred others stormed the door of
the institution seeking admission
into the college of medicine. There
were too many applicants, however,
and the day ended without his get¬
ting the necessary permit to attend
the classes. He succeeded as far
as the door of the school. Imperial
returned home in the afternoon a
bit tired and dejected. He was
told, and so were his companions,
to return the following day but in¬
stead of going back to the Univer¬
sity of Santo Tomas, he went to
the La Jurisprudencia (a
law school) and finding
registration there quite
easy and less tiresome, he
immediately enrolled. He
studied law.
Imperial finished his
course in 1912. He ob¬
tained the highest rating in
the bar examinations the
same year. Imperial then
went to Albay and formed
a partnership with Atty.
Salvador Imperial, a relative
of his. At one time also,
he was associated with for
mer Senator Leoncio Impe¬
rial, who, by the way, had
been also a law partner of
Supreme Court Justice Car¬
los Imperial. The partner¬
ship was dissolved after¬
wards and Domingo Impe¬
rial practised the profes¬
sion independently. There
were several offers for him
to come to Manila and join
Manila law firms but as he
was already enjoying wide
practice in his home prov¬
ince, he remained there.
When the political con-
troversy over the Hare¬
Hawes-Cutting law broke
out, he was invited to en¬
ter politics and carry the
anti banner in the sixth
senatorial district to oppose
the candidacy of former
House Floor Leader Pedro
Sabido. Although he came
from the ranks of the old
Democrata party, and although he
had no political experience, he won
in the elections.
As a member of the Philippine
Senate, he was chairman of the com-
mittees on appointments and navi¬
gation, and member of several im¬
portant committees. When his
term as senator expired, he resumed
the practise of law in the law firm
which he formed in 1930 with for¬
mer Rep. Jose T. Surtida, which
partnership was dissolved upon his
appointment as judge of the Court
of Appeals.
Judge Imperial is married to the
former Miss Concepcion del Rosa¬
rio of Ligao, Albay. The Imperials
were married on June 8, 1918, and

Superintendent Salvador danced

Governor Sevilla, still laughing,

ITA accepted Leon because
Filo no longer loved her. Bold
IV statement, Biting truth. Just
like saying, it rains. Modifications
may be made with the addition of
more words, but they do not change
the essential.
Rita’s affair with Filo was the
usual kind—among office workers.
You know: two people working in
the same office, seeing each other
twelve hours a day, thinking of
each other so much they thought
they were in love. There had been
holding of hands, stolen kisses, all
those trivial little things that hap-
pen when one of the two in love
asks for so much and the loved and
loving one gives—well, so much.
Everybody knew about Filo and
Rita’s affair.
Like all things it ended. How
or why, even the two were in doubt.
All they knew was that they parted
and neither could say why.
Filo was used to this thing—he
had had many affairs like this be¬
fore. He would probably have ma¬
ny more—in fact he was quite sure
he would. So his version could not
have been unaccompanied by re¬
marks hinting at depreciation and
such—so natural to those who think
all this: loving and forgetting as
so much routine.


Rita could no more have told a co¬
herent tale than could a dog, with
a stump-tail, express all that it
feels. There is such a lack of clear
sight when one has just broken off
a "first" love-affair.
Her version would necessarily
have been weighted with allusions
to broken dreams and all such twad¬
dle,
Leon’s version of the affair would
necessarily be love—love others
who knew of Filo would not under¬
stand. But Leon would naturally
allude to limitations of human un¬
derstanding and human prejudice.
Leon, you see, was in love with
Rita.
So that leaves only me.
A bystander is usually more in a
position to tell details of things—
give conclusions—than the pawns
in the game.
The affair of Rita and Filo end¬
ed because she, giving so much, ex¬
pected a like return. And he, ask¬
ing so much, did not give as much
as he took.
That was the situation in a nut¬
shell. Rita wanted the thrills of
romance and the security of love—
and all its petty bonds: marriage
vows and such. To that end, with
that belief, she gave.
Filo wanted nothing more than


a few kisses, a few other things.
All this he wanted with the least
amount of effort necessary.
So they parted. Just like that.
With so many tears, with so little
of words.
Not that Filo shed any tear.
Not he. Within the month he was
going through the same routine
with Nina. Outside of the compa
ny this time. There had been grum
bles from the others in the compa
ny, about Filo’s affair with Rita.
If such an affair had been among
the conductors and drivers and
other lesser fry, there would have
been the summary, three days to
get married in or get out!
But Filo was Filo. He had an in
Human rules are like spider
webs; strong enough to catch the
comparatively harmless fly, yet not
even a nuisance to the crow that
flies? through.
Once Rita took a call from Nina.
It was for Filo. She called him to
the 'phone. She was smiling as she
did so, but the edges of her lips
were sort of turned down as if brac¬
ing a smile that threatened to col¬
lapse.
So matters stood until December.
Barrio fiesta. Beauty-contests,
beauty-rackets.
Rita was elected beauty queen.


Not that she looked better than the
rest of the candidates. It was just
that her Nang Tutang and Noy
lyan had enough money—enough
credit when the money gave out—
to persuade the people to forget the
limitations of her face.
Anyway, who ever heard of a
beauty contest being won by mere
beauty. Not in this part of the
country.
Beauty is—well, just something
to look at, hope for. Money gives a
lustre to beauty that even brains
do not.
Did I mention Rita’s Nang Tu¬
tang and her Noy lyan? She wasn’t
an orphan. It was just that she
always seemed to have more affec-
tion for her aunt and uncle than
for her own parents. Perhaps be¬
cause her parents were not well-to¬
do.
In the office on the morning af¬
ter the election, there was the
usual good-natured congratulations
and the just-as-usual smirking, de¬
preciatory remarks, belittling of the
honor.
Hi, Rita, you'll be queenie now.
Don’t forget us.
Don’t be silly. It really is no¬
thing to talk of. Don’t forget to be
at the coronation.

Zig-Zag Hotel, Baguio—
EHE one occupying the room
next to mine is an American
 lady who has a library
which, for an away-from-home, is
remarkably large. It includes not
only older successes by Lady Mu¬
rasaki, Tolstoy, Butler, France,
Cabell, and others, but such current
or recent sensations as Lin Yu¬
tang’s "My Country and My Peo¬
ple,”
Woollcott’s
“While Rome
Burns,” Briffault’s “Europa,” Shee¬
an’s "Personal History,” Prokosch’s
“The Asiatics,” Mrs. Lindbergh’s
“North to the Orient,” Davis’ "Ho¬
ney in the Horn," etc.
Their gracious owner does not
believe in walling up oases. On the
contrary, she takes pleasure in of-
fering every traveler who chances to
pass by the blessings of her wells,
fountains, and pools. So don’t be
surprised if this column becomes,
for a while, like a section for lit-
erary aperitifs.
THE LADY herself, by the way,
writes for publication occasionally.
And of course she is interested not
only in literature but in those en¬
gaged in its production. She has
talked with me about several Fili¬
pino writers, among them Manuel
E. Arguilla, Bienvenido N. San¬
tos, and N. V. M. Gonzales.
Once, she happened to mention
that she met John Cowper Powys
in St. Paul, Minn. Naturally, I
plied her with questions about him.
He struck her, she said, as a very
tense man. Dark, black-haired, me¬
dium-sized, “he looked Gallic though
an Englishman. When introduced,
he looked at you piercingly, shook
your hand heartily, and all in all
acted in such a way that you were
assured that meeting you really
mattered to him—that he was de-
lighted to know you. Always, his
dark eyes glowed like live coals and
his cheeks were flushed, and the
way he lectured was certainly any¬
thing but listless or monotonous.
“After a lecture, the color in his
cheeks was more pronounced. This
was partly due, probably, to his be¬
ing afflicted with tuberculosis at
the time...”
Tuberculosis. And that was over
a decade and a half ago, when the
means of fighting the white plague
were not so numerous and effica¬
cious as to-day. Yet, the Thomas
Hardy of our times—as I believe he
has been called—is still very much
alive.
Well, one might expect that. For
even by just reading his works, one
gets the impression that the author
of “Wolf Solent” is so full of zest,
a "lust for life,” that it would take
very, very much to still his bound-


ing pulse. Science is not the only
sword that can parry the scythe of
the Grim Reaper.
ANOTHER proof of that: Some¬
where here in the City of Pines,
there is a mestiza who was sent up
more than three years ago "with a
death sentence over her head," as a
friend put it. The doctors had giy¬
en her just six months to live, but
if anything, this brown-haired, ha¬
zel-eyed young lady is healthier
now than when she arrived at the
favorite summer resort in this
country.
I don’t think that Baguio’s ch¬
mate should get the most credit fon


that. It is my belief that it is her
unquenchable cheerfulness, more
than anything else, which has car¬
ried her this far. It would not
amaze me if it brought her to the
point she deserves to attain.
Staying in an out-of-the-way
place, she spends most of each day
reclining on a couch in a garden
which is beautiful but which can be
depressing if you are sick and have
been in it through day after day
for almost four years. None the
less, complaints come not easily, if
at all, from those lips which can
smile so readily, banter so spirited¬
ly, and sing so fetchingly...
LET ME close for this week by tel¬
ling you of a kindred spirit—of an¬
other who could laugh in the face of
even the dark angel. He was "a
blue-eyed, blond-haired Norwegian,
John Frantzen," and I learned of
him in “SOS to the Rescue," by
Karl Baarslag, a book about the he¬
roism of wireless operators at sea.
I quote direct:


At 10 A. M. March 2, 1922, Chief
Operator Hansen of the SS Estho¬
nia received an SOS from the
Grontoft saying she was in distress
and unmanageable about 600 miles
east of Cape Race or 48 miles from
the Esthonia. Captain Jorgensen
turned his ship about into the teeth
of a wild northeaster; he had been
making barely five knots. He told
Hansen to tell the Grontoft’s ope¬
rator that "we are on the way to
help him.”
Anxiously and silently Hansen

Frantzen of the Grontoft: "God pi¬

“The old man thinks it may breeze

another SOS followed by, "Well, the

later he came on the air with an¬

FN the morning the first thing
he had done was to look at the
I weather report. The paper
had said “Unsettled,” and he had
worried. It meant rain; it meant
maybe a fog, bad weather, and they
wouldn’t be able to go. She’d come
over to him and say: "Jimmy, I
guess we’d better not go. Maybe
another Saturday afternoon.” Dur¬
ing the morning at the office he
stepped out every few minutes on
this excuse and that to look at the
sky high up between the roofs.
Sometimes it looked white, color¬
less, at other, times a dirty cloud
would be seen above the canyon.
And Jimmy went back to the office.
Maybe they would have to call it
off. She wouldn’t want to go. It’s
no fun to go to the country on a
rainy day. She’d come over and
say: “We’d better not go."
But as the morning went on the
sky cleared. Shadows came into
the office rooms and bright spots
of yellow sun, and a breeze blew
that cleared the foggy air. Every¬
one looked more cheerful. Every¬
one said: This will be a fine Satur¬
day afternoon. We can go to the
game, or walk on the streets, or
just spend the afternoon doing
nothing on this fine day. Jimmy
felt easier. Probably they'd go


now. She couldn’t be able to find
an excuse for not going. They’d go
to the country. It sounded funny
to go to the country. He had
said to her: “Maybe you’d better
not tell the other fellows where
you’re going with me. Maybe you'd
better tell them we’re going to a
movie or something. But we won’t.
We’ll go to the country.”

She had said all right. She had
said her mother would make some
sandwiches, and she’d wrap them
up to look like a shoe box, so no¬
body would know; and he’d better
meet her on the corner outside the
cigar store. Yes, she had admitted.
It would look funny just going to
the country for no reason at all.
So they went to the country.
They met outside of the cigar store,
and he quickly turned around to see
that no one from the office was

much room there; lots of people on
the ferry and lots of noise; people
talking; children shouting at the
gulls, and the ships around, an or¬
chestra of three Italians playing
popular songs. She was telling
him all sorts of things, gossip about
the office, and about her girl
friends, what she had done last
night, whom she had been with,
what they had said, and what she
had said. She was animated, hap-
py, her head turned up looking at
his mouth, as if wanting to see
what he would answer. Jimmy had

other was in his pocket, holding a

What to do when they got to wher-

know either. They would eat their
lunch. And then... They couldn’t
begin to chase each other, after
all. He had no idea what they
would do. Anyway the idea of the
country now that they were ap-
proaching it frightened him more
and more. He was uncomfortable.
He wished he had not suggested it.
He liked the girl, liked her as he
liked any other girl whom he not
yet felt fully. But what would
they talk about, what would they
do, once the sandwiches were eaten,

locking. She took his arm, and
they hurried toward the ferry. Out-
side it was nice. Sun shining; sha¬
dows black; people walking on the
streets happy, hurrying home, not
wanting to miss any of this fine
day.
They were on the ferry, sitting
upstairs on the outside, Jimmy and
the girl, arms interlinked, very close


This is what the country meant to
Jimmy: A boy scout camp when a
little boy. A ball game outside the
city. A rough-made diamond, a
wire screen back of the home plate,
and beyond, grass, trees, and a vil¬
lage. Joy-riding with a friend
whose father owned a car. A black
road; cars passing; villages passed;
a couple of girls they had tried un¬
successfully to pick up. Jimmy was
now going to the country with the
girl and he did not know where he
was going.
Otherwise it would have been the
movies. They would have gone into
the dark theatre, gotten themselves
a seat at the side near the rear. For
a while they would have looked at
the picture. Then their hands
would have met. Then after a
while he would have kissed, or
would have tried to kiss her. Then
they would have gone out. He'd
have taken her home. Gone into
the dark parlor. And have kissed
her more.
The girl whom Jimmy was tak¬
ing to the country was a file clerk
in the same Company where Jimmy
was an assistant bookkeeper. Her
name was Marion. Jimmy had not
known she worked in the same place
he did when he had met her at a
dance of the Social Club. He had
met her, had taken her home, had
tried to kiss her, had done so, had
tried something else and had been
told No. He had seen her the next
day at the office. There were hun¬
dreds working for the Company.
That was why Jimmy had not met
her before.
Of course where they were going
he did not know. He had an idea
they would take a car once they ar-
rived on the other side. And this
they did when the ferry wedged in-
to the slip and every one crowded
out. The car was full, and they

F only Hitler, Mussolini, and

A deign to have a heart to heart
talk with Nathaniel Peffer about
the fallacy of conquest and get con¬
vinced! Or refer to Mr. Peffer’s
The Fallacy of Conquest (Harper's,
January, 1936)! The need for ter¬
ritorial expansion has been of late
the classic excuse for a well-armed
nation to crack down on a defense¬
less one. That’s why Italians are
chasing Ethiopians all over Abys¬
sinia and the Japanese are chas¬
ing the Chinese off North China.
But Mr. Peffer claims this all
wrong, because this expansion busi¬
ness never pays. Said Mr. Peffer:
“For fifty years Italy has strained
its resources to win an empire, os¬
tensibly to relieve the pressure of
population. It joined in the scram-
b'e for colonies in Africa after
1880, and fought wars against Abys¬
sinia and Tripoli. But in 1914 there
were in all the colonies which it had
won in Africa only some 8,000 Ital¬
ians. There were fifty times that
number in New York state alone...
It was in order to win an empire
that Germany challenged British
naval supremacy and foredoomed
the World War. And in 1914, at
the outbreak of the war which had
been brought on by lust for col¬
onies, there were in all the German
colonies in Africa—900,000 square
miles in extent—about 22,000 Ger¬
mans and in all the German colonies
in other parts of the world just
2000 more. There were more than
that number of Germans between
80th and 90th Streets on Manhat¬
tan Island... At the cost of some
300,000 men Japan won South Man¬
churia from Russia in 1905... It
must, say the Japanese apologists;
for the population has been increas¬
ing at the rate of from 600,000 to
1,000,000 a year for a generation.
But in 1930, 25 years after the
acquisition of South Manchuria,


The Japanese are sllcing off parts of a
weak neighbor’s territory.


only 200,000 Japanese had settled
there—fewer than had died in the
war to acquire it. There were half
as many Japanese in California
alone.
“Against the policy of seizing
territories in order that they may
serve as markets for exports...
(there is the example of) Great


Some Italian soldiers. Italy justifes
Ethiopian invasion an the ground of need
for expansion.


Britain. No nation could have more,
bigger, and richer colonies. India is
a British colony with a population
of 350,000,000. And what nation is
now capturing that market? Not
England, but Japan. The Malay
Peninsula is a British possession.
Not England, but Japan is selling
goods there now.
“Expansion in order to secure
access to supplies of raw materials
still has a certain validity .. (But)
for practical purposes no nation can
maintain a monopoly of all resources
within its control without provok-
ing retaliation by other countries at
points where it is vulnerable. Great
Britain controls the rubber of Ma¬
laya, but it had come to terms with
the United States, the principal
consumer of rubber. Access to raw
materials is of limited advantage
unless accompanied by command of
markets, which in turn depends
upon an efficient, broad-based in¬
dustrial structure... What nation
could be more replenished than
Great Britain with all that is sup¬
posed to endow a people with wealth
and power? And how flourishing
is Great Britain just now? How
secure is its empire and how stable
its economic organism? Suppose
Germany or even italy should suc¬


ceed in supplanting England, carv¬
ing out as great an empire as the
British; how much better off would
it be?”
If only the Italians and the Ger¬
mans and the Japanese, especially,
would get convinced, we would not
be so jittery around here in the
Philippines.

FIFTEEN days ago, on Feb. 12th,
the U.S., the Philippines, and
other places where the U.S. flag
flutters in the breeze celebrated the
birthday of Lincoln. On the sub-
ject of liberty, Lincoln said the fol¬
lowing in an address delivered at
Sanitary Fair, Baltimore, April
18, 1864: “The shepherd drives the
wolf from the sheep’s throat, for
which the sheep thanks the shep-
herd as his liberator, while the wolf
denounces him for the same act, as
the destroyer of liberty... Plainly
the sheep and the wolf are not
agreed upon a definition of the
word liberty; and precisely the
same difference prevails to-day
among us human creatures.
(From Teachers' Oath by Carl
Joachim Friedrich, Harper's Maga¬
zine, January, 1936.)
Said 72 years ago! And the
wolves and the sheep are no nearer
a common meaning of liberty than
they were at the time of Lincoln!
NAS the capitalistic world at
last made peace with Soviet
Russia or are the Russian commun¬
ists having a change of heart? Eu¬
gene Lyons says in a recent issue
of Seribner’s Magazine: “Recent
dispatches out of Moscow convey an
impression of far-reaching changes
in mood and manners. The lighter
side of mortal existence, such as
dancing, comedy, romantic love,
neat dress, are finding indulgence.

Y OUNG Filipino lawyers, you
are not the only ones down
I at tne hecls in the wond.
This from “Don't Be A Lawyer" by
Anonymous in the January issue of
The American Mercury:
“I and most of my lawyer friends
would quickly abandon our practi¬
ces for a salaried job, if we had
the chance... Many barely earn
their keep: they walk around with
nickles in their pockets. Most of
them are receiving assistance from
parents, in-laws or wives. They no
longer harbor any illusion about
deriving a steady income from law
but live only in hope of a break,
i. e., procure a steady job or a po¬
litical sinecure, marrying a rich
girl or falling heir to a fortune.
Recently a prominent young attor¬
ney in my town quit the profession
to become a shoe salesman. Others


have gone into inc. booksel¬
ling, and storeke.

the happy proprie
ruit and
vegetable stand."


Within the shell, will be a solid
gold collar to further confine the
Gamma rays of radium, thus pre¬
venting injury to the operators from
spreading rays.
The employment of so great a
quantity of radium within a single
bomb permits operation at a great¬
er distance from the patient, and at
the same time produces a more ef¬
fective treatment at greater depths
below the body surface.

Poor Policy
Radio Manila or KZRM, so I read
recently will receive considerably
less government help from the
radio license fund this year. I ask,
is the P I. radio commission try-
ing to ruin broadcasting in the Is¬
lands? I ask this because only a
few days earlier, I read the news
that there are now several thou¬
sand more radio sets registered
with the Bureau of Posts than be¬
fore. This means more radio li¬
cense fees collected.
I don’t, however, like this radio
license. I think the advertisers
should foot the bill as they do in
the United States. But, as long as
they won’t do it, and since radio
licenses are required everywhere
else in the world, I am willing to
pay mine here. Radio Manila has
done fine broadcasting and cer¬
tainly can do better if given some
real help.

I’m sure, would enlighten the
masses.
Through your columns, al'ow me
to congratulate you and your staff
artist for the splendid, smart-
looking, peachy new “dress” (cover


design to you) of  , which
started with its carnival number.
I’m sure that thousands of your
readers in the South, particularly in
Cebu city where there are thousands
of   "addicts,” have noth-
ing but praise and appreciation for
your magazine’s recent improve¬
ment and “garb.” The new cover
design is worth framing for home
or office decoration.
And why not request Hon. Osias
to write some of his illuminating
stuff too for  ? We want
to hear from him some of these days
through your columns.

This One For Daguio
Daguio’s article in your GRAPH-
IC issue of January 30th, is the best
thing that could be said of Villa and
his doctrines. It is a sincere and
faithful portrayal of our self-an¬
nointed hero. Let me say, however,
that I like both of them. I admire
Villa as a short story writer and
Daguio as a poet.
But while Daguio can write a
story of Villa’s stamp, Villa surely
cannot write poetry of Daguio’s
depth and beauty. Villa invents,
Daguio creates. Certainly, either
one has not written consistently
good works, but whatever crimes
have been committed by both against
literature surely Daguio’s are less.
Daguio has written with more sense
because he is more sensible; he has
given us more beautiful works be¬
cause his soul is more beautiful.
To sum it all: Daguio is the bet-
ter writer.

Executive lmpartiality
There is no doubt that President
Quezon, with no political reelection
to look forward to, is making good
his promise to the people to uphold
justice and impartiality for the
common good.
Curtly dismissing Judge Ge¬
ronimo Paredes from the judiciary
well affords a good example. The
investigation of oil land leases is
another. When the rice importation
tangle came up. Director Cornelio
Ba’maceda of the bureau of com¬
merce was immediately suspended
and investigated.
The Chief Executive has also
turned his attention against gam¬
bling, ordering a relentless war
against it. Certainly, this order
will affect some prominent provin¬

good deal to produce this impos¬
ing effect.
The floor plan includes five
rooms, not counting the porch.
There are two bedrooms, with the
bathroom and toilet between them
The dining room has a balcony at
one end which is decorative as
well as useful. The doors to it
may be completely opened during
warm afternoons to al'ow the
breeze to blow into the room. The
kitchen in the corner has a very
excellent location.
The bay window will appeal to
the housewife. Cushioned seats


may be built under it, with shelves
at the bottom for books, news¬
papers, and magazines not in
use. At the front of this seat may
be placed a round table. A sofa
in the alcove between the door to
the bathroom and the door to the
smaller bedroom and a few
straight-back chairs will complete
the furnishings of the living
room.
If privacy during meal hours is
desired, a sliding pair of doors
may take the place of the arch
between the living room and the
dining room.
The foundation of this house is

of adobe stones, finished with
cement. The walls as well as the
partitions and the ceiling are of
wall-board. The floors of the
porch, the bathroom, the kitchen,
the steps, and the service porch
are of cement, with tiles, if de¬
sired.
Note the compactness of the de-
sign. Every inch of floor space
is utilized to advantage. The
front porch has more than a prac¬
tical purpose: it serves also to
balance the dining room wing.

Tomatoes Are In Season
Preserve Them For Future Use


—Y HEN tomatoes are in sea¬
son, as they are these
Wlays they are so pienuicol
that although cheap, vendors can¬
not dispose of them all. House¬
wives buy only those that they can
use for a day or two and growers
pick them and continue sending
them to the market, so you see to¬
matoes rotting away in their bas¬
kets, if not on their stems. Then
when tomatoes are scarce and are
very dear, housewives either have
to do without them or pay a high
price for them. Cannot something
be done with this situation?
Something can be done: preserve
the tomatoes for future use. Be¬
low are a few recipes that are
easy to follow. The tomatoes have
to be weighed because they vary
in sizes.
Tomato Preserves
1 pound small, yellow toma¬
toes
lemon, ripe
3,4 pound of sugar
Select the small yellow tomatoes
that are about the size of ciruelas
or cineguelas. Place them in a ket¬
tle and pour boiling water over
them. Cover the kettle tightly for
a few minutes. Then quickly drain
off the hot water and replace it
with cold water. This treatment
will loosen the skins of the toma¬
toes. Peel them, being careful not
to break them. If any are found
with the skins still unloosened,
treat them again with boiling wa¬
ter. Place the sugar and the peeled
tomatoes in a crock or enamel bowl
and let stand overnight. In the
morning, drain off the juice and


A tomato plant heavily laden with
fruit.
boil this juice rapidly until it spins
a thread. Add the tomatoes and the
thinly sliced lemon (with the peel
on). Cook the mixture until the
syrup is clear and thick. Seal in
clean hot jars.
Green Tomato Preserves
8 pounds of green tomatoes
6 pounds of sugar
1 tablespoon of ginger, chopped
6 lemons
Wash the tomatoes, remove any
dark parts about the stems, and


weigh them. Cover them with boil¬
ing water, let stand for 5 minutes,
drain, and then slice or cut them
into halves into an enameled pre¬
serving kettle. Place the thinly
sliced lemons on top of the tomatoes
and over the lemons, the sugar with
the ginger sprinkled over it. Let
the mixture stand overnight. In
the morning, drain and boil the sy¬
rup for ten minutes. Skim, add the
tomatoes, and cook rapidly until
they are clear or transparent. Pour
into clean, hot jars, and seal.
Cold Tomato Catchup
(In Quantity)
1 peck or 32 cups of ripe to¬
matoes
2 cups of strong vinegar
Salt, cloves, pepper, garlic, all¬
spice
This is a recipe supposed to have
been used in the kitchen of George
Washington.
Wash the tomatoes and force
them through a wire sieve, then
strain through a jelly-bag or thick
muslin. The liquid is not used in
the catchup.
Thin the pulp with the vinegar.
Season with salt, pepper, garlic,
allspice, and cloves. Bottle in ster¬
ilized containers and seal. This
catchup is said to retain all the
flavor of the tomatoes and is ex-


cellent for flavoring soups and
sauces.
-Tomato Chutney
1 pounds of ripe tomatoes
1 pound of apples
2 onions, chopped fine
2 cups strong vinegar
tablespoons salt
2 cups brown sugar
I cup seeded raisins
1 teaspoon cinamon
1 teaspoon mustard
1 teaspoon cayenne
Chop the vegetables and then
the apples. Combine all the ingre¬
dients and cook until the mixture is
thick and clear. Seal in hot, clean
jars.
Tomatoes should be eaten raw,
if possible, because they contain vi¬
tamins that are destroyed by heat.
There is nothing more delicious or
attractive than a salad of firm.
ripe tomatoes and lettuce, served
with a little mayonnaise dressing.
Tomatoes are most congenial and
can be combined with many other
vegetables, particularly corn and
peas, and foods, like meats and
salted fish to which they contribute
their own particular flavor. Have
you ever tried a luncheon salad of
tomatoes and salmon or of tomatoes
and crabmeat? Our own tomatoes,
salted (red) eggs, and tinapa dish
is quite peerless.

rr HE low decolletage of the
European evening gowns
A that our young women are
beginning to affect has made
them conscious of that part of the
human body from the waist up to
the neck. A hollow chest and
rounded shoulders do not show off
even the best cut evening gown to
advantage. The only way to im¬
prove this part of the body, espe¬
cially the bustline, is to develop
the pectoral muscles which run
from the breastbone to the shoul¬
ders and the muscles of the back.
The muscles of the chest respond
quickly to exercises. The follow¬
ing exercises by Dorothy Nye to
whose studio in New York women
go for corrective exercises, will
give you back, shoulders, and
chest to be proud of, if these ex¬
ercises are performed every day
faithfully before an open window
for a period of at least three
months.
Exercise 1. This developes the
muscles of the u p p er back,
stretches the neck muscles, and
gets directly to muscles of the
chest and bust. Lie flat on your
back, with your arms stretched
outward, palms up. Raise the
shoulders upward, chin tilted up,
weight on the back of the head.
Lower your shoulders and chest
on the mat and relax. Repeat 5
times.
Exercise 2. The resisting of
arms in this exercise strengthens
important chest muscles. On your
hands and knees, fingers flat and
pointing inward, back flat, head
up, bend the torso downward un¬
til your chest almost touches the
floor, resisting this motion with


but it does wonders to flat, weak
chest. With arms out at side,
move them to the front. While
doing this, turn your palms first
up and then down and at the same
time resist the movement. Bring
the hands in to the chest, raising
the chest and bust upward. Now
return to the first position. You
must r es is t all movements


your arms all the time. Do this
exercise 4 times, rest, and then
repeat 4 times.
Exercise 3. This exercise de-
finitely develops the pectoral
muscles and indirectly reaches
the arm muscles. With bust
lifted, shoulders back, arms bent
at elbows, ciasp your fingers in
each other. Resist with one arm
while you are trying to pull the
other across the body. While you
resist the arm that is pulling the
other arm across your chest, you
should feel the muscle pull be¬
tween your shoulder blades. Al¬
ternate the arm pulling 4 times,
rest, then repeat 4 times.


Exercise No. 3


sufficient elimination, which is
the cause of a yellow tinge in the
skin: Lie flat on your back, raise
the knees, draw the small of the
back flat against the bed (this
draws the abdomen in and up),
draw in the abdomen as far as
possible, then push out as far
as possible. Do this 15 times.
Then relax for a minute. Now
turn on the right side and draw
the knees up far enough to relax
the abdomen, and again draw the
abdomen in and push it out, in a
rhythmic way. Then take the
knee-chest position—kneeling and
resting the top of your forehead
on the bed—and draw the abdo¬
men in and out as before, curving
your back up and down like a cat.
Do this exercise 15 times. If you
have drunk two glasses of water
before doing this exercise, you
have completely washed the stom-
ach and also strengthened the
back muscles.


Here is an excellent exercise for
relaxation:
Lie flat on your back. Lift the
right leg about two feet from the
bed and let it down slowly, think-
ing lazily of the relaxation of your
toes, then of the ankle, then of the
leg, and lastly of the hip-joint. As
the heel approaches the bed, drop
the foot with a thud like a dead
weight. Give a deep sigh of re¬
lief. Repeat the exercise with the
left leg. Follow with another deep
sigh. When you are relaxed from
the waist down, raise your right
arm two feet from the bed and let
it fall down slowly, as you did with
your legs, thinking first of your
fingers, then of your wrist, then of
your arm, and lastly of your shoul¬
der point. Let the hand tall on the
bed with a thud. Sigh deeply. Re¬
peat the exercise with the left hand
and end it with a deep sigh. Then
rell the eyes ten times to the right
and then ten times to the left.
Close them and let your mind go
blank.
* * *


Exercise No. 4


throughout this exercise. Repeat
5 times.
Exercise 6. Droop your arms,
head, and shoulders forward
Then raise the upper torso high,
pulling in your abdominal mus¬
cles. Raise arms up and drop
your head backward. While you
lift your torso from the "rag doll"
pose, lift your chest high, as if
you were drinking in your first
breath of fresh air. Be sure not
to hunch your shoulders upward.
Do this exercise 5 times, rest,
then repeat 10 times.
These exercises are especially
recommended for the growing
young girl. In connection with
these exercises, good posture
must be observed. They shoulo
be ended with breathing exer¬
cises. Swimming, especially with
breast strokes, is excellent in
place of these exercises, the daily
performance of which may be
tedious to some persons.
Here is a good exercise for in¬


Exercise 4. This fist-pushing
with resistance gets at weak chest
muscles. Place the doubled-up
fist of one hand in the open pa’m
of the other. With your arms
shoulder-high, push the arm to
both sides, resisting through the
movement. Do this exercise till
tired, rest, then repeat.
Exercise 5. This is a hard one

truly baautiful and yauthful in appearance,
the treatment which seems most sensible is
one which will actually remove the akin itself
immediately it hegins to age, fade, coarsen or
discolor. The Mercolizsd Wax treatment wil
remove this outer skin. Mercolized Wax is
put on at night just as you apply cold cream.
and washed off in the morning. It ahsorhs
the dead and half-dead particles, a little each
day, no discomfort heing experienced. With
the disappearance of the ald cuticle, the
newer, healthier skin underneath gradually
appears, richly beautiful with the flush of
youth. Mercolized Wax bhrings out the hid-

mistaken for either Chinese or Ja¬
panese, if not for Hawaiians, Mrs.
Flora A. Ylagan began when in¬
terviewed a day after her arrival
in Manila after eight months of
traveling in Europe, the United
States, and the East.
To prevent people abroad from
mistaking her for either Chinese or
Japanese, she tried to appear Fili¬
pino as much as possible by wear¬
ing the Filipino dress whenever it
was convenient. She wore the Eu¬
ropean dress only when traveling
by train or by motor and during
the cold season. Even then, some¬
times she wore the Filipino dress.
She remembers how much she shiv¬
ered one evening when she went to
the opera in her most attractive
terno, but the discomfort of the
cold on the way was forgotten when
she saw how much attention her
costume was attracting. Contrary
to what many women have said, she
did not find it uncomfortable nor
inconvenient to wear the Filipino
dress abroad. She took fourteen
ternos with her and carried them
around the world in suitcases to


delicate softness that add


so to your charm...benefits

Mrs. Flora A. Ylagan:
ATMANOADROAD
Wears Filipino Dress During
Travels


Mrs. Flora A. Ylagan is, perhaps, the
first Filipino woman to travel abraad with
fourteen ternos as part of her luggage
She wore the Filipine dress mast of the
time and did not find it inconvenient.
prevent the camisas from getting
wrinkled.
Mrs. Ylagan had the honor of re-
presenting the Philippines at the
eightieth birthday anniversary cel¬
ebration of the Y W C.A. in Lon¬
don last year. There were fifty-two
nations represented, including China,
Japan, the East Indies, India, and
the Philippines. The celebration
took place in the famous Albert Hall
from three o’clock in the afternoon.
There was an impressive ceremony
of lighting the eighty candles on the
huge birthday cake, followed by a


colorful pageant in which the re-
presentatives of the fifty-two na¬
tions took part, each in her native
costume.
Commenting on the order of Hit-
ler prohibiting the employment of
women whose husbands are earning
enough to support their respective
families, she thinks that this order
is an excellent solution of an acute
unemployment problem. It is un¬
fair for a woman whose husband is
earning enough to deprive a man of
work through which to support his
family. It is unfair, she says, for
any woman who does not need the
money, to fill a position that can
be filled by a man. She thinks that
in positions that do not require
special skill or knowledge, prefer¬
ence of employment should be given
to men.
While there seems to be a ten¬
dency in some countries in Europe,
especially in Germany and in Italy,
for the women to return to the
home, the opposite is found in the


United States. There the tendency
among women is towards public life
or work outside of the home. Amer¬
ican women compete with men in
all lines of activity and not infre¬
quently dislodge men from their
jobs when they (the women) prove
to be more capable or useful. Many
women -are working at all sorts of
jobs because their husbands either
do not earn enough or are not
working at all.
The experience of Mrs. Ylagan
was that her interest in and apprecia¬
tion of a place, a building, a paint¬
ing, or a statue, was increased by
having as much information as she
could about it before viewing it.
Travel is both educational and en¬
joyable, but more so when one has
sufficient background in the way of
information. Mrs. Ylagan supple¬
mented her knowledge about the
places she intended to visit by read-
ing as many books and pamphlets
about them that she could get hold
of.

Miss Carmen F. Escano
RICH BUT HARD-WORKING
By RAFAEL A. BAUTISTA


YIVO Miss Carmen Fortich Esca¬
no, charming daughter of
Dr. and Mrs. Mamerto Esca¬
no of Cebu city, being rich is not
an excuse for being idle. For her,
work is noble and every man and
woman, poor and rich, should be
proud to engage in it:
Beautiful, petite Nenen, as she is
called by members of her family and
intimate friends, works hard like a
poor girl. As manager of the well¬
known firm, The Visayan Electrical
Supply Company, in Cebu City, she
is one of the few successful busi¬
ness women in the South to-day and
has, perhaps, the distinction of be¬
ing the youngest of them all.
Miss Escano is a rich girl, being
an heiress to the vast Escano for¬
tune in Cebu. As a daughter of a
wealthy family and being the pet
of her parents, Nenen can have any¬
thing that her parents’ money can


buy and lead a life of leisure if she
wishes, but instead she chooses to
work and earn her own living. It
is said that Miss Escano’s parents
objected to their daughter’s going
to work, foregoing further education
in a well-known finishing school and
travel in Europe that they had
p'anned for her after her high
school graduation from the Imma¬
culate Conception College in Cebu
several years ago, but Miss Escano
won out at the end.
She started as a mere salesgirl
in The Visayan Electrical Supply
Company. Soon after, she was pro¬
moted to the position of clerk, ther
to the position of manager that she
is occupying now. Her meteoric
rise was strictly based on merit.
Miss Escano has had no formal
business training, but she has ac¬
quired a practical knowledge of
business, from observation and ex¬
perience, which business students

of the Cebu Electrical Supply Company.


do not learn in the classrooms. She
showed an aptitude for business
even at an early age. The employees
under her speak highly of her busi¬
ness ability.
Work is not just a hobby with
Miss Escano, something to amuse
or to fill up the time between so¬
cial engagements, as it is with
many rich young women who also

Banqueting Appointees
It is not so bad, this popular cus¬
tom of banqueting newly-appointed
government officials. Only, as one
official said, he has already taken
out P50 from his salary, and still
there are some more expensive ban¬
quetings—for the same purpose-
in the offing.
As I said, chipping in for a ban¬
quet is not bad. It is good taste,
and a healthy sign of sincere friend-
ship. But the trouble is, they have
become so frequent the wife has
come to think it a big nuisance.
For such unlooked for expense,
the family has to make some slashes
in the budget, just to make it bal¬
ance. A father, most likely, has to
stop—for a while—buying candies
and sweetmeats for his children. Or
maybe deprive them of a new dress
or a needed pair of shoes.
But attending the banquets can’t
be he ped. Especially if the affair
is managed by one’s chief—how can
an underdog very well refuse to give
his share?

JAIME D. AGUILA and GE¬
RARDO V. AGUILA, P. O. BOx
104, Dumaguete, Oriental Negros,
wish to have pen-pals, especially
those from Luzon. These two
young men, both of the same age,
22, are cousins. They were born
and grew up in Luzon, but their
parents moved to Oriental Ne¬
gros last year and, expecting to
live there permanently, took
them along.
Jaime is fond of dancing and
reading love stories, while Gerar¬
do is fond of hiking and reading
essays. Both are not hard to look
at, but for the sake of fairness,
(according to Gerardo) Jaime is
more appealing to the sight than
Gerardo. Letters to both of them
may be written in English, Taga¬
log, or Bisaya. They will ask
their respective parents to deci¬
pher letters in Spanish sent to
them. They do not have any pic¬
tures of themselves at present
but will have some soon and will
send to those future correspond¬
ents who will ask for them. They
promise to answer all letters sent
to them promptly.,
ELIODORA BARRIOS of Le¬
gaspi, Albay, wishes to have pen¬
pals to cheer her up. She is five

in weight, and nineteen years of
age. She is a recent graduate o)
the Philippine Normal Schoot
und is at present teaching in the
public school in her home town.
Her hobbies are the movies and
reading stories. She promises to
exchange snapshots and to an¬
swer all letter sent to her.

at present, but she wants to have
more, men or women, here or
abroad. She is eighteen years old
and a high school graduate. Her
hobbies are writing, reading, go¬

THE COUNTRY

and it wouldn’t be time yet to go
home.
He was a good-looking boy, with
nice eyes, and Marion was willing
to like him a lot. Anyway she was
willing to like any fellow a lot who
would not try to get too much the
first time he met her. Not that
it mattered whether he tried to or
not—she could handle any of them
—but if they did not try for too
much the first time they met her,
then she would like them more the
second time, and maybe allow them
more.
She had no more idea of the coun¬
try than he had. To her it meant
a summer boarding house with
greasy papers, kids squealing, a
grape arbor in the rear of the
house you go to at night with fel-
lows. She had gone with Jimmy
because he had asked her, because
she was willing to like him, and
because she had nothing to do on
this particular Saturday afternoon.
Probably if he had said to her:
“Let’s take an airplane ride," or
"Let’s go and feed the animals in
the zoo," she would have answered:
“Sure. Let’s. Anything to pass
the time away."
So they were both very embar¬
rassed at the idea of the country.
And they wanted to reassure them-
selves. So he looked at her and
said:
“Isn’t this swell?”
And she answered:
“Yes, isn’t it?”
But they weren’t very sure.
The car was emptying. Around
them things looked like the coun¬
try. Trees. And grass. And a
big bunch of trees. Then a stream.
Country bungalows. They even saw
a cow. They looked at the cow and
said nothing.
It looked like time to get out. In
a movie you know which is the best
seat to sit in. If there is vaudeville,
you try to get front seats. If just
a picture, you sit in the middle. If
you’re with a girl and want to have
some fun you sit in the rear at the
side so the usher won’t see you.
But where is the best place to get
out in the country? Shall you get
off near a stream? Or where
there is a bunch of trees? Or where
there is grass? Jimmy did not
know. And Marion couldn’t help
him.
The car was now almost empty.
It was going along at a great speed
through the country; making a lot
of noise and lea " when it turned
a curve. Jimmy pulled the cord.
“Let’s get off,” he said.
The car stopped; the door swung
open; they got off, he holding the
cigar box; the door of the car shut.
The car banged and was off. They
were in the country.
“Well, come on," said Jimmy in
desperation.
She took his hand, and they
walked across the road, and went
on the grass, which felt funny un¬
der their feet, and went further
Then they saw some trees. So


they went toward the trees; and
beyond the trees, there were more
trees, and it looked quiet there, as
if there had never been anyone
there since the beginning of the
world. For the first time in their
lives each one of them felt com-
pletely alone. They might shout
and yell, and do as they pleased,
and no one would ever hear them,
and they were frightened
If Marion had been younger and
had not so far handled by herself
all sorts of dangerous situations,
she would have cried. And if Jim¬
my hadn’t been a man, hadn’t al¬
ways understood that a man never
shows emotion, never lets anyone
know how he is feeling, but wears
a hard, set face, Jimmy would have
cried too.
If there had but been anything
they knew around them. A house,
or an automobile, or even a ciga¬
rette butt lying on the ground; if
they had but seen anything they
were used to, they would have felt
easier. They would have been able
to dismiss this grass, these woods,
this sky, with a sneer. Sky? Go
on! Grass? Go on! But there
wasn’t. It was all sky and grass
and trees, and nothing else but
themselves. She in a very short
skirt and silk stockings, and he in
perforated oxfords and a blue suit.
It was getting very hot, and Jim¬
my’s collar was bothering him. He
wanted to take it off, but cou'dn’t.
He had a feeling something might
happen, what he did not know. Jim¬
my was feeling very formal and
very much out of place in this coun¬
try. And then they would have to
sit down finally, and how to sit
down the way they were dressed?
Jimmy began to swear under his
breath. Not very loudly, because he
was afraid of the country. It awed
him.
The ground had lowered under
their feet. Trees turned to bushes;
and finally they came to a stream.
There was a big rock near the
stream. It was cooler there, and
they couldn’t walk any further.
They decided to sit down. Jimmy
took a handkerchief out of his pock-
et, opened it, spread it carefully on
the rock, and sat down on it. Ma¬
rion stood. Her face had lost its
immobile expression and her mouth
was twitching. Then carelessly she
too sat down on the rock. Her face
contemptuously said: This is a fine
place you brought me to. What are
we going to do now that we’re
here?
They had nothing else to do.
so they ate. Really they did not
want to eat; the food felt hard and
dry in their mouths; they were
thirsty and there was nothing to
drink. Each one of them thought
of going back on the road and get-
ting a return car, and each one of
them was afraid to say it. They
had wanted to go to the country:
they were in the country; they
should be satisfied.
Around them birds were singing.
the stream ran down, a squirrel
came, looked at them, and ran off
It was cool where they were, cool


and nice, and as they went on eat¬
ing, slowly the realization came
that this dislike for the country
was something in their own heads,
that they really should not dislike
it. It was a pretty good place after
all. Only a place they knew noth-
ing about couldn’t be good, so they
didn’t want to admit to themselves


that they were beginning to like it.
It was Marion who really began
to like this country. At first she
sat on the rock; but the rock was
hard, and the ground looked soft;
so she slipped off on the grass, as
if unconsciously, as if against her
will, that Jimmy should not think

THE COUNTRY

she actually wanted to sit on the
grass. No, she didn’t. They had
come here expecting the same thing
they had in the city, and the thing
was different. And they could al¬
low nothing different, nothing that
they could not understand. So they
had to show that they disliked it,
that the city was a much better
place
But the country worked slowly.
At first it got only Marion. She
sat on the grass, her skirt carelessly
raised itself, one of her shoes
slipped off, and she did not put it
on again; then she took her hat
off: all as if she didn’t actua'ly
want to do it. Her face relaxed:
it was ne'ther hard nor soft; it was
an ordinary face. And she even ate
her sandwich with more appetite.
But the way the country really
got Jimmy was: He was thirsty
and he had an idea that the water
in the stream could be drunk. And
very much as if he were doing
something else, as if the water in
the stream were the last thing in
his mind, he walked down to the
edge, put his foot on a rock that
stood a little way off, formed his
hands into a cup, filled them with

water, and drank,
A few drops trickled down on his
pants, some more on his shoes. He
wanted to get angry, but he couldn’t.
He just looked at the glistening
drops on the blue cloth. and said
nothing. Then he called her:
“Come on down and get a drink."
She did. Out of his hands. More
water spilled over their clothes.
They made believe they did not no¬
tice it.
The country was getting them
more and more. They were still sil¬
ent. Anyone looking at them would
think they were very uncomfortable,
very much out of place. But they
were beginning to like it here. In
themselves they stopped fighting
this country around them and be¬
gan to accept it.
So that finally when Marion took
off her other shoe and her stock¬
ings and went wading, Jimmy
thought nothing of it. It seemed
perfectly natural. And when Jimmy
began to throw pebbles into the wa¬
ter near her, she shrieked, but not
angri'y. She enjoyed the waten
wetting her dress.
Jimmy took off his coat and col¬
lar and tie, rolled up his sleeves and
tried to prevent Marion from get¬
ting out of the water. So she
splashed him and got him wet too;
and they both laughed.
Then she said: “Look at the
flowers," and went barefooted to
pick them. Jimmy lay down on the
grass near the rock, belly down, face
cupped in his hands. He saw bugs
and ants carrying splinters. Then
he discovered an ant hi'l. Lots of
little holes in a mound of sand, with
ants, running in and out, appearing
and disappearing.
It was quiet here. The stream
below, the birds singing, the grass¬
hopper that cracked occasionally.
only made the place quieter. This
clearing with the rock in the cen¬
ter of it seemed the whole world.
Nothing beyond existed. The city
not far away did not exist. Jimmy
had the feeling that he was away
a'one, at peace.
Marion came near, her arms full
of flowers, walking uncomfortably
on her bare feet. She sat down at
his side and began weaving a crown.
She did not look at him, but seemed
very serious, very intent with what
she was doing, braiding one flower
into another, until three together
came out.
For a time he felt content. Even
Marion coming near him made him
think of nothing. For a time there
was nothing in him. In a way there
were things, for he felt something
going through him, something very
warm and very quiet, something he
had never felt before; as if a mild
electric shock went through him
with a pleasant sensation. He
wanted to shake it off, he wanted
to sit up. Things like that shoulo
not happen to him, nothing he could
not explain should ever happen to
him. But in a way he was toc
sleepy, too content to sit up; so he
gave himself up to the shock, that
combined with the sound of the
stream, with the singing of birds,
with smell of the grass, of the

Marion sat at his side, busy plait
ing f'owers, thinking of nothing,
feeling nothing. It was as if sho
belonged to this country, to this
peace.
Then Jimmy began to think. He
began to consider what they were
doing, what position they were in.
Still reposed, still relaxed, he be¬
gan to wonder what would happen
if someone should ask him what
they had done on this Saturday
afternoon. If he should want to
answer, what could he say? “Well,

first we were scared. And then we
kind of liked it. .,o I lay down on
the grass and was satisfied, and
Marion made a crown of flowers.
Well, if he should say it? He pic-
tured to himself one of his friends
to whom he should say a thing like
that. What would the other’s an-
swer? Why, he would burst out
laughing. “That’s a fine way to
spend a Saturday afternoon! Go to

acknowledge a thing like that, he
would never hear the end of it.

QUESTIONS: —What are the
causes of sleeping sickness? What
are its symptoms? How many types
of sleeping sickness are there?—
Federico M. Limsiaco, Himamaylan,
Oce. Negros.
ANSWERS:—Sleeping sickness
is caused by a blood parasite, the
Trypanosoma gambiense, which is
conveyed by two varieties of the
tsetse fly, Glossima palpalis and
Glossima morsitans. The symptoms
in the early stage are irregular
fever, irritability, headache, sleep¬
lessness, and loss of strength. The
eye ids become puffy; an erythema¬
tous eruption appears on the skin.
After a variable period of apparent
improvement the victim becomes
more and more lethargic, is aroused
with difficulty, takes little food,
and becomes emaciated. The anae¬
mia is more pronounced, tremors of
the hand and tongue are noted,
and areas of anaesthesia and hy¬
peraseathesia are seen in some pa¬
tients. In the final stage the tre-
mors become convulsions, apathy
and somnolence merge into torpor
and coma. Death takes place in
coma or from some intercurrent
disease such as pneumonia or dy¬
sentery. The duration of sleening
sickness is variable. The first
stage may last from a few months
to a few years, and life may be
prolonged by careful nursing and
medication.—From “The New In¬
ternational Encyclopaedia."
QUESTIONS: — What causes
mumps? What is the best treat-
ment for it?—A   reader,
Manila.
ANSWERS:—Mumps usually be¬
gins with a feeling of stiffness
about the jaws, which is fo'lowed
by pains, heat, and swelling be¬


and closing your eyes!
He opened his eyes and sat up.
The smell of the grass disap-
peared, and the scene around him
began to look a little foreign, as if
he had only thought he was at
home here, but he really wasn’t.
And even if he was, he shouldn’t
have been. A man has no right to
lie on the grass and smell flowers,
or watch an ant hill with a million
ants. Again in a way he became
uncomfortable, did not know what
to do with the things around him.
Actually he should not have begun
to feel so, because actually he liked
it here, and wanted to stay here,
but it was his head that began
working, that began to feel uncom-
fortable.
He looked at Marion. At first
she did not notice his look, but
went on plaiting her long crown,
but then she did notice him, and
turned toward him, smiled, and


neath the ear. The salivary glands
may become involved, so that the
swelling extends along the neck to¬
wards the chin. One or both sides
may be affected, and, in general,
the disease appears first on one
side and then on the other. There
is seldom much fever. The infla¬
mation is usually at its highest
point in three or four days, after
which it begins to decline, suppu¬
ration of the glands scarcely ever
occurring. In most cases no treat¬
ment further than due attention to
the bowels and protection of the
parts from cold by the app’ication
of flannel or of cotton is required,
and the patient completely recov¬
ers in eight or ten days.—From
“The New International Encyclo¬
paedia."


then looked back to her flowers.
Even Marion, even Marion must
think he was an awful fool to take
a girl out to a God-forsaken spot
and do nothing to make her enjoy
herself. Now if they had gone to
an amusement park, where there
is noise, and dancing, and attrac¬
tions, she would have had a good
time, but as it was, how could she:
He was very angry at himself.
He did not want to be, he did not
want to think, to consider himself
and this girl toward him. He
wanted to stretch out again on the
grass, close his eyes and give him¬
self up to the warm, funny feeling.
He wanted to, but he couldn’t. In
his mind he saw his friends grin¬
ning, laughing at him. “You’re a
fast worker, aren’t you? Take a
girl out and make her weave
crowns!” He saw himself on the
rear seat of a dark automobile, with
a girl at his side. Action! Or in
a hallway after an evening at the
movies, with the girl in a way anx¬
ious to go home—Father will be
awfully mad. Look at the time¬


but really not anxious at all. Ac¬
tion! Action!
He looked again at Marion, mea¬
sured through her with his eyes.
And then saying to himself: I don’t
want to do it. I don’t know why.
but I don’t feel that way now; he
leaned toward her, put his arm
around her, and tried to kiss her.
"Don’t," she said, pushing him
aside.
He was glad she said Don’t. In
a way it seemed funny that there
should be times when you don’t
want to kiss a girl, when you o
want to notice her, when you
with yourself, satisfied with y
self. The feeling had never C
to him before, and at first he
himself up to it, and again me.
ly closed his eyes. and then s
more thoughts shot through
Again he saw the hallway, W
a girl says Don’t, it doesn’t m
anything. It means she’s bash
or coy, or she just wants you
want her more. Something in
said: Why must you act now

Advice To A Teacher Just Embarked
Upon His Profession
By EULALIO B. ALFONSO
Academic Supervisor, Cagayan


w presume that you will event-
ually join the teaching profes¬
 sion. I say “eventually,” be¬
cause as you are very well aware,
your graduation from a normal
course does not carry a guarantee
of appointment to a teaching posi¬
tion. It would seem unkind and
out of place to bring up this sub¬
ject when you are "a raring," so to
speak, "to go forth and conquer the
world.” It would appear as a dash
of cold water on your enthusiasm
to do so, but facts are facts, and
sooner or later you must face them.
It is not my purpose, however, to
talk on the problems of securing a
position. That there now exists a
very keen competition in securing
teaching positions, you are well
aware. That quite a number of
graduates from the normal course
in previous years have failed to be¬
come teachers, have given up all
hope of becoming one altogether,
have secured certificates from
priests and ministers and have en¬
gaged in bringing up children of
their own, you doubtless know.
Many are they who are content with
securing appointments for substi¬
tute positions. But I do not advise
you to aspire for this kind of ap-
pointment. Do not be a substitute
nor seek to be one, if you can pos¬
sibly help it. If you cannot land a
regular teaching position for which
you prepared yourself, you should
remember that there are other
lines of endeavor which, with the
help of the liberal education you
have acquired, should prove as lu¬
crative as teaching—minus, of
course, the opportunity of putting
into practice such lofty ideals of
service and of self-sacrifice as
have prompted you to choose teach-

ing as your life profession. The
farm, the business field, home in¬
dustries, and other fields of human
endeavor, should offer opportuni¬
ties for material advancement for
an ambitious young man or woman
of ordinary native ability and
equipped with an education such as
you now possess. While it is true
that you prepared yourself for
teaching, it is absurd to believe
that you should become helpless
and flounder like a fish out of the
water if you fail to secure a teach-
ing position.
I have started to say that I am
going to talk to you as one teach¬
er to another. To begin with, I
should like to ask you not to feel
disappointed if such remarks as
am now about to make are not sup¬
ported by opinions and scientific
findings of eminent authorities on
educational thoughts. Rather, let
me ask you to bear with me if I
make use of the only reference at
my command: an experience of
over twenty-three years in actual
contact with school administrators,
teachers, pupils, and parents in all
walks of life and circumstances.
Your first opportunity may
come suddenly, and only subsequent
events in your career will prove
its importance or otherwise. I re¬
fer to your choice of an assignment
in case you are offered one. I trust
that I am not giving away inside
information if I told you that an
offer of a position is often only a
matter of form. It is either take
it or leave it. It calls for quick, in¬
stinctive decision, which is often
decisive. A young teacher’s future
may forever be ruined by a show of
reluctance te accept an offer of
assignment which involves some
risk, inconvenience, discomfort or
prospect of big problems ahead.
Here is an opportunity for the
young teacher to put to a test his
vaunted ability to take care of
himself, of his self-reliance, and
of his confidence to overcome dif-
ficulties. Of course, we realize
the traditional attachment between
young people and their kins, there¬
by preferring an assignment in the
old home town or barrio. Respect¬
ing this traditional attachment to
the old home town, let me cite to
you an old proverb among our peo¬
ple, founded on a fact, which is, in
effect, like this: "A banana suckel
does not develop, as on the contra¬
ry it degenerates both in size and
in quality, if it is allowed to ma¬
ture and bear in the same clump
with its parent plant.” Literally.


MEMBERS OF SCHOOL FACULTY


Members of the faculty of the Pangasinan Secondary School at
Lingayen, Pangasinan.


it means that the succeeding gener-
ations of banana shoots degenerate
with the years if the suckers are
not transplanted away from the ori¬
ginal clump. The same is true, I be¬
lieve, with the ratoon of the sugar
cane. While it is true that you are
neither banana sucker nor ratoon
the analogy in giving preference to
an assignment in the old home
town among one’s kins, to a re¬
mote place, seems to hold good just
the same, and the reasons are ma¬
ny and obvious, foremost among
which is the lack of opportunity
for rapid all-round development.
Again, there is that preference
to an assignment in a central
school to one in a barrio. Central
schools are generally run by capable
principals upon whose guidance
young teachers almost entirely de¬
pend. From him and the supervis¬
ing teacher, the young teacher re¬
ceives innumerable suggestions cal¬
culated to make him grow. Wheth-
er these suggestions really help the
teacher to grow professionally, or
whether they only tend to confound
him, depends, of course, upon the
teacher’s own reactions. In the
central school, teachers do not, gen¬
erally, rake their brains to solve
serious problems in discipline or de¬
linquency, problems of equipment,
the planning of ground improve¬
ments or the construction and re¬
pair of fences and buildings. They
leave these matters for the princi¬
pal or the supervising teacher to
worry about. As a matter of fact,
these school officials vie with
each other in doing everything for
the teacher. They even think for
him; they plan his lessons for him;
they teach and demonstrate for
him; and solve his petty problems
for him. It is small wender, there¬
fore, that the poor young central
school teacher has no opportunity
for self-development, for growth.
He is too much in the shade, in


the shadow of the principal. While
it cannot be denied that a central
school assignment has its distinct
advantages in the form of comfort,
closer supervision, better equipment,
and lesser problems respecting dis¬
cipline, attendance, finance, and
the like, an assignment in a barrio
school, especially if it is a one¬
teacher school, offers better oppor-
tunities for rapid, all-round devel¬
opment. You should realize that a
head teacher in a barrio school or
a teacher in a one-teacher school,
is to the school and the community
as the central principal is to the
central school plant and to the peo¬
ple in the town.

this month in which Miss Leonedisa
Tan, a junior in the high school,
was proclaimed “Miss Visayan In¬
stitute of 1936,” the Freshman

connection with the celebration.
The fiesta was formally opened with
a long torch parade around the

as he used to do before, when he
arrives home from the office. The
other members of the family have
stopped petting me.
Even the girls next door have
stopped playing with me. They act
with some restraint and wear a
serious air in my presence. It was
not long ago that I was their play¬
mate and we joked easily with-each
other. I, too, have become self-con¬
scious in their presence. I did not
know what had happened to change
our lives so. All these changes
puzzled me. But understanding
came upon me one day when I least
expected it.
I was bound for school dressed
in a sartorial elegance that wou'd
have captured a feminine heart. In
five minutes the school bell would
ring, and I still had one mile to go.


Fearing to be late, I redoubled my
steps and unwittingly col.ided with
somebody.
"Aray, Mama!” exclaimed a femi¬
nine voice.
I turned my head to see who she
was. I realized I had stepped on
her toes.
“Excuse me, Ale,” I begged her
pardon.
I thought of the incident in class.
Why did that woman call me Mama?
Do I look old enough to be addressed
thus? I looked at myse.f in my
pocket mirror and reasoned in¬
wardly. Maybe.: After dismissal, I
went home in great haste. I was
eager to relate the story to my
mother. But upon entering our
house, I bumped my head against
the top of our porch door and I was
thrown violently to the ground. I
smiled. I understood.
“I am a man!" I muttered softly
to myself.

the highbrows would name
Ait, but the rest prefer to
call it by its inelegant but more pop¬


ular name, Ipil, and you have to let
it go at that.
Quite a small street, Ipil
is,
which branches out on one side in¬


President Quezon with officers of the Student Commonwealth Gov-
ernment of the Rizal Memorial Academy, who paid their respects to
him in his office at Malacanang last month. The president of this
organization is Rafael de Pena, seen at the right of President Quezon.


to some two or three other narrow
streets. The Ipil people have had
plenty of what others gamely term
“Life’s hard knocks,” that is why
they are so closely knit together
by a wonderful spirit of unity. You
do not have to command here; you
have only to ask and everybody co¬
operates. Take for instance their
ronda system.
About two months ago, a big fire
razed down a few large houses in
Bambang, Santa Cruz. The very
first to witness the disaster were
the Ipil citizens—somewhat scared,
you may be sure, as they live rath-
er near the scene of the blaze. In
the excitement that followed, a
sleeping baby was left alone in a
house just where Alvarez and Mag¬
dalena streets intersect. Above the
child was a gas lamp, dangling from
the ceiling. Somehow or other, the
support snapped, and gas, lamp,
and all dropped to the floor. In a
moment the whole place was burn¬
ing too. Three men, who hap-
pened to be near-by, rescued the
baby and put out the fire before it
could do any further damage. In¬
cidentally, the child died from the
effects of the blaze.
That tragic occurrence gave the
Ipil people plenty to think about.
One can never tell just when a fire
might start, you know, and the
homes on Ipil street are pretty
close together and built of com-
bustible materials. Therefore, a
group of active men banded to¬
gether and agreed to revive the
ronda system (bantay sunog to
those who are not in the know),
which had died out with the pas¬
sing of days.
For this purpose, a wooden shed
erected on a space directly over¬
looking the majority of the houses
on the street, was made the


“headquarters.” Each house own¬
er has been asked to send at least
one able-bodied man to act as ban¬
tay sunog on a certain night of the
week. The "guard" walks up and
down the street the whole evening,
on the lookout for fire, thieves, and
other prowlers. At the first sight
of danger, he rings the rather large
bell in front of the “headquarters.
Several peals following each other
in quick succession means a grave
menace indeed.
The shed is equipped with a
number of red pails, a few benches,
ladders, and a blackboard whereon
are written the names of those who
are to do the vigil that day.
No fire has fortunately broken
out yet since the ronda was re¬
vived, although two thieves who
had tried to take advantage of the

compactness of the houses by hid-
ing under them, were successfully
delivered to the proper authorities
by the Ipil bantay sunog.
To keep the interest of the peo¬
ple in the ronda system forever
alive, speeches are delivered on
special occasions. Ipil citizens love
speeches, so the speakers always
have an enthusiastic audience. The
topics discussed deal mainly on the
value of civic spirit, dangers of
fire, the consequences of a mo¬
ment’s carelessness, and similar
other subjects. Prominent men
are sometimes invited to speak be¬
fore the ronda men. Mr. T. F. Me¬
Intyre (captain of Santa Cruz fire
station) was one of the very first
speakers. He also taught his hear¬
ers how to operate an alarm box.
Politicians, too, use the ronda head¬
quarters for delivering speeches,
no, not for fire prevention purposes,
but for campaigning. But that is
neither here nor there.
The ronda is still going strong
and promises to last this time. Were
it not for the scare the Ipil people
received from the fire described
somewhere before, perhaps the
ronda or the bantay sunog would
never have been revived. But the
simple “Ipil-ians” have had their
lesson and have emerged from it
sadder but very much wiser. Di¬
saster warned them for a time, but
it has induced them later on into
doing a worthy act—the prevention
of the spread of fires.
Ipil is a small street, yes, but it
has gone one step farther than ma¬
ny of the other streets which may
be more conspicuous.

you act in a hallway? And some¬
thing answered: I can’t act in any
other way. I don’t know how. She
was here with him. She had to be
kissed. There was no getting away
from that. You don’t go out with
a girl unless you are going to kiss
her.
So he did the same thing. Again
he did not want to do it, was
ashamed of himself because he did
not want to do it, and forced him¬
self. He rose a little, and hugged
Marion tightly, and he forced a
kiss on her. Then when he had fin¬
ished, he leaned back and looked
at her. And she was very angry.
She said in a loud, slightly
squeaky voice:
“Cut it out. Haven’t you got
any sense?”
She seemed irritated, as if she
didn’t understand why he should
want to do a thing like that. Her
face looked different from the fa¬
ces of other girls he had tried to
kiss. When they had said: Don’t,
stop; they had giggled, they had
averted their eyes. They had want-
ed to show in some way they did
not want him to stop. But Marion
didn’t. She looked straight at him
when she said that, with an angry
look, in a way saying: What do you
want to do that for? Why do it
here? This is not the place. This
is not the time.
And he did understand that look
of hers, he did know that he should
stop now: that not only did he not
want to kiss her, to bring her close
to him now, but that she did not
want him to do it either. He
should go back to his grass, keep on
smelling it, close his eyes. Back.
But he didn’t. Something drove
him to it. Something forced him
to keep on trying to kiss her. In a
way he was desperate. He did not
want to do it. This was not the
place for it. But he couldn’t do
anything else. He simply couldn’t.
He had to kiss her now, although
it brought him no pleasure, al¬
though he knew he was annoying
her.
So he sat right down at her side;
he brushed the crown she had been
braiding so carefully aside, and he
tried to force her to kiss him. He
held her very tight, and with one
arm held her head up, clasped the
other round her shoulders and
pressed his lips against her mouth.
It was a hard kiss he gave her, hard
and dry and distasteful like the
food they had eaten when they had
first come.
And although she struggled with
him, and said: No. Go away.
don't want to. Let me alone, I tell
you. Go away; still he kept on.
And he was very sad. While strug¬
gling with her, while trying to
force her, he felt as if he had lost
something, something he had, that
meant much to him.
The country disappeared. All
that was around them was a bunch
of trees, and a stream, and grass
that was good to kiss a girl on.
And right near them was a city,

WONDERS OF THE PHILIPPINES- B, Recie


The Manila Carnival
Y STABLISHED to become a "na¬
4 tional festival for entertainment,"
B the Manila Carnival has become
not only a permanent "national amuse¬
ment institution" but also a factor,
growing in importance each year, in
the commercial, industrial, and agricul¬
tural development of the country. Fun
and frolic which were the fundamen¬
tal objects of the early Carnivals are
now gradually being subordinated to
the utilitarian phase. However, the
old gaiety although in a lesser degree,
remains to make the Carnival unusual¬
ly entertaining.
The history of this "miracle city”


dates back to 1908. During those days,
Manila was a quiet town, devoid of
the many recreations which present
city residents enjoy. Captain George T.
Langhorne, member of the then Gov-
ernor-General Forbes’ famous "polo ca¬
binet," conccived the idea of breaking
the monotonous routine of city life
with a week or so of festivity a year.
Governor Forbes thought the idea was
good, and Captain Langhorne at a con¬
ference of representative business men,
army officers, and government officials,
was named director-general of what
was to be a nine-day festival. The 1908
Carnival was held on the historic Wal¬
lace Field, a natural garden spot of
more than 40 acres, which has proved


to be an ideal location for this institu¬
tion. The month selected was Feb¬
ruary, the month when the climate of
the Islands is at its best.
Some of the principal attractions
that the annual Manila Carnival pre¬
sents are the National Beauty Contest
for the selection of the Carnival Queen
and Miss Philippines, the Commercial
and Industrial Fair, the National Agri¬
cultural and Commercial Exposition
(which is only on its third year but
has already gained unusual impor-
tance), the United States Army exhi¬
bits and shows, the side shows, the
provincial and government booths, and
the parades.


dark automobiles, dark movies, dark
parlors.
Then he saw it was of no use. The
kissing brought him nothing. He
did not enjoy it and neither did she.
Her dress got crumpled, her hair
disarranged, and on the grass
around them lay the torn flowers.
She shook him off and said:
"I’m going back."
She put her hat on and adjusted
her shoes. He also got himself
ready. He looked again at the
dead, ugly unfamiliar country.
Then together they walked to the
car.

end later of the legislature, from
1910 to 1925. He was president
pro tempore of the senate twice,
first when President Quezon went
to the United States and again
when the latter fell ill. His term
expiring in 1929, he was immediate¬
ly appointed judge of the court of
first instance. The province of Ta¬
yabas was his first assignment.
Prior to the National Assembly
elections last year, he had been ru¬
mored as the logical successor of
Speaker Paredes. When he resign¬
ed as judge last year and became
elected as assemblyman for Leyte,
the rumors continued. As a matter
of fact, with Assemblyman Roxas
Ceclaring he would not run for the
speakership and Speaker Paredes
safely tucked away as resident com¬
niissioner to Washington, Mr. Ena¬
ge was nominated Speaker during
a caucus meeting at President
Quezon’s house.
But the Leyte assemblyman re¬
fused the offer. The job of speak¬
er, he pointed out, is, under the


Constitution, simply that of a mere
presiding officer. The job, in ef¬
fect, is without the powers it for¬
merly carried, he added.
Last December, however, on the
assumption of many that he would
be appointed chairman of the pro¬
posed Court of Appeals, Judge Ena¬
ge resigned as member of the Na¬
tional Assembly. But, suddenly,
public opinion rose against him.
The Constitution, it was said, pro¬
hibits any member of the Assembly
from being appointed to any office
created by the Assembly at the
time he was a member of that body.
President Quezon, as it stood,
was bent on appointing Judge
Enage to the Court of Appeals. He
said the latter’s appointment would
not be, by any interpretation of the
Constitution, unconstitutional. Well¬
known constitutional lawyers, in
the government service, had the
same opinion as the President’s.
But Judge Enage, his self-respect
higher than his ambition, surprised
everyone. He publicly refused any
post in the newly created Court of
Appeals.
Judge Enage, nevertheless, upon
a third offer, had to accept the po¬
sition of Malacanang adviser—
else he would have hurt the Presi¬
dent’s feelings.

periods prescribed in them for the
presentation of pleadings are those
which have been found by exper¬
ience to be convenient to the par¬
ties and the courts. If there are
attendant delays, they may be as¬
cribed to other causes, not to cum-
bersome procedural rules.
Our Flexible Rules of Court
Another far-reaching stride for-
ward has recently been taken in
this jurisdiction. Reference is made
to the provision in the new Philip-
pine Constitution which vests the
control of procedure in the Supreme
Court instead of in the legislature.
This is Article VIII, section 13, of
the Constitution. It reads:
“SEC. 13. The Supreme Court
shall have the power to pronul¬
gate rules concerning pleading,
practice and procedune in all
courts, and the admission to the
practice of law. Said rules shall
be uniform for all courts of the
same grade and shall not dimin¬
ish, increase, or modify substan¬
tive rights. The existing laws on
pleading, prectice, and procedure
are hereby repealed as statutes.
and are declared Rules of Courts.
subject to the power of the
Supreme Court to alter and mo¬
dify the same. The National As¬
sembly shall have the power to
repeal, alter, or supplement the
rules concerning pleading, prac¬
tice, and procedure, end the ad¬
mission to the practice of law in
the Philippines."
This provision makes our rules of
procedure most flexib'e. The Sup-
reme Court may further simplify
it any time, by amendment. No
longer is legislation necessary, al¬
though of course, the Assembly
may modify the rules, which is not
likely, because the Supreme Court
is undoubtedly the best qua'ified to
pass upon the necessity and feasibil¬
ity of any proposed change.
There Will Always Be Delays
But even with all this flexibility
in our procedural rules, there will

NO COMPULSORY MILITARY
Continued from paga s


Another Datu's Opinion
I shifted my steps towards the
house of another datu, the muni¬
cipal president of a town border¬
ing Lake Lanao.
We talked of the weather, the
life around the lake, the people’s
trades. The Moros are satisfied
with their government, he said. I
pleased him when I said his follow¬
ers are faithful to him and to the
Koran. Then I brought my subject


out.
“The Moros, in general,” he told
me, "are against mi-itary training.”
"Why?”
Not Permitted by Traditions
“Moro traditions do not permit
it,” he said at length. “Our splen¬
did history, our glorious past did
not say that our forefathers had
been ordered by their tribal govern¬
ment to practise military tactics in
preparation either for war or for
defense.


“Our Koran, which we respect as
much as you do your Holy Bible,
does not say anything about milit
ary training. When our forefathers
fought their wars, they simply
banded together, carried their kam¬
pilans and barongs, and annihilated
their enemies. It will be a sad
thing, therefore, to teach Moros the
arts of offense and defense. It will
be against traditions, customs, and
religion."
Suicide to Force Moros
“The government is always sup¬
reme to a tribe,” I exp’ained to him.
“The tribe owes allegiance to the
government, and the tribesmen, by
implication, are sworn to obey and
perform its commands. It can force
you to take up military training."
“That, I suppose, is true—to your
way of thinking,” he answered
after several moments of deep
thought. “But, just now, we are in
need of unity—national unity! We
need to be formed solidly so we can
solve our national problems.
“But, if the government compels
the Moros to undergo compulsory
mi'itary training, it will be only
committing suicide. Of course, the
Moros can be forced, the govern¬
ment can go that far. But, as soon
as we have our guns, we will run
and hide in the mountain fastnes¬
ses. We could then resist the gov¬
ernment, and kill its agents, with
its very weapons.
Continuing: “If the government
wants everybody to be well versed
in military tactics, we can simply
be given guns and bullets so that
we can practice in our homes with-
out the least disturbance to our
family ca’lings. This does not
mean a refusal to rally to our na¬
tional colors when war arises. We
are simp'y against military train¬
ing."
Educated Moros Differ
Moros who have had a taste of
education in the public schools,
however, give an opposite opinion.
They are heartily for the National
Defense Act. They are more than
willing to serve a period of milit¬
ary apprenticeship in the training
camps. But these young people,
mostly high school boys, do not
count at all. They are too few to
offset the current Moro opinion.
What will happen when regis¬
tration for the training camps

P5.00 on Gandara street in Manila.
A P13.50 recovery suit, heard in
the sala of Judge Abeto, dragged
for about a year, and required the
costly services of an American law¬
yer. Maria Chan sent several
dresses, among them a silk one, to
Pedro Indiongco’s dry-cleaning es¬
tablishment for washing. The
dresses washed, the si'k one was
found torn. Forthwith Maria Chan
returned it for mending. But the
dress disappeared and Indiongco,
feigning innocence, refused to pay
the price of the dress.
Faced Attachment Suit
The Manila municipal court or¬
dered the defendant Indiongco to
pay P13.50, the cost of the silk dress.
But the fellow instead of paying the
amount appealed the case to the
court of first instance. Well, he
spent some more for the litigation,
so did the plaintiff, and when the
case was decided (against the de-
fendant again), Indiongco found
himse'f facing an attachment suit
on his establishment because he
could not pay the litigation expenses
and attorney’s fees which had
mounted high.
And then there was that suit
over a lot costing only P44.00. It
reached the Supreme Court. In
that case, plaintiff Catalino Galle¬
mit and defendant Ceferino Tabili¬
ran acquired a lot under a verbal,
civil contract of partnership. The
land cost. P44.00. Each contributed
P22 for the purchase of the land.
But when plaintiff Catalino re¬
quested for a partition of the land,
defendant Tabiliran refused to di¬
vide it. He said he was the sole
owner of the lot.
It was a legal wrangle all right,
and from Dapitan, Zamboanga.
where the suit started, the messy
litigation was brought to Manila
for the Supreme Court to decide.
That was plain recklessness on the
defendant’s part. For the printing
of the brief alone he had already
to spend P75.00. You can guess
at the amount he paid for printing
his bill of exceptions and for law¬
yer’s fees. And what’s worse, he
lost his case (Gallemit vs. Tabili¬
ran, 20 Phil. 241.)

TENNIS
Juanito Gavia, younger brother
of the national and all-comers
champion, disposed of Felix Am¬
pon, former national tennis titlist,
in 3 straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3, the
other Sunday afternoon at the Ri¬
zal Memorial Tennis Stadium. The
same afternoon Gene Smith of the
U. S. downed W. K. Royales, 7-5,
6-2, 6-2.
* *
Gene Smith and Wayne Sabin,
visiting tennis aces from the U.
S., bested Mauricio Zamora and
Guillermo Aragon in one of the
two quarterfinals of the men’s dou¬
bles the other Tuesday at the Rizal
Memorial Stadium. The match, one
of the longest and most closely con¬
tested during the season, ended
with the scores of 7-5, 3-6, 6-3,
16-18, and 6-2. In the other quar¬
terfinal match, Dave Thompson
and A. H. Hasset of Australia dis¬
posed of Mariano Servillon and
Rodrigo Diaz in three straight sets,
6-2, 6-3, 6-3.
* * *
The Ochoa sisters, Minda and
Aida, shoved Mrs. William Dimi¬
trijevic and Miss Irmgard Bau¬
mann off their throne as all-comers
women doubles champs last Thurs¬
day at the Rizal Memorial Stadium
to the tune of 7-5, 6-4.
* * *
Leonardo Gavia, national and
all-comers title-holder, had his
sweet revenge last Thursday when
he trounced V. T. Wong of China
in the semifinal match in the up-
per bracket at the Rizal Memorial
Stadium. Wong, the metropolitan
tennis champ, earned his crown by
defeating Gavia here last Decem¬
ber. The match which went the
full five sets ended with the scores
of 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, 1-6, and 6-4.
Gavia’s victory ushered him into
the all-comers’ finals.
* * *
Juanito Gavia was eliminated by
Gene Smith in the semi-finals
(6-4, 7-5, 6-4) last Friday after¬
noon, the American thus earning
the right to fight Leonardo Gavia,
defending champ, in the finals.
Young Gavia was not equal to the


fine net play and good service of
the six-foot American.

tennis champion last Friday after¬


Minda Ochoa: captures third tennis title.


noon, when she bested Defending
Champion Mrs. H. Dimitrijevic to
the tune of 6-0, 7-9, 6-1. The
youthful queen of the courts is al¬
so the present national and metro¬
politan champion. She played a
dazzling game, displaying a variety
of strokes which baffled the older
tennis ace.


BASEBALL
The visiting Hawaiian All Stars
blanked the Manila Bay League All
Stars at the Jose Rizal Baseball
Stadium last Thursday afternoon,
at the same time managing to gar¬
ner three runs. Hulking Hank
Graham of the visiting team blasted
a homerun in the third inning.
This was the fifth victory of the
visitors out of the 6 games they
played. In their opening game they
easily swamped the Sto. Tomas
nine, 8-1, in a 14-inning game.
They dropped their second encoun¬
ter against Calamba, but won suc¬
cessively over the Bay League Se¬
lection, the All Navy, and the Sto.
Tomas contingents in the following
engagements.
SWIMMING
The bureau of education tankers
captured the national swimming


championship last Friday after¬
noon, piling 27 points against 25
of the U. S. T., the nearest rival.
Teofilo Ildefonso placed only third
in his favorite event, the 200-meter
breaststroke, Arasad of the U. P
being in the lead and Jikirum trail¬
ing. The time was 2 minutes, 54.5
seconds. (Ildefonso’s Philippine and
Far Eastern record in this event is
minutes, 42.6 seconds.) The Phil-
ippine Women’s University also
swam away with the women’s
championship by garnering 46
points.


BASKETBALL
A last spurt in the last quarter
pushed the YCO All-Star cagers to
a two-point victory over the Ate¬
neo dribblers, 35-37, last Friday at
the Ateneo gymnasium. After be¬
ing held back in the first three
quarters of the game, the YCO con¬
tingent broke through the defen¬
ses of the Ateneo five, the last and
winning shot being made by Marti¬
nez.


GOLF
Larry Montes, the former caddy
who became Philippine open golf
champion, made a successful come¬


back the other Sunday, when he
again copped the title by defeating
Defending Champion Guillermo
Navaja on the Wack Wack Golf
and Country Club course. The
matches which started last Februa¬
ry 14th netted Montes the score of
303 against Navaja’s 308. Sam
Bates, Jr., of Cavite, tied with Na¬
vaja for the second place. Montes
was Philippine open golf champ in
1929, 1931, and 1932; was national
professional title-holder in 1933
and 1934.

back if Carling consented to marry
me. So hopefully I came here to
Balasan where Carling resides. But
I met only disappointment.
In Balasan she lived with a kind
family and took up sewing for a
living. The house of the family was
destroyed and the couple took the
girl to Simeon Ganzon, an ex-presi¬
dent, and requested him to accom¬
modate her in his house while the
destroyed house was being re¬
paired.
Mr. and Mrs. Ganzon took Con¬
cordia to live with them, and she
was treated like one of the family.
The girl returned their kindness by
being a good and useful companion.
Visits Her Again
One time the couple went to Ilo-
ilo and Concordia was left with
their daughter who was in school
When they returned, they learnec
that in their absence Carlos visited
Concordia every evening. Much as
they loved Concordia, the couple
did not want to be involved in a
scandal. So Concordia went to live
with another family in Barrio Ca¬
mambugan of the same town.
There were days when Concordia
was forced to go without food be¬
cause what she earned by sewing
was not sufficient. Carlos again
visited her in the evenings. Con¬
cordia still hoped that some day
Carlos would pity and marry her.
But several times the flame of
her hope flickered. It is related
that one time Concordia met Car¬
los in the market premises. Carlos
took her to a group of young men
and addressed one of his friends:
“Do you want her? You can have
her. I’ve had enough of her."
Concordia said nothing; only
bowed her head in shame. Similar
insults took place later but she kept
on hoping. And then came that
fatal night when, she said, she
could bear it no longer.

There was a hush as Filo joined
in. This was the first time he
would tease her since that time long
before. But Rita was already flush¬
ing. Like an anaemic rose eager¬
ly drinking stray droplets of rain.
And Leon looked dumbly on—
Almost everyone was out at noon
Filo dropped himself into a chair,
blew imperfect smoke-rings, looked
at me. His were the manners of a
rooster about to crow.
“She promised me the second
dance of the evening. The first
will be with the consort and the se¬
cond will be mine. I certainly can
hold my janes!”
So that was it. Then I remem¬
bered something.
"Well, Leon is the consort. So
you get the dance after him.
“Wrong. He isn’t. The sap said
he'd rather be a slave for life than
king for a night. He would, the
sap!
I was beginning to wish Filo were


not the timekeeper. I could have
called him so many things. Dog in
the manger....! But he happened
to be the timekeeper and Leon was
just a dumbell from the same bar¬
rio I came from.
The morning after the corona¬
tion.
Rita’s usually dead-white face
glowed under the optimistic appli¬
cation of rouge. Also, there was
the memory of the many who had
clamored for dances the night be¬
fore. Night-lights can be so il¬
lusory. Rita glowed.
And Leon sat down heavily,
across my table.
She had put off the Date. She
said they shouldn’t hurry so.
I felt like reminding him that
less than two weeks before, it was
Rita who couldn’t set the Date any
too soon. But what good would it
have done? So I didn’t. Remind
him, I mean
In January, we moved to a new
office.
Working-schedules were changed.
Rita had to stay for the telephone
calls until nine at night. Leon
could leave at five. But usually he
stayed until Rita could go home.
That was until Rita took to
scolding him and making him go
home—for his own health! So he
thought! So she said!
But Leon didn’t see Filo sharing
her supper-basket with her. He
didn’t see Filo’s off-hand compli¬
ments making Rita glow didn’t see
Rita playfully slap Filo’s impudent
hands.
Leon didn’t see much of anything
else but the infrequent smiles
during Rita’s rare moments of in¬
dulgent good humor.
Leon smiled when his attention
was called to the rather brazen way
Filo took to stopping at Rita’s
table whenever he had a chance.
That was all right. He was a
sport. A sucker, not a sport I felt
like telling him. But I didn’t. If
I did, he wouldn’t have believed
me. He would have said I was pre¬
judiced.
So all one could do was wait un¬
til......
EON'S footsteps were light
L they couldn’t be distinguished
from the numerous other pairs of
feet going up and down the office
stairs. He had some typing to catch
up with.
He paused at the closed door of
the office room he and Filo shared.
Opened the door without arriving
at any valid reason why the door
should be closed
Rita and Filo were sharing sup¬
per.
Leon paused on the threshold.
Then, he went to his table. Opened
a drawer, took out some papers,
closed the drawer.
Rita spoke as he was pocketing
his keys. Her voice raced as if to
make up for the wordless gap that
had hung in the air.
Have you had your supper? Won’t
you join us. Anything other than
eloquent silence. Filo joined in aft¬
er completing the passage of a fork


that had hung in mid-air.
“Come on, 'Eon. There’s enough
for all.
“Thanks.” And slowly he walked
towards the door.
He was wondering as he reached
the ground if the laughter he heard
had floated down from upstairs.

IF I WERE DICTATOR

sibilities as inhabitants of an in¬
dependent nation.
By Dr. ANGEL B. TRINIDAD
Ececutive Secretary,
P. I. Antituberculosis Society
S a medidal man and execu¬
tive secretary of the P. I.
A Antituberculosis Society, I
would advocate certain reforms
which would make the govern¬
ment place more emphasis on the
control of the spread of tubercu¬
losis throughout the Archipelago.
More than 30,000 people are dying
yearly from this disease. Such a
mortality rate is very appalling
and anybody need not stretch his
imagination to visualize that the
entire country is engaged in a si¬
lent war against this dreaded
disease.
The country suffers serious eco¬
nomic losses from the white plague
due to the shortening of life expec¬
tation, the cost of medical attend-
ance, the loss of earnings and wa¬
ges, and deaths. One million tu¬
berculous people is considered a
reasonable estimate, or 8.33 per
cent of the total population of the
Islands. This conservative esti¬
mate is taken from different sur¬
veys in the past which placed the
number of tuberculosis patients be¬
tween 500,000 and 2,000,000.
Insurance authorities agree on
the fact that tuberculosis shortens
the average life expectation of
every individual by two and one¬
half years. Figured on the basis
of P100 for every year thus lost, or
P250 per capita, our Commonwealth
with a tuberculous population in-
curs a loss of P250,000,000. The
usual stay of tuberculous patients
in our sanatorium is about one year
at an average cost of P900 each.
They must have in some way med-
ical treatment for the same period
whether they stay at home or not.
Figuring only at P240 per patient,
our 1,000,000 tuberculous popula¬
tion will entail a total expenditure
of P240,000,000. These patients, at
least two and one-third years be¬
fore they die, remain in bed and
are unable to do any work. Placing
their earning capacity at P360 per
annum, 1,000,000 consumptives lose
a total of P360,000,000. A man or
a woman between the ages of 20
and 59 is easily worth ₱10,000 at
least. The total toll from pul¬
monary tuberculosis in 1929 was
30,603, of which 22,340 were adults
between the ages of 20 and 59.
Hence, their death meant a total
loss of P223,400,000.
All these losses amount to the

grand total of P1,073,400,000. Veri¬
ly, an appalling economic waste re¬
sulting from ignorance, social im¬
perfections, and neglect. One of the
urgent and needed reforms, there¬
fore, should be centered also on so¬
cial, economic, and hygienic prob¬
lems of the peop'e. Should these re¬
forms be carried out, much of the
total loss of P1,073,400,000 could be
saved.
By H. CRUZ
Former Director, Burogu of Labor
F I were given full control of
our government, I will im¬
Amediately establish here a
State which is not completely de¬
pendent upon taxation.
Under my plan, taxes will be im¬
posed as at present but taxes will
not serve as the principal mainstay
of the government. On the other
hand, I will make the government
a self-sustaining entity by making
it engage in profitable industries
which are as yet undeveloped.
A government supported by con¬
tributions, in the form of taxes, is
a very unstable government. Why
is our government afraid of so¬
called "big business”? Because it
cannot afford to “kill the goose
that lays the golden egg." A gov-
ernment that is self-sustaining and
independent enjoys the love and re¬
spect of the people.
Also, I will make it a principal
duty of the government to give
employment to the jobless. If our
Constitution provides that it shall
be one of the principal duties of
the State to guard the rights of the
citizens, then it should also be its
duty to look after the welfare of,
and give employment to, all.
By ENRIQUE ALTAVAS
Chief, General Land Registration
EGISTRATION of private
lands under the Land Re¬
I gistration Act should be
encouraged. Torrens titles are al¬
ways demanded by banks, loan
corporations, and money lenders
whenever lands are offered as
securities for mortgage loans.
A Torrens title always increases
the value of the land from the mo¬
ment of its issuance, because it
quiets the possession of same with-
out any limitation and affords pro¬
tection against fraud.
The lack of a Torrens title has
been the cause of many landown-
ers’ failing in their efforts to ob¬
tain loans with which to develop
their lands and falling into the
hands of usurers.
Land registration may be en¬
couraged if ten judges are ap¬
pointed with no other jurisdiction
except to try and decide ordinary
and cadastral land registration ca¬
ses, creating ten districts, each one
under a judge. That means that
they will have to devote their en¬
tire time to the work of handling
such cases from the first to the last
step. Judges now do not seem to
be very fond of such work, because


of its monotony, their preferences
being civil, criminal, and miscella¬
neous cases.
One very advisable reform would
be to place in one office or bureau
all the registries now found scat¬
tered. Land registry, civil regis¬
try, deeds registry, corporations
registry, mining registry, voters"
registry, mercantile registry, mort-
gage registry, titles registry, pro¬
tocols registry, notarial public in¬
struments registry, etc., are all un¬
der the charge of a Registrar Gen¬
eral in some countries.
Registration of public land un¬
der the Public Land Act should
also be encouraged so that more
homesteads, leases, sales, etc., may
be granted to individuals and cor¬
porations. The more grants or pa¬
tents are issued the better, because
the grantees will develop and culti¬
vate such lands, and the country in
general will be benefited because
there will be more wealth and more
work, solving incidentally, the pro¬
blem of unemployment.


PENALIZING THE DESERVING 
Continued from page 7
To give them ₱100 would mean a
salary promotion of more than one
grade for one year.
Several of these P36-lawyers took
this matter up with their respective
bureau directors. But they lost,
wholesale, their first case. They
were coldly shown the 1933 cabi¬
net resolution, made when salary
slashes were imperative and proper
promotions unwarranted.
Retrenchment policy, goverment¬
al economy, was the reason, accord¬
ing to Director Gil. Many of them
left the service disgusted. Others,
still unpromoted, fearing the vicis¬
situdes of early years in the law
profession, stay on.
Went Around Order
One of them, a bureau of lands
employee, however, went around the
order. He resigned his P36-job, and
then applied for the position of law
clerk. He was appointed at P80 a
month. Now, others are talking:
how did he do it? Was he favored


by his superiors? Again, did the
civil service miss this reappoint-
ment, when they were so strict with
grade promotion for the others?
And, by the way, ask the govern¬
ment employees. The merit system

strictly adhered to they will tell
you. Of course, the civil service and
Director Gil are not to blame. The
trouble lies with division chiefs and
bureau heads who have superiors to
obey and influential friends to
please.
Public Works Irregularity
Take the bureau of public works,
as an instance. Several were ap¬
pointed temporary automobile in¬
spectors at P1,200 a year. Because
of President Quezon’s order, they
took the civil service examinations
last September. All of them flunked.
Four clerks in the division of mo¬
tor vehicles, however, passed.
Now, you ask: are these four
clerks inspecting automobiles now?
Not, by any chance! Their appoint-

It appeared that two Hindus
were rivals in the artesian water
business in Manila. It was caimed
that to inflict injury to his rival,
Hindu A hired a thug to assault his
competitor. Hindu B and the thug
were arrested for street fighting.
When the trial came, the thug—on
legal technicalities—was acquitted
and Hindu B fined P5.00.
Amor propio would not have come
in had not Hindu A always appeared
in court and gave moral and, it was
said, pecuniary support to the
gangster. That got the other Hin¬
du’s goat, so to speak. So he brought
the case to the court of first in¬
stance and, losing in his appeal
there, e'evated the case to the Sup-
mere Courtr In the meantime, he
has likewise forgotten to manage
his artesian water business. Which
was just what the other Hindu had
wanted him to do.


THE OTHER SIDE OF
D
Continued from page 47


still be delays in the disposal of
cases, not because of the rules er
of the inefficiency of judges, but
because of other factors usually at¬
tendant upon lawsuits. The causes


of these delays may be grouped as
follows:
1. The dilatory tactics of law¬
yers in their pleadings in order to
gain some advantage, instead of
plunging direct'y into the merits of
the cases. This tactic is usually re¬
sorted to by lawyers who have a
poor case.
2. The numerous motions for
postponement that lawyers present,
in order to assure payment of their
fees before the trial of a case.
Many a time, an attorney is not
pa’d anything in advance nor even
after the case is finished, even
though he wins it.
3. Another unavoidab'e cause of
de ay in judicial proceedings is the
interpretation of the testimony at
the trial. The records must either
be in Spanish or English accord¬
ing to law. The testimony of all the
witnesses is translated into either
of the two languages. Oftentimes
the translation takes as much time
as the original testimony, and a
great part of the t’me of the court
is lost thereby. If this interpreta¬
tion could be dispensed with, our
courts can easily dispose of double
the number of cases that they can
now handle.

ments have been hanging fire since

a flunker inspector moved heaven

A former secretary of the interior
(now in the government again), a
provincial governor, and a depart¬

has been designated inspector of

For curiosity, let us ask: Does
he inspect bridges? No, he still
arrests chauffeurs and cancels their
licenses. Inspector Gonzalo Ruiz,
son of Director Ruiz of the bureau

self and to the government. He re¬

GOODBYE, SWEEPSTAKES

Continued from page 3
ing hospitalization.
We, of course, desire here the de¬
velopment of athletics for in the
long run it will be beneficial to the
national health. But considering
that the need to fight tuberculosis
is more immediate, it is anomalous
to place more emphasis on athletic
equipment than in proper accom¬
modations for the millions suffer¬
ing from the white plague.
The people of this country wil
forever be thankful to their Presi¬
dent for his courage in abolishing
the sweepstakes which is already
beginning to show signs of want-
ing to be a permanent institution.
While it has enriched only around
a dozen individuals, it has greatly
burdened the masses who managed,
by going into debts or sacrificing
the more urgent necessities of food
or clothing, to buy tickets every
time there is a sweepstake. With
the sweepstakes finally abolished,
the masses can settle down once
more to the task of thinking seri¬
ously that there is only one way
to get ahead, and that is, by work¬
ing and not by gambling.

COMMENTS


Gift


—OME government departments have
IMPROVEMENT, BUT...
S abolished the long-standing prac-
tice of giving the half-day holiday every day during the carnival season.
In some departments, half the employees get the half-day vacation one
day, the other half, the next, alternately.
It is curious to note that the abolition of the privilege in some de-
partments is premised on the fact that employees do not go to the car¬
nival during their half-day vacation but at night anyway. Therefore the
vacation does not benefit the carnival, the principal beneficiary of the
ruling. The gainer, of course, are the government employees. And the
loser, naturally, are the government and the public which cannot trans¬
act urgent business with the government in the afternoon during the
carnival season.
If it is not helping the carnival any, why continue the unnecessary
privilege?
* * *
THINK ITOVER mE HE prohibition against salary increases
I over one civil service grade has been sev¬
erely attacked on the ground that its operation has prevented many a
deserving government employee from receiving the salary increase due
them as a result of promotions to higher jobs. The clerk of court for
the Court of Appeals cannot be paid the designated salary of P4,000 a
year because this salary will mean an increase of more than one civil
service grade. It is claimed that this is unfair. We believe it is.
The abolition of this ruling is now being sought because of the in¬
justice it has done to a number of individuals serving in the govern¬
ment. But why not only a modification? A modification that will give
justice to those to whom an injustice has been committed through the
operation of this order? On the whole the ruling has worked satis¬
factorily in the sense that it has stopped indiscriminate promotions and
thus saved the government a great deal of money. It does not look
logical, when there is another reorganization in the offing to make fur¬
ther savings in the operation of the government machinery, to discard
this ruling altogether.
YN view of the nation-wide drive ordered by
ONLY LOGICAL
I the President against gambling, it is only
logical that he should finally register himself against the permanence of
the sweepstakes. The government cannot decently cry against vice,
campaign against it, fine and imprison vice addicts and vice maintainers
while at the same time encouraging vice through the maintenance of the
sweepstakes.
ng
Moreover, it appears that the one institution which should benefit
most from the proceeds of the sweepstakes, the Philippine Antituber¬
culosis Society, is not getting the share appropriate for the undertaking
to which this institution is dedicated. As to the other beneficiaries, in
proportion to their importance, they may expect from the government
coffers what it can afford to give.

HEALTHY SIGN xT is encouraging to note that educational in¬
I stitutions led in the celebration of ¡Consti¬
tution Day last February 19th. They should lead. For they harbor
within their halls the very men and women who can be most instru¬
mental in instilling in the hearts of the rest of the population deep rever¬
ence for the fundamental law of the land. Without that deep rever¬
ence, the best written constitution will not mean a thing. It will be
just another scrap of paper.

Standard Of Living
A great many patriot-economists
talk their heads off on the necessity
of preserving our standard of living.
What standard of living?
The standard of living of a few
Manilans and the few well-heeled
ones scattered in the provinces?
Look beyond the city and big
towns, into the barrios, dear patriots
and economists, and find out what
our standard of living really is.
There you will find the standard of
living of the people of the country.
It is foolish to talk about guard¬
ing against the lowering of the
standard of living of the country. It
is impossible to push it down any
lower.

He Who Laughs Last
mHE board of directors of the
A sweepstakes office, it ap¬
pears, was too sure of itself.
It fired Auditor Ticman of the
sweepstakes because the auditor
chose to obey civil service regula¬
tions and disobeyed the board
which by its very act implied: to
heck with, civil service rules.
But it so happens that Malaca¬
nang never tires of producing mira¬
cles. Mr. Ticman appealed to Ma¬
lacanang, another of the miracles
happened. Result: Mr. Ticman
stays with the sweepstakes office
as auditor.
