YITHER ARE ME GOING?
By Avelina Borja
ve are not of this sarth, but we
ara travelers in the long caravan
of souls with ambitions for progress who happened to be detailed
momentarily on this planet, so tift
we might be able to gather facts
about eternal life, we are here
on earth to learn the myatery, of
our own existence in consonance
with the most perfect pattern of
eternal bliss. God, in His most
divine Jisdom and Love, gave us
the guiding light, the word of Tuth
so that we may be able to give proper credence to our deeds. Says
the Law: "A tooth for a tooth and
eye for an eye". In the words of
our Spirit Protector: "whatever we
do on this earth will be duly oompensated" Love begets love; hate
be gets hate. If we could afford
to forget and forgive for
the
sake of the Divine doctrine of
Love, then it will not be a failure if we continue to sow the ged
pf truth and preach the doctrine
of Love' and Forgiveness. As sweet
as the thought of forgiveness is
the thought that we are always
struggling and helping our
OWn
selves and others too for the batterment of the common society in
which we live. Then and only then
can we hope to free our salves
little by little from the tormente
of this earthly existenca; then
can we achieve thru incessant
struggle our cherishad goal --
that Life Eternal -- which is no.t
of this earth but in the House of
Our Father who is in heaven. A
little of kindness, a little desd
of charity, these count much in
our life. Charity for the sake of
our soul, our ego, these are the


beckoning lights in our path leading to the realm of our Lord. We
came to this earth as the angels
came , then we knew the Law of Life. We sin and now and then we repant. We listen to the voice of
Truth, to the Light of Love, 'Je try
to give much of our goodness for
the sake of our doctrine -- Charity --; we try to gather the
pearls of our own charitable acts
to adorn our inner-self. We are
preparing to go out of this planet, to the exit of our sufferings,
so that someday, by the light of
heaven, thru the help of God Almighty, wa may be able to achieve
nobler aims, nobler ideala, that
we may some day serve not only
ourselves, but also the many travelers on this earth who are of ten
misled by mere ignorance and indolenos. Whare are wa going? Neour going someday uhere the angels live to the land of contentment and perfact bliss. We are
goinrg to the realm of God Almighty

IMAGE OF LOY
By Bonifacio Aguilan
Provincial Inspector
Jesus Christ is the perfect image of LOVE. All His taachings in
words and in deeds are summed up
in LOVE.
Love is the complete unfoldment
of all good of one living being
for another. All good in word, in
thought, and in deed. One sees,
feels, and thinks good in all even
unto the enemies.
our Master pointed to the littla babies as the heirs of the
kingdom of heaven. Watch the
little babies. How they look.
