Ethiopians And
Italians Both
Claim Victory


Ever since the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian war there hav e been numerous conflicting reports about which of the opposing
armies won in their many engagements. That the claims of victor y by the Ethiopians were not exaggerated may be seen in the above
photo showing an Italian tank captured by Selassie's troops.


— yITH both Italian and Ethio¬
pian army officials claim¬
ing victory for their res¬
pective sides, one of the bloodiest
weeks in the Italo-Ethiopian war
ended with the forces of both na¬
tions still clashing. Enormous
casualties were registered on each
side, and Emperor Selassie was
compelled to issue another forced
mobilization order. As the battle
raged, the Ethiopian situation on
the European front headed for the
worse when Italy warned sanction¬
ist nations, and the world, that
Great Britain’s action in arranging
a Mediterranean security pact


constituted “danger for European
peace."
On January 23rd, an official
communique issued at Addis Aba¬
ba revealed that “theusands of
Italian lives" wele lost in a great
battle on the northern front.
large quantity of war materials
was captured from the Italians.
The Abyssinians, the communique
stated, have repulsed several Ital¬
ian attacks and have started laun¬
ching counter-attacks.
On January 24th, Italy’s army,
chasing Ras Demtu’s forces, seized
all water holes, cut off all Ethiop-


ian water supply. At Rome, it was
reported the following day that the
northern offensive had resulted in
763 Italian fatalities and 5,000
Ethiopian casualties.
Ras Desta’s army, in spite of its
numerical inferiority, checked the
Italian advance Iralian reports
that Ras Desta’s former headquar¬
ters at Neghalli were occupied by
Italian motorized advanced guards
were denied at Addis Ababa. The


Ethiopian government has
nounced that the Ethiopian troop.
have encircled Makale, announced
also that two Fascist columns dis¬
patched to rescue the garrison have
been routed and captured.
Italy warned sanctionist na¬

“The greatest spenders did not earn
the money themselves. Their par-
ents did that for them. That is
why they feel so free in spending
it so uselessly.”
Others decry that these society-
minded people should know that
there are, by far, higher things in
this world that can give more sat-
isfaction, more pleasure. That is
the greater satisfaction of leading
the ignorant.
Dr. Antonio Isidro, chairman of
the U P. literacy campaign, is of
the belief that college peop'e can do
a lot of welfare work by becoming
self-appointed teachers of the mas¬
ses. Rather than spend most of
their time in social pleasures, they
can, by devoting a portion of their
hours, improve the lot of their less
fortunate neighbors by telling them
of the finer things in life, guiding
them so they can find their way to
a cleaner, happier, saner life.
Another young man, who has
seen much of society but who, for
obvious reasons, prefers to remain
anonymous said:
“Everything society people do is
meaningless, worthless,
There is
no object, no aim. There’s a ball,
a party perhaps in the house of a
socialite. Well, we simply do a lot

an absent fellow-member into tat-

degree on its annual yield. This
ranges all the way from a hundred

the mortgagee belongs half of the

while mangos that are not grafted
bear fruit only after their tenth
year, grafted ones do so as early
as the third year.
However, there is a joke!
Grafted mangoes do bear fruit
early. But as one cynical old man,
who owns a dozen mango trees as
old as himself but still yielding
him annually about a thousand
pesos, observed: “So what? A
grafted mango bears fruit early
enough, but of what use is that?
You pick all its fruits and eat them
at one sitting and there is still a
great void in your belly. You see,
one can’t expect to gather plenty of
fruit from a few branches."
There was truth in what the old
man said. So much truth, in fact,
that I was persuaded to change my
mind after having told a tenant of
mine to destroy all the pineapple
plants in his holding and have them
replaced with grafted mango trees.
Over no other fruit tree in the
Philippines is the triumph of
science over nature (as practised
by the local husbandman) more
complete than over the mango.

Physicians Have No Right To Kill
LAW, MEDICAL ETHICS, RELIGION PROHIBIT HASTENING
OF DEATH OF INCURABLES
By DR. PABLO ANZURES
Assistant Professor of Legal Medicine, U. P.


 HOULD a supposedly incura¬
ble, hopeless, invalid suffer¬
S ing constant pain and beg¬
ging for a quicker and easier death
be granted that mercy by a physi¬
cian?
The answer, as far as this writer
is concerned, is no. In the first
place, when a supposedly incurable
invalid requests his physician to
put an end to his (the invalid’s)
life, he is actually asking the phy-
sician to aid him in the commission
of suicide.
We read in the press that there
is a movement headed by Lord Moy-
nihan, a famous English surgeon,
to legalize quick death. Among his
followvers are Ladv Denman, chair¬
an of the National Federation of
men’s Institutes, and Dean Inge,
eminent churchman. According
the proponents of the plan, pub¬
minion in England is extremely
wvorable at the present time to the
acceptance of an “easy death" pro¬
gram.
In spite of whatever movements
there may be outside of this coun¬
try towards euthanasia it is still
believed that, considering the tra¬
ditions, idiosyncrasies, and general
nature f our peopie as well as the
existing in the Islands,
lay
such a movement cannot as yet gain
acceptance among our people.
As has been mentioned at the be¬
ginning, when a physician follows

wrote to the insular treasurer,

lease P7,000,000 for the London-
Theld Manila ailroad bonds. The
fremaining amount will come
Ifrom the United States treasury
lout of the Philippine government
freserves there.


Dr. Pablo Anzures of the U p
college of medicine: “‘The mission of
the physician is principally to help
nature in the alleviation of human
suffering.”


the wishes of a supposedly incurable
patient and administers drugs that
will end his life, he is in fact as¬
sisting the patient to commit sui¬
cide. This act per se is against the
existing laws of this country. Art-
icle 253 of the Revised Penal Code
clearly and definitely states that
any physician who shall assist an¬
other to commit suicide shall suf¬
fer the penalty of prision mayor
and if such person lends his assist¬
ance to another to the extent of do¬
ing the killing himself he shall suf¬
fer the penaity of reclusion tem¬
poral. A physician therefore who
commits this act, that is, lends his
assistance to his patient to the ex¬
tent of doing the killing himself
will subsequently suffer imprison¬
ment from 12 years and 1 day to
20 years.
Unless this legal provision is re-
pealed or amended, whether we like
it or not or whether or not public
opinion is in favor of the plan, the
fact remains that in practising eu¬
thanasia the physician is running
the risk of suffering the corres¬
ponding penalties provided by law.
Furthermore, is there a physician
or surgeon who can definitely and
conclusively say that a given case
is incurable? As the saying goes,
there is nothing impossible; hence,
one supposedly incurable is not com¬


pletely without hope of recovery or
at least an improvement in his con¬
dition. Cases have been reported
of patients already abandoned by
their physicians as incurable, who
afterwards, either recovered com-
pletely or improved and lived many
more years thereafter. There is
always the possibility of error in
diagnosis, for science is not yet
perfect. There is still room for im¬
provement in the different branches
of medicine. There are, in fact, as
vet so many inexplicable things in
medical science.
Again, persons suffering from
lingo ing illness, especially the kind
accompahied by pain and discom¬
fort and associated with seme de¬
gree of blood poisoning, are usually
rather unbalanced in mind. It is
an accepted fact that the mentality
of an individual is affected in vary¬
ing degrees by disease. It is not
necessary to be a physician to ap-
preciate the change in the temper
of a tuberculous patient. It is
therefore clear that a patient’s plea
for help to end life cannot be taken
seriously as the patient in his con¬
dition is incapable of weighing
things aright.
And above everything else, all
physicians are aware of the ethics
of the profession which cover this
point. Dr. Sixto de los Angeles in
his textbook on forensic medicine
says that medical ethics regards as
the doctor’s duty to save life and
not to take it, also that inasmuch
as no person has the right to end
his own life, much less can he de¬
legate such a right to another.
Lastly, Christianity is against
this practice, inasmuch as it is in
fact the commission of suicide.
While it is true that once there
were “epidemics of suicide” which,
according to St. Augustine were
carried out by members of certain
sects of the early church who threw
themselves from cliffs in the belief
that they were doing martyrdom
which will secure for them eternal
salvation, later historical data
show that Christians as a whole
abhor suicide. During the earlier
period of the Spanish regime, it
is said that the bodies of suicides
were never accorded the usua re¬
ligious rites and refused burial in


Catholic cemeteries. Likewise, ma¬
sons are not allowed to aid or as¬
sist in the burial of persons who
committed suicide. This is due to
the fact that both the person com-
mitting suicide and the individual
helping in the commission of this
self-destruction are violating one
of the ten commandments: “Thou
shalt not kill” (Exodus, Chap. XX,
Verse 13).
The most that a physician can do
to help a patient in his suffering
is to administer drug or apply
some treatment that may lessen or
alleviate the pain. For in the last
ana'ysis, the mission of the phy-


 pader the present laws and considering present
consolation. Quick relief, as death, they may not have

AInd Economie Reasons Justify
Euthanasia


U. P Professor, However, Does Not Recommend Euthanasia-
Believes This Generation Not Ready For Idea


From An Interview With A Professor Of Sociology
University of the Philippines


rO defend or justify the ends
sought by euthanasia is to go
L against the law, medical
hics, morality, and religion.
I am, personally, of the opinion
nat our age is not yet ready for
ithanasia. “Thou shalt not kill,"
ays one of the Ten Command¬
ients, and as a Christian I cannot
ecommend or sanction death to any
lan, no matter what his sufferings
nay be. Besides, the tendency in


euthanasia to-day?
Nevertheless, taking into consi¬
deration social and economic prob¬
lems one may understand, without
necessarily agreeing with euthana¬
sia. Not being a physician but a
mere student of sociology, I shall
discuss the subject from the point
of view of sociology and not from
the viewpoint of medical science.
The ancient Greeks practised eutha¬
nasia as a means of improving their
race. It was a simple practice then,
as it involved the killing of all mis¬
fits. The result of the practice is
known to history. The Greeks were
able to develop one of the best ra¬
stocks in that section of the
mainent * the time.
amavega ding all other consider¬
ations then, cathanasia appeals as
nm to protont the good qiab ies
of a aae At present three maans
are offered ve acmlisn that end.
The first is segregaon, the sec-
ond sterilization, and the third.
euthanasia. Sociologists and sociai¬
welfare workers, it should be said
here, are not in agreement as to
which of the three offers the best
results.


hat the incurable can hope for is spiritual


Il enlightened countries is towards
le preservation of human life and
le recognition of an individual’s
ght to live unless he forfeits that
ght through the commission of
y crime punishable by death. In
le bill of rights of almost all con¬
itutions adopted by civilized and
mmocratic countries of the world,
read: “No person shall be de¬
ived of life, liberty, or property
moat due proces at
ow then can anyone, living in a
meralic souniry, recommend


greatest good for the greatest num¬
ber.
Notwithstanding all good reasons
advanced by physicians against
their right to kill an individual,
euthanasia, it seems, is to be fav-
ored in certain well-defined cir¬
cumstances. The government spends


In connection with the discussion
of euthanasia, the question is
asked: Does the individual exist for
the state or the state for the indi¬
vidual? Whether the killing of
suffering individuals and misfits is
justified or not depends upon the
answer to the question. If, as
some contend, the individual ex¬
ists for the state or for the
group, which means that the
individual is merely a “tool” of
the state, then the state or the
group has the right to get rid of
him the moment he is no longer use¬
ful or necessary. More so is this
true if he represents a danger or
a burden to the state and the group.
However, if democracy may be
interpreted to mean that society’s
efficient functioning must aim for
the greatest good for the greatest
number, then it is certainly a case
in point to ask whether euthanasia
cannot be justified.
If it is true that democracy
is the greatest good for the great¬
est number, then the state is not
doing the greatest good for the
greatest number if it maintains the

sums of money for the mentally de-
fective, for imbeciles, the insane,
and other human beings afflicted
with incurable diseases.
Has this group of individuals the
right to impose upon the state and
upon the normal members of so¬
ciety? If, as everybody admits, it
is true that they are a burden to
society, then one may well ask what
ends is served in keeping these un¬
fortunates and this suffering
mass of humanity alive for many
painful and useless years. Anyway
we look, at the question, euthanasia
is economical to the state and eco¬
nomical to the families affected,
that is, economically and socially
speaking.

Just How Free Are Yow In Mamila?
DO WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE DOING AND YOU
WILL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH


NCE in a while a policeman
gets in the mood and one
finds himself, if a cigar or
a promise can’t fix it, explaining
things to the judge. Sometimes he
gets away with the trite I-won’t-
do-it-again plea. Most pinches,
however, result in fines if not
arrelto prison terms.
A fine after a deft pinch, so rat¬
itles us up we vehemently ask
where that constitutional guaran¬
tee for the enjoyment of life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness
is. What are we pinched for when
laws are made for our own protec¬
tion?
Indeed, just how far can one, say
a Manilan, go without himself in
the clutches of the law? Just how
much personal liberty does a per¬
son have?
For example, one may freely
walk on the narrow sidewalks back
and forth. Sidewalk magazine
stalls may vex him, but he
kick against them
right to ha
Gu
square
games, space permitting,


and public places. But sports, con¬
ducted along streets, are allowed
only during national holidays and
the patron saint’s day of the parti¬
cular district, and that with a per¬
mit issued by the city mayor.
You may not like the kind of
meat they sell at the market. Well,
go ahead and raise your own meat:
ffatten a pig, a lamb or a goat in
the backyard. But don’t kill for
consumption any pig or calf less
than five weeks old, or any lamb or
kid less than two months old. Just
why, the city ordinances fail to ex¬
plain.
If you are a car owner you can
buy any amount of gasoline for
private use, but if it is over ten
gallons, don’t forget to first sec¬
ure a permit from the city hall to
store more. The same thing with
alcohol and other inflammable lig¬
uids for private use.
f the call of the cards is irresist-
the law allows you to play
tuingue, Filipino cuajo, mah¬
chua bo, and capicua. But
play them from 8:00 a. m to 12:00
p.m, on Sundays and holidays, not
every day. You can play every day,
of course, but better have P50.00

can be played on the city’s streets ready. That’s the amount of fine,
not to mention a perfect set of fin¬
ger-prints at the police station.
Likewise, you can dance. But
don’t engage in, hold, abet, or con¬
duct any marathon dance in any
public place. Nor can you have the
personal liberty, much as you like
it, to promote or engage in any
similar sport or entertainment pro¬
ductive of physical exhaustion. The
law will see to it that you get some
forced rest.
You can get drunk any time you
want; but do it, silently, inside
your house and within your pre¬
mises. Your basi or San Miguel
orgy must not, in any way, cause
annoyance to another person. Any¬
body can get hilarious in a public
place, but let him start getting rude
or appear drunkenly boisterous and
you can have him taken to the pol¬
ice station for annoying you.


Bare backs, but not sun baths,
are allowed in cosmopolitan Manila.
So don’t open your windows too
wide when sun-bathing, when pur¬
itan spinsters are at their own
windows watering their flower
pots. But you can get even with
them, for lodging a complaint
against you, by going—at some
opportune time—under their win-
dows and getting splashed. Then
you can make faces at them with
your counter action for violating
Section 860 of Manila’s revised
ordinances.
By the way, do your feather or
brush tickling on your husband
alone. And, don’t forget that the
time to throw flour, talcum, soot,
or any other pulverized substance
at any enemy is when the police-
man’s back is turned.
Of course, carnival time will

But last week, evidence was
unearthed that raised doubt that
Encallado, as he claims, has clean
hands. The evidence is the ex¬

was discovered by Laguna volan¬
teers.
Taguiloso, a Cavinti election
inspector, was killed last May,
and signed statements made by
Marcos and Sotero Conde def¬
initely linked Encallado with the
murder. According to the Con¬
des it was Encallado who dragged
the unfortunate election inspec-
tor bya he neck while Encallado’s
henchmen prepared to kill the
victim. This statement was made
when the Condes were arrested
in connection with the killing.
Sotero had since escaped from
jail and is now in hiding in the
mountains.


Subanuns Celebrate
Once .1 Year
They Gather After Harvest
And Dance And Eat
By L. ARCELO QUIBRANZA


The Subanuns of Zamboanga hold a
yearly festival after their harvest, accord¬
ing to tribal customs and traditions, dur¬
ing which they dance and eat and make
merry. Above is a typical Subanun.


loosely constructed bamboo square
stage.
Three pairs of skillful men and
women usually perform the sinolog
of the Subanuns. The agongs start
and the dancers step onto the stage
and dance, after the fashion of the
wild people, gesticulating and jump-
ing to keep their precarious balance.
For the stage swings here and there,
it tips to one side, then swiftly dips
to the other, or it sinks and rises,
depending on whether the dancers
can manage to separate themselves
from each other to maintain the bal¬
ance of the loosely constructed
stage. To one unused to such weird
dancing, it would seem as if the
performers were "angels” lost in the
storm-black clouds, fluttering des¬
perately here and there.
The unusual presentation, albeit
thrilling and stomach-sinking at the
start, soon becomes tiresome. For
the same wild jumping and tribal
dancing go on, with slight varia¬
tions. Only the dancers, who have
become fagged out, are replaced by
fresh and daring ones. Now and
then also, the dull beatings of the
agongs are muted, or replaced by a
two-stringed guitar which emits a
sound that is both sharp and pene¬
trating.
Dinnertime is much more inte¬
resting, to the hungry. About noon
the Subanuns shout in their tongue,
"Dinner is served!” A man dis¬


tributes the free lunch, handing the
visitors clean banana bundles con¬
taining native food of meat and
fish. Usually the guests are gen¬
erously given many bundles, each
bundle containing the best of the
Subanun’s culinary art.
Food, during this fiesta-time is
so plentiful that it is not infrequent
a man carries his heavy share on his
back. Once he has received his
share, the merry-maker is free to
eat it anywhere, or to depart for
home with his bundles and partake
of them with the members of his
family. But, if you are a Chris¬


If you are one of those who have
almost given up hope of ever finding
anything that will make your teeth
look attractive, try the new Kolynos
way of cleaning them.
All you do is put just a half-inch
of Kolynos on a dry brush. Stains
that have bothered you so long dis¬
appear completely. Millions of decay¬
causing germs are killed at once.


tian and therefore unfamiliar with
the Subanun’s viands then beware!
For they are very fond of snakes
cooked in different ways!
After the meal, all are welcome
to drink from the big clay jars con¬
taining pangasi, rice wine, the qual¬
ity of which is similar to the tapoi
of the Igorots. They drink it using
long tube-like twigs, thus allowing
many persons to imbibe the pangasi
at the same time. Satiated, they
hand their drinking tubes to the
thirsty ones waiting for their turn.

1935 despite America’s Gene Smith
and Wayne Gordon, Australia’s D.
Thompson and A. Hasset, and
China’s V. T. Wong, Kho Hooi Hye,
and Dennis Chein?
Admirers of Gavia, who remem¬
ber only his masterful 1934 and
1935 victories, will rise as one man
and make the booming response:
“Yes!” But we, who belong to the
group of observant tennis fans—
Gavia admirers no less—and re¬
member vividly his, well, dis¬
appointing showing late last year.
will not answer: “Yes.” Because
the Gavia of the present year is so
different from the Gavia of a year
or so ago. We are of the opinion
that he is now definitely on the de¬
cline.
Occurrences of late show this to
be true. We refer to Gavia’s ex¬
hibition matches with the renowned
Henri Cochet, his encounter with
V. T. Wong in the dual meet be¬
tween the Shanghai Tennis Club
and the University of Santo Tomas,
and lastly his more recent meeting
with V. T. Wong in the semi-finals
of the Metropolitan men’s singles
championship.
Let us begin with the encounter
that first gave us an inkling of Ga¬
via’s descent: his last match with
Cochet. Thousands of tennis en¬
thusiasts witnessed that brief, in¬
glorious match. Gavia gave a scin¬
tillating account of himself only in
the first set. He made the famous
Frenchr
run all over the court
wit'
crafty placements. Cochet,
n won the set: 7-5. The Ga¬
via fanaties expected a master’s
ciet ror their idol in the second
 savi: “He has learned Co¬
ch. ". Pvie!”
But in the second set, the local
tennis king-pin blew up. He was
unprecedentedly erratic. He muf-
fed all opportunities to score by
netting his shots like a novice. The
set easily went to Cochet, 6-0. The


third set was a repetition of the
second. Cochet stormed the net
time and again and scored points.
Towards the end of this set, Gavia
fanatics began to handclap vigor¬
ously for him to put up more fight.
But it was apparent that he had no
more fight left. Cochet continued
his unerring net play unchecked and
won the set 6-3. And the match in
straight sets. A repetition of their
first encounter.
The outcome was utterly contrary
to what we expected: either a four-
set victory for Cochet or a five-set
win for Gavia. We felt very con¬
fident Gavia would give the French-
man his first drubbing in this neck
of the woods. And we reasoned that
Gavia’s first defeat was due not to
his second-rate tennis, but to stage
fright, so to speak. Imagine facing
Cochet!
After the match, we were so dis¬
appointed that, in answer to a
friend’s observation: “Gavia could
have done better,” we growled pet¬
ulantly: “No! That was his best.
He’s going down-hill now.”
Of
course we did not mean this—then.
It was petulance, born of extreme
disappointment that made us growl
this. Down deep in our heart, we
believed that if Gavia were given
third, fourth, etc. chances, he
would yet beat Cochet. The chances
came, but we did not see the
matches. News from the Visayas
stated that Gavia fared no better
there.
Our next opportunity to witness
Gavia in action came in the dual
meet between the visiting Shang¬
hai players anu those of the Univ-
ersity of Santo Tomas. We thought
very little of V. T. Wong; we
bragged Gavia could beat him left-
handed or blindfolded. But in his


Gavin, left, and Cochet, French vetaran
racquet-wielder. Gavia met defcat as the
Frenchmgn's hanos.


The Gavia brothers, Leonardo, left, and
Juanito, both prominent in local tennis
world. The former, an observer claims,
may not shine in future tournaments
and will fuil to keep his tennis title.


encounter with Gavia, he dum-
founded us with his sterling brand
of tennis.
Gavia, in this dual meet match,
was a complete disappointment the
first and second sets. Wong won
them handily. The third set Gavia
won after much exertion. In the
fourth set, with Gavia leading at
3-1, Wong developed cramps and
asked for a ten-minute rest. Gavia
breathed with relief; so did we.
When the play was resumed, a
dazzled gallery saw the fresh Wong
level the score at 3-all with his irre¬
trievable, lightning-like drives to

Roxas To Become
Finance
Secretary


Filipinos in the United States are, apparently, not in a hurry to go home.
Above are Filipinos in U. S. gathered at a party.
U. S. Filipinos Dor't Want To Co Hor


Assemblyman Manuel Roxas: probable
occupant of the post of finance secretary.
T is generally known that
shortly there will be changes
Ain the cabinet, It has been
rumored that Assemblyman Ro¬
xas will be taken out of the law-
naking body and seated as secre¬
tary of the department of finance.
From the finance department,
Secretary Quirino will shift to the
lepartment of public instruction
iow temporarily headed by Vice
resident Osmena. The Vice Pres¬


ident, it is understood, will devote
his time to helping the President
run the ship of state.
That there will be a change in
the cabinet line-up, at least in the
case of the department of finance,
is shown by the reported refusal of
Secretary Quirino to sign the ap-
pointment of the new chief of the
customs secret service, alleging that
out of courtesy to the incoming sec¬
retary, he (Sec. Quirino) should not
sign the appointment of a man
who will serve under another.
Educated for the law profession,
long in politics, Assemblyman Ro¬
xas is nevertheless considered emi¬
nently fitted for the post of secre¬
tary of finance. He is said to be
one of a few (very few) individu¬
als who understand thoroughly the
economic and financial problems of
the country.
To Capiz Assemblyman Roxas
went recently, allegedly to consult
his constituents about his going to
the cabinet. The assemblyman
stated in his own province, how¬
ever, that the post had not yet been
officially offered him. The fact
that in the organization of the As¬
sembly Roxas was not given any
responsible position is cited by ma¬
ny as tending to show that the ru¬
mor concerning his elevation to a
cabinet post is not hearsay.


—y HEN the depression came
and millions in America
W
including thousands of Fi¬
lipinos were thrown out of work,
it was believed that unemployed
Filipinos would go home if they
had the means. And because Fi¬
lipinos out of work compete with
unemployed Americans for avail¬
able jobs, congress was prevailed
upon to pass a law authorizing the
repatriation of unemployed Fili¬
pinos.
The law was passed last year and
to date only a little over 70 applica¬
tions were received from Filipinos
for free transportation home.


There are from 30,000 to 5 
Filipinos in the United Semte¬
From this it is apparent that
Filipinos do not or are not
hurry to return to the Philipjans
And for this reason the appropris
tion of $450,000 for repatri¬
has been reduced to $100,000 Ly
sub committee of the lower s
of Congress last week
It was explained that Ame ies
employers of Filipino labor ar
sponsible for the refusal of the
lipinos to return to their ra

Don't Follow Villa
Amador T. Daguio Counsels
New Writers -- Says Villa
Not A Responsible Critic


y ILLA is a modern pretender
to the new art; he glorifies

in his rebellion, there is a
suffering-hero type of defense
complex in him; in fact, he is all
suffering-hero complex. He cannot
forget his martyrdom in our
country, he is bitter about it; and
because he is so, he is good sub¬
ject for the psychiatrist. I want
to become a psychiatrist, if only
to tinker with Villa’s mentality.
There is nothing wrong with the
new art, I admit. We in this coun¬
try try to catch it, we are warmed
by it, we are inspirod by it. It is
true that our newspapers and ma¬
gazines print damnable pieces of
literary trash. That is not the
fault of the new writers; it is the
editors'. Our present-day editors,
at least most of them, are steeped
in the fog of tradition, in the sen¬
timentalisms of convention. And
we writers must satisfy them; it
is the only way to get our stuff
published. I spent many years try-
ing to satisfy requirements. I sold
my "art,” so to say. An editor once
told me: We want the breezy type,
the snappy, the, what Villa would
call, mawkish. I sold my made-to¬
order “art.” Could I help it?
was starving in a city and the only
way to live was to get money now
and then from the newspapers.
Villa’s great failing is that he
releases more thunder than is ne¬
cessary. He lacks poise; he is
over-exuberant. Even a cat can be
killed by too much enthusiasm.
How many new writers whom Villa
has praised to the heights still
write? Surely, Villa is responsible
for the literary extinction of many.
Another fault of Villa is he thinks
everybody other than followers of
Villa is wrong; all is dross that is


not Villa-ic, or better still, that is
not Villa-iny.
The true critic, He capitalizes,
has an understanding of the or¬
iginal mind. Villa cannot hope to
understand the "original mind” of
every writer in our country. He
understands only the "new rebels."
Rebels against what? We have no
literary tradition in our country,
we cannot rebel against anything.
Villa, instead of building, rebels
against nothing That is the new
art to him.
I should say we have been sin¬
cere in our attempt to create a real
Filipino literature. We are strug¬
gling against the editors and old
prejudices. So it is no use tear¬
ing us up into shreds by means of
noisy critical devaluations, mostly
quotations. The new Filipino writ¬
ers are rising; they will put our
country on the map. But the dan¬
ger is they cower at the feet of
Villa, try to imitate him. And Vi¬
lla as a soul is brazenly egotistical
and neurotic. He succeeds because
of his loud noise and his press¬
agenting audacity. Who will say
his book Footnote to Youth is a
landmark? It has faded from the
horizon; we all got sick of his
cabled success (?).
But I want to say this in justice.
Given Woman will not live. It is
Footnote to Youth (the short-story,
not the book) that will. All who
read the story Footnote to Youth
will never forget it. It is a gem
distinct, it is an eternal plant. The
reason? It has its birth in the soil,
the Filipino soil. It is only by re¬
vealing the distinct race, the dis¬
tinct country, that we create char-
acters of the high types, heroic and
eternal. Because in so doing, we
make them universal. The spirit


Amador T. Daguio: believes Villa
is not a responsible critic and
counsels young writers not to heed
his (Villa's) criticisms.


in man or woman devoid of the
flesh—therefore in the abstract, in
the free—seeking that which is
supreme and real in existence, is of
course the ideal. But we cannot
reach the ideal by doing away with
the form it inhabits, we cannot
manifest the spirit of man and wo¬
man by robbing them of the body.
They would become formless and
that which is formless is nothing;
if there were no use for form in
this universe, God would have
created us all disembodied.
The spirit of life is one. That
which makes it beautiful in the
consciousness of art is the way it
reacts to or acts upon so many
moulds: life in painting, life in
sculpture, life in music, in plastic
design, so to say. What Villa
strives for is to undress the spirit
of life, to make it naked and ab¬
stract. That which is disem¬
bodied is felt but is otherwise un¬
real because life seeks forms, pat¬
terns, moulds.
I therefore appeal to the new
groups of writers of the country to
write as they would. Let us in-
terpret the deep living truths that
we sense in this world about us
through their revelations in the
Filipino body, race, soil. That is
the only way to create a real Fili¬
pino literature, distinct from any
other. Don’t follow Villa, or any
other critic. He applies his critical
gropings to objectified art, or even
to no-art at all, without taking into
consideration the true background,
the "inner mind” of the writer. The
critic should be responsible; Villa
is not. The critic must put him¬
self into the writer’s place, be sym¬
pathetic with the latter’s purpose,
aspirations. Upon the writer’s
ability to achieve what he desires
fervently to achieve, will mean his
failure or success. If the writer’s
purpose is to write for money, let
that go. We don’t bother ourselves
about whether the piece is liter¬
ature or not, since the purpose then
is revealed. If the purpose is an
attempt to create art, then judge it
from the point of view of the
writer, his intention and grasp, not
from the perverse dogma of the
critic. I repeat, let us write in


spite of the critics, in spite of Jose
Garcia Villa. Critics must have
jobs; because if they don’t they
would starve. In order not to
starve, they must disturb the liter¬
ary horizon. And, anyway, gen¬
iuses rise into the world not be¬
cause but in spite of the critics.
Critics cannot make artists be¬
cause artists are not made in
the first place Critics are
only for the mediocres. Keats
was killed by the critics, but
he lives. If the critics did not bear
down upon Keats, they would have
starved. Keats went on in his
blaze of purple glory, however,
seeking the beauty that is joy for¬
ever, but what did the critics who
damned him know?
(Note to Jose Garcia Villa: This
piece has no pretentions to liter¬
ature; I surely will object strong¬
ly to your calling it a short-story.)

((YT came as an agreeable sur¬
prise to me,” Manuel Agre¬
gado, recently appointed de¬
puty auditor general, commented on
his appointment, “considering the
fact that President Quezon who
conferred upon me the great honor
did not know me personally."
Deputy Anditor General Agrega¬
io’s appointment is a patent evi¬
lence of the announced policy of
President Quezon to have "more
overnment and less politics” in the
idministration of the affairs of the
ommonwealth. President Quezon
was apprised of Mr. Agre¬
gado’s, capabilities and ef¬
icient service perhaps
hrough the latter’s present
nd former chiefs. The se-
lection of this public serv¬
mt to fill a post which car¬
ries great responsibility
and trust is a recognition of
his perseverance, sheer abil-
icy, and capacity for work,
rising as he did from the
iowest ranks.
Deputy Auditor General
gregado was born in Ba¬
angas, Batangas, forty-
cight years ago. His par¬
ents, Angel Agregado and
Vicenta Montalbo, had just
enough to keep both ends
together. Young Agregado
vas only two years old when
nis father died. “So, you
see,” he said, “I started
quite early on the rough
ind difficult road of mak¬
ng something out of my-
self. I have two brothers
and three sisters whom my
widowed mother took care
of besides me. Even then, I
had ambitions of becoming
a doctor. My mother want¬
ed me to be one. I would
have pursued that career,
too, had not Mother died
when I was barely sixteen.”
Young Manuel studied in
the public schools of his
home town. During vaca¬
tions while he was a high
school student he worked as
a salesman in an American store in
the town. In the high school he got
high ratings and managed to be in¬
cluded in the roll of honor. Among
his former classmates in that high
school are Judge Mariano H. de Jo¬
ya, Enrique Claudio (provincial
treasurer of Antique), and Juan F
Hilario, of the Manila Daily Bulle¬
tin.
He was only sixteen when he was
appointed municipal teacher with a
salary of ₱15 (Mer ga month. Aftel
ths as mad


he switched in June, 1909, to the
office of the then bureau of audits
as district auditor’s clerk in the
province of Tayabas.
“I consider that the turning point
of my life,” the deputy auditor gen¬
eral said. "And it all came out by
accident. During the celebration
of my wedding on May 23, 1909,
one of those present was the then
Tayabas District Auditor Joseph
A. Stiver. Mrs. Stiver was teach¬
ing in the high school which was
housed in the same building where
I was teaching as an intermediate

school teacher.
“Mr. Stiver had learned that I
was a first grade civil service elig¬
ible besides being an insular teach¬
er. During the wedding, Mr. Sti¬
ver apprised me of a vacancy in his
office at Lucena, and offered me
the position, saying I was to re¬
ceive twenty pesos more than what
I was getting as a teacher. I ac¬
cepted the position on the spot.”
In June, 1914, he was appointed
deputy district auditor for Laguna.

his superiors that he was elevated
to the position of district auditor
in 1916. He discharged the duties
of this position in several provinces
including Manila.
Again he was promoted, this
time to the chair of assistant man¬
ager of the department of provin¬
cial and municipal audits in 1918
From there he was further elevated
to the post of assistant manager of
the department of insular audits in
1921. He came to Manila and also
studied nights in the Philippine
Law School. He continued display¬
ing such efficient service
that he was pushed up seve¬
ral rungs more: manager of
the department of statistics
of the bureau of audits
1925), manager of the de-
partment of provincial and
municipal audits (1931). It
was this post which he re¬
cently vacated. He graduat¬
ed from the Philippine Law
School in 1926 and passed
the bar examinations the
same year. Among his co¬
graduates is Auditor Gene¬
ral Jaime Hernandez. When
he was still in the province
he had a correspondence
course with the La Salle
Extension University of
Chicago, obtaining his cer¬
tificate as certified public
accountant in 1923.
He had at various times
been designated by former
Governor-General Murphy
to investigate the business
affairs and administrations
of several private corpora¬
tions. He assisted in the
auditing and investigation
of the accounts of the Phil¬
ippine National Bank and
the Manila Railroad Com¬
pany. In 1924 he was chair¬
man of the committee that
investigated various offi¬

Mr. Agregado is a very loving y
busy man and has no time for hob¬

“Not unless you calm down and
intil you have played basketball

Tony glared at our beaming fa¬

roing with you. I’ll show you how
o basket that ball."
"Now you are using your head,”" I

caution him to be careful not to
throw the racket.
When we arrived at the court in
the elementary school grounds, To¬
ny wanted to know how we could
play basketball when there were
only three of us.
“Just step in there and shoot,"
Joe told him over a shoulder as he
ran to the schoolhouse to hide the
racket.
But Tony did not step in there
and shoot. Even while Joe and I
were running, throwing, shouting,
he stood in the shade near the court
Only when we passed the ball to him
did he try to locate the basket. He
laughed when Joe slipped and
skinned his knee. Once in a while
he would shout, "Double dribbling,

FT was winter, almost spring,
and the black city ice was be¬
ginning to thaw. It was a
stery how we lived through that
nter. Every day two of us went
town. Joe was tall and hand¬
ne and had an overcoat of his
n. A real winter overcoat.
Jehnny had none, so he alternated
th Joe. Nominally I had one too,
a tan camel’s hair topcoat, polo
tyle, a relic of more prosperous
days. It still had its smart, dash-
g lines, but a fellow couldn’t look
ashing in a thin topcoat, when the
hermometer hugged its base down
 the five- or ten-below-zero level.

lands.
Pedro (Pete) was my height, al¬
ough a little stouter, so he could
ear the topcoat. I was always

toulders when he wore it. Pas¬

We had paid for the lignt-u-
eping apartment for two months
advance, when the boys, Pete and
e, came in from the country
here they had been working at the
innesota sugar beet farms. That
as in October. We managed to
y the rent in December and part
that for January. Now the jan¬
or, who was also collecting rent
ad been very patient with us.
iess he liked us, that John Hein¬
ch. He used to invite us into his
sement apartment for home-brew
id we’d take down our guitars and
suleles and play and sing far into
e night.
It was almost spring, but it was
ll bitter cold. Our combined
nds had shrunk to almost noth¬
g. One day we had only soda
ickers and water. But even that
nt the way of all food.
Then we ran into a bit of luck.
e almost got into trouble, though.
e went to an amusement parlor
Hennepin and Eighth. The
nagement, to drum up business,
is holding a billiard tournament
th a prize of five dollars for the
nning pair. There was an en¬
ince fee of a dime for all compet¬


tween us. That meant a hambur¬
ger sandwich for each of us. That
would have been the luxurious end
of our funds, for hamburgers cost
a nickel apiece. We were down to
cur last quarter.
"I’ve got a hunch, Joe said. “I
think I can lick all these guys here
tonight. You join in too. You nev.
er can tell."
But I was for saving the money.
So we compromised by my buying
a dozen doughnuts and Joe entering
the tournament. By a series of
miracles he reached the finals.
He was paired with an Italian
against a Negro and a Norwegian.
The Negro broke and ran in the
8-ball, the I-ball, made a combina¬
tion shot, and sank the 5-ball. The
Italian took in the 2-ball and the
10-ball. The Norwegian bid fair
to bring them all in. He was not


stop, however, after bagging the
13-ball. There were now the 14-
15- 12- and 9-balls left for Joe.
He must have been feeling good.
He took them in short order and
his side won with but two points
to spare. Joe and the Italian de¬
cided to split the winnings.
“Let’s have a sandwich and cof¬
fee,” Joe said, as he handed me two
dollars. I was property custodian,
you know. "How about a show?”
“Nah! You’re crazy. Those boys
there are still hungry."
“All right then, you go ahead.
Ill come home later.”
T was dim between street cor¬
ners, especially down towards
I
the southern part of the town-
around Eighth Avenue and Seventh
Street. Around there anyway. Joe
had decided against going to the


boys instead. He was coming home
A slim girl walked past him an
brushed her fur-trimmed shoulder
against Joe. Ever so lightly. The
she looked over her shoulder an
slowed down!
Joe was not dumb. He knew the
signs. But this one was different
She didn’t have the poise, the prop
er technic of approach.
“Where’s the fire?” he greeted.
“I don’t know, do you?” He
voice was queer, and betrayed a
attempt at being hard.
“Sure, I do,” he said. “But I hav
only fifty cents for the show!”

hand on his arm. "A buck and

VER one of the college halls
at Oxford University hung
an expectant silence. The
fifty freshmen gathered on the hard
benches for the induction ceremony
realized that the Principal was
about to arise. They sat stiff and
self-conscious, timidly glancing
about at the gilt-framed portraits
on the walls or looking straight
ahead toward the dais at the front.
On this platform, a few steps above
the main floor, sat a row of gowned
men behind the heavy oak table.
These—actually in the flesh—were
the dons that the freshmen had
heard about; and in the center, be¬
low the intricate coat-of-arms, was
the most venerable of the group, the
Principal, whose scholarly bearing
befitted this somber medieval hall.
One of the new students—he
seemed slightly detached—had a
more mature cast of eye than the
eighteen year olds about him. The
rims of his glasses were heavier and
darker and his clothes had a broad,
un-English cut. He glanced about
furtively and the trace of a smile
gathered at the corners of his
mouth. He was contrasting this so¬
lemn scene with that at an Amer¬
ican college. There you waited your
turn in the hubbub of your ad¬
viser’s office and later filed hur¬
riedly past a registrar’s clerk-girl
who whisked papers about in a
wicker wire booth.
This student recalled his first
American college, where he had got
his B. A.—a denominational insti¬
tution in a little lowa town. It was
a small school, but he had some true
friends on the faculty. Then at the
age of twenty-one he had gone up
to the State University for a year
and got a master’s degree in his¬
tory. He had enjoyed the work and
his adviser had liked his thesis. He
had proved that the early lowa set-
tlers were largely Southerners, and
that ten years before the Civil War
lowa would have sided with the
Southern cause. His biggest ordeal
of the year had been trying out for
the Rhodes scholarship to come to
Oxford University and he had trem¬
bled before the examining commit¬
tee. But after a long discussion
they had called in the candidates
and announced their decision: “Mr.
Ross.” Now Mr. Ross, a freshman
again, was starting out at Oxford,
waiting for the induction ceremony.
He sniffed at the faint sour smell
of beer that hung over the room.
He would learn later of sconces and
convivial “bump suppers.”
His eves and those of all others


tion, of course. He could force
himself to say “Heah” if he wanted
to.
But he was an American.
“Mr. Edmonds.” “Heah."
And a Middle-Westerner at that.
“Mr. Farrell.” “Heah.”
As the steady march continued,
the muscles in his shoulders tensed.
The r’s would come along now in a
matter of minutes, and he would
have to decide one way or the oth-
er. He loved the Middle West. Peo¬
ple seldom talked about it, but he
knew that he did. He remembered
his flare of wrath upon reading an
article in a big magazine by a man
from the Rockies who said that the
prairie was monotonous and no one
could love it. Why, the prairie was
something you could bathe yourself
in.
He remebered a certain afternoon
during his high school years when
the feeling had taken hold of him
possessively. He had driven out
with his mother from their town
home to the farm she had inherited.
As she talked about the place with
the renter, the son had climbed to
the rear door of the haymow that
overlooked the fields beyond. The
summer’s heat held the corn rows
in a gelatinous silence and pressed
so heavily on the crumbly loam that
a soil-whiff rolled up and sent a
twinge deep in his throat. These
fruity undulations of prairie made
a homeland. In cultivating these
fields here—
“Mr. Hassall.” “Heah.”
—his grandfather had spent his
life. The boy had thought of his


in the room converged upon the
Principal as the aged man put his
hands on the carved arms of the
chair and lifted himself up. The
long, swinging sleeves of his black
academic gown gave his figure a
sort of regality. He smiled in a
grandfatherly way and squinted as
if the dim light hurt his eyes.
His informal words of greeting
had a smoothness that made them
seem perfunctory. For many years,
probably, they had welcomed each
new freshman group. "You will
first read this Latin oath, placing
your hand on the Bible,” he intoned
"and then sign your name in the
Buttery Book.” He nodded toward
the Vice-Principal, who sat at the
end of the table with a double-sized
ledger in front of him. "You will
then be full members of this an-
cient and honorable college. Now .
shall call the roll of candidates for
admission to membership."
From the paper in his hand he
began reading the names alphabet¬
ically: “Mr. Adock.”
The word "Present” came shaki¬
ly from a freshman off at the side,
and every one turned to look at
him.
“Mr. Alford.”
The answer was a guttural syl-
lable probably meant to be “Here.”
“Mr. Arnold.”


This was a man with self-assur-
ance. He might become president
of the debating society before he
left college. With a soft-turned
modulation he enunciated, "Heah.”
His answer seemed to give courage
to those who followed.
“Mr. Bartlett.” “Heah.”
“Mr. Broadhead.” “Heah.”
The lowa Rhodes scholar noticed
that they used the kind of “r” that
he called “Eastum.” He affected it
jocularly when he put a note-book
ring to his eve for a monocie and
But
pretended to have “cultuah.”
it seemed to come natural to them.
Probably it did come natural. His
own “r,” he reflected, was actually
pronounced in a word.
There was a long list of e’s, about
a dozen, and the answer came with
regularity. “Heah.” “Heah.” “He¬
ah.” “Heah."
With a squirm of the tongue he
formed the word as he pronounced
it: “He-er.” How outlandish it
would sound in this group, he real¬
ized.
“Mr. Dallam.” “Heah.”
“Mr. Dunsworth.” “Heah.”
The Rhodes scholar edged for¬
ward on the hard bench and a sort
of panic came over him. Why, he
couldn’t flout this whole group of
people, this whole University. He'd

TAKE IT EASY
By WALTER B. PITKIN
 MOTIONS, attitudes, and
feelings are explosives. The
E explosion may be violent
and marked to any observer, as
when you “lose control of your¬
self” in a fit of rage. Or it may
be violent only within your body
while outwardly you are poised
and calm. We appraise an emo¬
ion as good if it relaxes us or
prevents us from growing tense.
Grief, for instance, is surely un.
pleasant, as a rule; yet we all
know the benefits of "a good cry."
The commonest evil result of
strong emotions develops somewhere
in the digestive tract. Sometimes
the throat goes horribly tense.
Again it is the stomach which tight
ens up so badly that it cannot per¬
form the digestive movements. It
may be even the colon, whose spasms
bring on constipation and ulcers and
appendicitis. Such disasters are
never brought on by a single emo¬
tional shock that passes after a few
minutes. They come only after many
prolonged tensions of fear, worry
or anger have set up a habit in the
muscles.
Stomach ulcers which have been
caused by tensions induced by worry
can often be cured by relaxing. Re¬
cently four Columbia University
professors reported that 32 such
sufferers recovered after listening
to lectures by a psychologist on ten¬
sions and relaxing. At the end of
each lecture the listeners drank cold
water. That was the entire treat¬
ment. At the end of six weeks all
but two were eating whatever they
- Dr. Albert J Sullivan of the


Yale University School of Medicine
believes that emotional disturbances
cause three-quarters of the cases of
ulcerative colitis. There occurs a
sort of digestive self-cannibalism.
Emotions sometimes over-stimulate
the digestive tract, which in turn
becomes so hyperactive that it be
gins to digest its own surface. Dr.
Sullivan recently reported that re-
lief from worry had cured patients
of this malady, "as if by magic,”
after all known medical means had
failed.

Toyeries
EEN years ago, when Ida Cash
began working as Probation
Officer in the Children’s
Court of New York City, she was
appalled at the number of children
arrested for stealing playthings. It
seemed to her that poor children
should be able to get toys without
having to pay for them with a court
record. She hit upon the idea of
establishing a “toyery,” where free
playthings could be lent to children
the way books are in a library. The
world’s first toyery was opened at
New York University’s community
center. In establishing it, Mrs.
Cash spent her summer vacation
getting people to donate toys.
Neighborhood boys and young men,
potential delinquents, take great
pride in the work of painting and
repairing toys that come in much
the worse for wear Volunteers
sterilize the toys before they go out.
Established first in 1933, there are
now four toyeries in New York, and
a central organization which pro¬
vides help and information for those
who are interested in establishing
toyeries in other cities.

Last year, a young man began to
notice a strange weakening of his
muscles. They looked as big and
strong as ever, but they became so
impotent he could not do even the
lightest work. Finally, his arm
muscles and jaw muscles grew so
weak he was unable to lift food to
his mouth or to chew solids.
Puzzled physicians called in spe¬
cialists. They diagnosed the trou¬
ble as a rare disease known as
myasthenia gravis. In it, the
muscles retain their outward ap-
pearance of vigor but do not res¬
pond normally to the messages re¬
layed from the brain.
On the south coast of Ireland, a
few years ago, an even queerer case
baffled doctors for several weeks.
One Thursday morning, a small boy
in Fivemiletown, County Tyrone.
came down with a high fever. By
afternoon, it reached 105 degrees.
The next day, his temperature had
subsided. But, exactly one week
later, the fever returned, ran its
one-day course, and again sub¬
sided. Week after week, as Thurs-
day morning came, the child de¬
veloped a burning fever that rose
to 104 or 105 degrees before the
day was over. The rest of the week,
his temperature was nearly nor-

YUITE by accident New Zeal¬
anders have discovered a new
use for hair of a platinum shade.
An angler, fishing near Canterbury,
was forced to tie one of his flies
with a few strands of blonde hair
from a friend. His catch was phe¬
nomenal, so he experimented and
found it has an irresistible attrac-
tion for certain kinds of fish. The
craze has spread, and young chil¬
dren who possess platinum hair are
having their locks sheared and sold
to anglers for anything from five
to twenty-five shillings a ringlet,
the price depending upon the pale¬
ness of colour and the quality of
the hair.

debates as to the cause of the
strange disorder. Then a Belfast
patholegist studied a drop of the
boy’s blood under a high-powered
microscope and was able to put his
finger upon the curious solution of
the baffling mystery.
A few weeks before his first at¬
tack of fever the boy had been
nipped on one foot by a rat caught
in a trap. He was suffering from
a rare disease known in the Orient
as rat-bite fever.
Another rare infection from the
Orient recently traveled to Passaic,
N. J. It came on the blade of a
Malay creese, or serpentine-bladed
dagger. A returning traveler
brought the weapon from a temple
in Bali as a present for his four¬
teen-year-old grandson. On the
first day, the boy scratched his leg
with the tip of the blade. Almost
immediately, a mysterious infection
of a rare gas-producing germ be¬
gan to act. The leg swelled as
though it were being inflated with
a bicycle pump. Only quick work
and special treatment at the hos-
pital enabled doctors to conquer the
mysterious trouble.
On a number of occasions, pa¬
tients have had their whole bodies
swell up like balloons. One in¬
stance of the kind occurred at Port¬
land, Ore., only a few weeks ago.
In an automobile crash, a man in¬
jured his frontal sinus, the cavity
above and behind the eyebrows. Air
breathed through the nose filtered
into the body under the skin. Enor¬
mously elastic, the skin stretched
until the man was twice normal
size, and his neck was puffed out
until his chin had disappeared.
Actually afraid their patient would
swell up until he burst, the doctors
punctured him with hollow needles
and let him shrink back to normal
proportions while they treated the
damaged sinus.
The strangest poisoning case re¬
ported in recent years, caused the
death of Sergeant John Wolfe of
the Boston. Mass., police force. In
line of duty, Sergeant Wolfe had
survived heing bitten by a cat, a
dog, and an intoxicated man. Then,

In Defense Of lloilo Sakdals
With respect to the article "Sak¬
dal Movement Bared in Iloilo" in
the Dec. 26th issue of  ,
after a talk which I had with the
officers of the said party, two of
the officers of the party, Mr. Ri¬
cardo Gangoso and Francisco Jamo¬
langue, Jr., said that the writer of
the said article must have been
dreaming the moment he wrote the
article.
Mr. Miraflor, writer of the said
article, had really not interviewed
the chief of police of La Paz, Mr.
Dionisio Cordova. Mr. Miraflor
submitted the wrong picture. Ac¬
cording to Mr. Jamolangue, Jr.,
they were not photographed at the
time they were investigated by the
authorities with respect to the
movement of their party.
According to Mr. Miraflor the of-
ficers of the party are men of very
limited schooling, some having
reached aly the intermediate
grades and the rest had finished
the primary grades. This statement
of Mr. Miraflor, according to Mr.
Gangoso, the president of the par¬
ty, is untrue.
Mr. R. Gangoso is not only a
man of education but also a man of
means. He is a real philanthropist
both in spirit and in action. The
people of Mandurriao as well as
Jordan can testify as to the truth
of this assertion.

If
IF you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same:
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools;
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!”
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,

Pro Garcia Villa
I am sending a couple of bouquets
of fresh native gardenia (rosal to
you) to Jose Garcia Villa for his
splendid installments recently pub¬
lished in your magazine and to Es¬
trella D. Alfon for her unusually
beautiful story, “Home Before the
Journey,” which, I have no doubt,
has made a lot of people sniff.
Personally, I like Jose Garcia
Villa as a short story writer and
constructive critic. It is only a
pity he seldom writes for local ma¬
gazines.
Regarding Miss Estrella Alfon,
her latest short story, I believe, is
her best so far.

More On Villa
Many would think that Villa is
the biggest fish in Philippine liter¬
ature, and all the rest are little
fishes. This, at least, is what
Villa would make us think of him.
Mr. Villa’s supreme devotion to his
modern art, to the exclusion of all
other spirits and conceptions of
art, is very unfortunate and is an
unhappy testimony of his littleness
and ignorance. Ne doubt, he is, as
I have often believed, coming
acioss some of his fine works, a
genius; that is, one with an infinite
capacity to take pains. But as a
critic, he a literary bigot, or else
he is an unhappy picture of his art,
as vague as his literary methods
are vague.
Now this does not mean that we
do not understand Villa’s poetry, or
that we have “fogged brains," as
F Araullo remarked. We have
read most of Villa’s poetry and
other literary effusions, and, in the
sanctuaries of our little minds, we
know the little place where we
must put him. Anyway, it does not
require all the stretch of imagin-
ation to understand Villa. A little
search between his lines readily
shows that he has written the most
horrible things in the country, hor¬
rible to the delicate and fine taste
of the conservative spirit.
He has invented his own method
not that he is a superior genius,

should be plain, he e covered with bad
designs; a wall the .uld support only one
well cheses picture is covered with five. Cur-
taias, wans, lones, furniture, all fight with one
another erying, "Look at me! Look at me!”
Tarniture for the living room should be
for use, simple in line, and honest in construc¬
tion. Every piece should first be useful, then
decorative. Pretty little chairs that really are
neither comfortable nor built upon enduring
lines have no place in any living room. Stiff,
hard-seated sofas that do not invite repose
should be frowned upon. If possible, avoid sets
of furniture. They give a set appearance to
the average living room.
In small rooms, the secret of gaining the
appearance of greater space than really exists
is keeping the large pieces of furniture against
the walls and having them follow the main lines


of the room. A long sofa cutting the corner of
a room or a rug laid diagonally across the floor
reduces the apparent size of the largest room
and such placement has no reason anyway.
How useless is a table stranded in the cen¬
ter of a room! With the chairs scattered about
the room, there seems to be no apparent relation
between them and the lone table. How much
more interesting and convenient the arrange¬
ment would be if the table and the chairs were
grouped together.
This brings out this question: What is the
first law of furniture arrangement?
According to an eminent New York interior
decorator, condensed into one word, she would
say comfort. If we attain this, a room cannot
fail to have good arrangement.
Perhaps, she says, the most vital principle
of successful furniture arrangement is also the
most obvious: the need for planning furniture
groups naturally so that persons using a room
may be sociable as well as comfortable without
having to change the arrangement of the pieces
of furniture. Place your furniture where they
are needed and you will be sure to have an ideal
furniture arrangement.
First and foremost, we decide what func-
tion the room is to perform. Is it a living
room, a gathering place for the entire family?
And of what does the family consist of? What
is the chief interest of each? These determined,
we give a thought to where each mem¬
ber can sit most comfortably and happily to
indulge in what activity he likes best, both at
night and in the day. Immediately we place chairs
by sources of light—windows and lamps—with
accompanying tables to hold books, ash trays,
flower bowls, and other small articles. Then
we must think of the guest and see to it that


there is a place that invites the visitor to s-
where conversation may be easy and natura
This means a grouping of two or more seat.
For such a group, a sofa and two chairs an
a low table are ideal. This provides a pleasan
group for entertaining callers and, with a lamp
able for evening reading. The larg

chosen pictures will add com ana netctelion a

in most cases, increases rather than detract
from the charm of a room.
Simpliciy and restraint should both be ok
served most carefully in the planning and mak
ing of curtains for the living room. The rang
of materials is unlimited, from charmin
and inexpensive printed cottons to costly silk:
Very few people are aware of the neani
charm, and utility of unbleached muslin for cu¬
tains. It washes well, has good body, can b
dyed any color, and is most inexpensive. Plai
curtains that hang in straight folds or in shi
rings from rods down to the window sills o
floor are indicative of better taste than b
ruffled, tied-with-bows or scalloped ones.
FOR PRESERVING FLOWERS
An old method practised in New Englan
for the preservation of cut flowers is to mou
them in a good-sized potato, cucumber, beet,
any other solid vegetable. A sharp lead pen
cil or pointed instrument is used to punch ore
hole in the vegetable for each flower stem, which
is inserted therein. The whole is then set
a vase with water sufficiently deep to cover tl
base of the stems. It is said that flowers w¬
keep twice as long as usual when this metho
is employed.

What lo Eat


(According To Dr. Jean Bogert, noted
French nutrition expert.)
If You Are Of The Stocky Type
Plenty of milk, cream, and butter; whole¬
wheat bread; cereals; vegetables, well-cCoked,
not too harsh-fibered; fruits (emove skins
and seeds if these cause trouble); cream
soups and purees; cIstards, puddings, ice¬
nts of meat, eggs, cheese,
of harsh and fibrous vege¬
sufficiently cooked cereals;
Slavies.
f You Are Of The Slender Type
Plenty of milk, vegetables, especially of
the leafy and fibrous kind; little of starchy
vegetables, such as potatoes; plenty of fruits,
except the dried ones; clear soups.
Moderate amounts of meat, eggs, and
cheese.
Small amounts of starchy foods, sweets,
and desserts with low fuel value.
Eat sparingly of butter, cream, salad
dressings, fatty meats, bread, potatoes,
cereals, sweets, and rich desserts.


EHERE is a theoretical normal in weight
and build, but it is a rare person indeed
who conforms perfectly to it. Some of
us are inclined to be slender; others to be
stocky; and quite a few of us are downright
lank and lean or short and fat. The slender
ones may weigh 109% less than the theoretical
normal for their height without being really un-
derweight; and stockily built people may exceed
theirs by as much as 159% or 20% without det¬
riment to their health. But neither the fat nor
the lean should let their variations exceed this
range. No amount of dieting, however, will
convert a stocky person into a sylph, or make a
tall, lean person really fat. You can’t alter hu¬
man structure by dieting any more than you can
change a greyhound into a bulldog by overfeed¬
ing.
Differences in temperament account in a
large part for the tendencies to put on or lose
fat. Tall, slender people are usually active,
high-strung neryonely, and they fatigue easily.
With such a temperament, they are apt to burn
up any extra extra supply of food material tak¬
en, and so it is difficult to put on flesh on
their bones, even by overfeeding. Not only
that, but they have a short, highly active intes¬
tinal tract which may hurry food through the
body before it is completely absorbed. This
makes it doubly difficult to fatten them.
The fat ones are apt to be less active, both
physically and mentally. This makes them burn
less fuel foods, so there is a surplus stored as
fat. They take on weight too readily, and their
long, slow-moving intestines retain food until
the nutriment is digested and absorbed.
Feeding The Lean
If you are lean, keep to a diet of highly
nutritious, non-irritating foods. Fruits and
vegetables are essential, too, but harsh-fibered
ones should be softened by cooking and eaten
in smaller amounts. Do not over-indulge in
sweets and fatty foods. If you cannot eat
enough at each meal, have five small meals
each day—breakfast, mid-lunch, lunch, merien¬
da, and supper. This egg whip, taken with


every meal or between meals and before retir¬
ing in the evening, will help to add from two to
three pounds of weight weekly, many physi¬
cians have found by experience:
Whip one egg thoroughly until it looks
creamed. It should almost fill a glass. Add one
cup of milk. Sweeten to taste.
Here is another fattening drink: Strain the
juice of one orange into a g.ass. Add 1 cup of
milk and one beaten egg. Sweeten to taste.
Feeding The Fat
If you are fat, your diet should be more
scanty and should consist chiefly of foods which
are bulky, coarse-fibered, and of low fuel value.
Concentrate on foods which contain a good deal
of water or of fiber, or both. Vegetables are
especially suitable, except the starchy ones, like
potatoes, peas, corn, and beans, which should
be taken in small amounts only. You can in¬
dulge with a free conscience, though, in those
vegetables like lettuce, spinach, asparagus, and
turnips. Fruits are apt to have a higher fuel
value because they contain some sugar, dried
fruits particularly. Use extreme caution in
eating starchy foods and sweets and above all,
eat sparingly of fried foods. Clear soups and
beverages without cream or sugar may be used
freely. Salads are the foods that are highly
suitable to the stout. They are filling and low
in fuel value, if just a small amount of salad
dressing is used.

w AIR styles change frequent¬
ly, but when you have
IA found one that suits your
face or your personality, stick to
it and modify it only slightly to
fit the prevailing mode.
A change in one’s hair comb
changes one’s appearance complete¬
ly, for the better or for the worse,
so go about changing your coiffure
slowly and carefully. Do not imitate
the hairdress that looks well on
somebody because it may not look
well on you. And unless you have
plenty of time and money to spend
on your hair, do not affect an in¬
tricate coiffure. Many a girl who
has had her hair cut and curled to
save time finds that she spends
more time fixing it in the morning
than when it was long and straight.
The reason is that the coiffure is
of the type that requires too much
attention—as when it consists of lit-
tle curls at the nape of the neck that
must be rolled one by one every
morning. If you are planning to
have your hair cut and curled,
don’t let the beauty shop operator
bully you into affecting a hair style
that is either unsuitable to your
face or intricate.
Your coiffure should suit the type
or shape of your face. Faces may
be divided, according to their shapes,
into the oval-shaped, which is con¬
sidered the regular shape of the
face, round and broad, thin and
long, and square-jawed. Fortun¬
ately there is at least a movie star
whose face typifies each classifica¬
tion whom we may give as an exam¬
ple. As the coiffures of movie ac¬
tresses are chosen carefully with
the aid of specialists, we can profit
much from their examples.
Sylvia Sidney whose face is a per¬
atudio
fect oval is considered h
cameramen in Hollywood
vie actress whose face
graphically perfect. Hers
type of face that can look lovely
with any kind of coiffure. It takes
a perfect face like hers to look beau¬
tiful with such a severe coiffure as
is shown on this page. The mid-
dle part with the hair drawn severe¬
ly from the face is fatal to most
women, but Sylvia Sidney’s face can
stand it. A woman with a face like
hers—perfect oval, regular features
—does not have any hair-style
worry.
Is Your Face Round?
Avoid the center part because it

irregular features. If only the tips
of the ears are exposed, the neck
and face will seem longer. Avoid
very short hair or a plastered coif-
fure, for either tends to make a
broad face look broader.
Is Your Face Long And Thin?
If your face is long and tends to
be thin, but your features are reg¬
ular, the center part with the hair
drawn back to reveal the face is
the ideal coiffure for you. Jean¬
ette MacDonald, popular screen act¬
ress, favors a part that is slightly
to one side of the center with the

adds width to the appearance or
face. A side part, perpendicular to
one of the eyebrows or lower, with
the hair combed away from the
forehead and then brought down at
the temples to cover the sides of the
face will give the appearance of
greater length to a broad face.
Hair combed off the forehead and
piled high on the head adds greaten
length to the face, but also reveals


loosely waved hair partly covering
the forehead, thus making the long
face look shorter.
Bangs covering the forehead,
hair worn low on the forehead, or
ears entirely exposed give the ap-
pearance of width to a narrow face.
Hair completely covering the ears
and partially covering the neck
makes the face and the neck look

Young who have long faces an¬

Constance Bennett who has
square jaw affects a very low sid

completely and also the jaws.
Irregular Features
Consider your hairdress from th-
front, sides, and back. The lengti
of the hair and the placement of th
knot or coil (if the hair is long
have a tremendous infiuence upo
the features. One reason why thin
ning out the hair at the back of th
head has become popular is tha
when the hair follows the natura
shape of the head, the features ap
pear in best proportion.
A knot or arcoil placed at the le
vel of the nose or the chin calls at
tention to this feature. The cente
part is most unbecoming to a wom
an with close set or small eyes, espe¬
cially if her hair is straight. I-
the forehead is high or very wid
and prominent, wear the hair loy
over it or wear bangs. On the oth
er hand, if the brow is narrow an
low, the hair should be combe
back from it.
Emphasizing Features
There are, however, feature;
that should be emphasized insteac
of hidden. For instance, Carole
Lombard who has a beautiful fore¬
head does not cover it with bangs
or with curls. Instead she blatant
ly exposes it by combing her hail
from it. Kay Francis who has a de
cided widow’s peak, plays it up
whatever hair style she adopts
Norma Shearer reveals her perfeci
hairline by combing her hair, which
is always straight about two or
more inches from the hairline, from
her forehead.
The most fetching coiffure to the
great majority of women is the one
il ustrated by Mary Boland. The
hair is parted at the side and then

ears are covered.

How You May Change
Your Complexionl
Any woman not satisfied with her com¬
plexion can easily ramove it and have a new
one. The thin veil of stifling half-dead
cuticle is an encumbrance and should be re¬
moved to give the fresh, vigorous, young
skin underneath a chance to show itself and
to breathe. Mercolized Wax is a simple re¬
medy which will always do the work from
your druggist and apply it at night like cold
cream, washing it off in the morning. Mer¬
colizad Wax will gently absorh all the I’fe¬
less skin and leave a healthy and beautiful
complexion. Mercolized Wax is pleasant to
use, and econemical. Mercolized Wax brings
out the hidden beauty of your skin.

Above are the twelve Filipino society girls who attended the Benedictine school
for girls in Tutzing, Bavaria, photegraphed on the steps of the home economics
building there. (Courtesy, Misses Salud and Margarita Hocson)


TEWELVE society girls from
the Philippines, some of
whom had never, perhaps,
wielded a broom before, cooked,
swept the floor, washed dishes,
made their own beds, laundered
most of their clothes, and used
their feet for transportation most
of the time, for a year. The
amazing thing about it is that
these girls loved to do all these
things and many others, such as
picking fruits and gardening dur¬

ing the summer, filling the fur-
nace with coal during the winter.
They even paid for the privilege of
learning how to do them properly.
These girls, all prominent in Ma¬
nila’s social circles, were Charito
Lobregat (who became Mrs. Jose
Legarda only recently), Carmen
Eguaras, Carmen Barredo (presid¬
ent of the Rho Alpha at the time
of her departure for abroad), Ele¬
na, Lucia (who became Mrs. Jose
Valladolid only the other week),
and Paquita Villareal, Rosalinda
Claudio, Isabel Lorenzo, Maria
Angela Ansaldo, the two Hocson
sisters, Salud and Margarita, and
Macaria Tinio, who specialized in
home economics in the Benedictine
school for girls in Tutzing, Bava¬
ria, for a year, and then traveled
in Europe before returning to the
Philippines.
The twelve girls left the Philip-
pines in two groups, each group be¬
ing chaperoned by a Sister from
the St. Scholastica College here.
The first group consisting of the
first six girls mentioned above left
a year earlier than the second
group and came back about a year
earlier too. Macaria Tinio is the
only one now remaining in Europe
and she has transferred to another
school in Switzerland. These twelve
girls, then, have the distinction of
composing the largest group of Fi¬
lipino girls enrolled in one school
at the same time.
The chief purpose of the girls,
most of whom are high school
graduates from the Benedictine
school for girls in Manila, for go¬
ing broad was travel, but they de-
cided to study home economics in
the Benedictine school for girls in
Bavaria first because they had


Twelve Manila Society

heard so much about it. More¬
over, they were told that they could
travel, under the chaperonage of
one of the Sisters of the school,
during the long holidays and sum¬
mer vacations, which they did.
The German housewives have
long been famous throughout Eu¬
rope and even abroad for their in¬
dustry and thrift and the Filipino
girls learned to be industrious and
thrifty from the home economics
course that they took. Order and
cleanliness, says the Misses Salud
and Margarita Hocson, two of the
girls who have just arrived, are
two of the virtues observed in even
the poorest of German homes, and
these can be accomplished only
with industry. The German house¬
wife is never idle; if she is not
cooking or cleaning the house or
washing clothes, she is either knit¬
ting or doing some kind of fine
needlework. Even when she goes
visiting, she takes along her sew¬
ing or her knitting so that her fin
gers can be busy while she ta’ks.
The daughters in a German family
help their mother in her household
duties from a tender age, thus,
when they marry, they are al¬
ready experienced housekeepers and
cooks.
The students in the Benedictine
school for girls in Bavaria who are
specializing in home economics live


in a house by themselves and do all
the cooking, house-cleaning, wash-
ing, and even tending the furnace
during winter, without the help of
a servant. These students are di¬
vided into groups, each group be¬
ing assigned a special task each
week. In addition to these duties
assigned to groups, there are also
those that each girl has to do for
herself, such as making her own
bed, mending her clothes, and tak¬
ing care of her own things.
The school which these girls at¬
tended is located in a village where
the people lead almost the same
kind of life they led centuries ago.
The girls were surprised to realize
after a few months in the place
that they could get along without
dances, movies, or the company of
the members of the strong sex for
their entertainment. Not that go¬
ing out to dances, to cafes or the
movies alone with young men is
taboo in Germany, but hiking is the
favorite pastime of the young folk,
as well as of the old, who walk for
miles, sometimes for days, carry¬

their clothes in packs on their
backs. At first the Filipino girls,
the Misses Hocson confessed, walked
only for a mile, resting frequently,

went mountain-climbing with them.
Germany is the place where
plumpness is fashionable among
women, at least in those parts of
the country, as in Bavaria, where
outside influences have not as yet
greatly altered the mode of living
of the inhabitants. The German
people are healthy and the women
are strong. The Misses Hocson
tell that it is not unusual to see
women in German villages or in
rural districts carrying heavy loads
on their backs or on their heads.
The women look beautiful in a
healthy way—their faces a glow-
ing pink, their eyes blue, and their
hair flaxen. Much of the health
of these people are due to simple
living in the open air.
The German girls are sports¬
minded and indulge in all kinds of
outdoor sports, such as canoeing,
sleighing, and skiing with profi¬
ciency. Although German girls in
the cities have become modernized,
taking up careers and competing
with men in all fields of business
and in the professions, those who
live in the villages are still old¬
fashioned in the sense that they are
content to get married and settle
down, raising a large family and
becoming more and more buxom,
just as their mothers and the
mothers of their mothers were.

LETTERS TO YE EDITOR

but because he is a failure in other
methods. At best, his poetry is
only lines. The fact that Villa
knows a way of writing his own
art, does not mean that all other
al as de¬
fined by a Fiench ernic, is ble re


construction of consciousness in ref¬
erence to the whole of experience,
then any piece of art that is the
real art, must necessarily be both
old and modern. For the whole ex-
perience, psychologically speaking,
is a process of centuries.
Both Mr. J. G. Villa and Mr. C.
Faigao stand on opposite sides of


art. However, it is apparent that
Mr Faigao is the lesser bigot.
One peculiar thing about the
Villa list of short stories is that the
honor writers are not exactly like
Villa. Take Messrs. Arguilla, Ica¬
siano, Pedroche, the Misses Paras
and Pestano, and many others.
Which means that Villa is gradually


coming to himself.

Shameful? Very!
Rather shameful but Dumanjug,
Cebu, for lack of unity and coope¬
ration, deliberately forgot to com¬
memorate Rizal Day.
Here lies the trouble: Everyone
wanted to lead, nobody wanted to
follow nobody felt capable of lead¬
ing. Many of us had wanted to
celebrate the day, but the town of¬
ficials did not seem interested
about Rizal Day; instead they de-
voted their time to preparing a re¬
ligious program. Which we did
not want. So nothing was done
about anything.

Guimbal Up In Arms
I, a Guimbaleno and active wit¬
ness of all the civic and social act¬
ivities in Guimbal, my town, don’t
agree with Mr. Agustin Garinga¬
lao’s opinion that Guimbal girls
are fond of dancing as he had said
on this page in a recent  
issue.
Yes, when the S.N.A. Alumni
Association held their benefit ball
many Guimbal girls witnessed the
coronation ceremonies but they did
not dance afterwards. Why? Be¬
cause they are devoted Catholics.
They prefer the church and the
masses to the gaiety of the ball¬
room. Proof, the young womenfolic
are devotees of several or anyone ef
the following: Siete Virtudes, Lo
des, Inmaculada Concepcion, Cr¬
men, Sta. Teresita de Jesus, Santo
Rosario. The majority of the girls
are members of Hijas de Maria.

MYSTERIOUS DISEASES

septic poisoning!
Another class of stranger-than-
fiction ailments are those which
cause changes in the color of skins
and body tissues. Legs that turn
blve, eyeballs that become perma¬
nently black, skins that shift their
bue to purple, green, yellow, red,
black, and brown—are all known to
the medical world.
A woman with a rainbow skin,
which changed its hue four times in
a single week, recently astonished
doctors' at a Kansas City, Mo., hos-
pital. She was admitted with a
light blue skin. Two days later, it
was purple. Then, it became claret
red and finally brown. She told the
physicians that she felt as though
she had a bad case of sunburn, and
her temperature fluctuated from
day to day, frequently reaching 102
degrees. The unusual case baffled
the doctors. The only theory they
could advance was that the phenom-
enon was some sort of drug rash.
However, the patient could not re¬
call taking any medicines just prior
to her attack. So the cause of her
chameleonlike changes of color re¬
mains a mystery.

NOT ALL IS ROMANCE
Continued from page 9


tenant has aptly said: making man¬
gos flower and fruit is like betting
in a game of jueteng. For it is
not science alone that counts. The
element of chance also cannot be
eliminated. And you may be able
to make a mango flower but you
cannot always make it fruit, in
much the same way as you can lead
the proverbial horse to water but
not make him drink.
There are at present around
429,410 fruit-bearing mangos in
the Philippines, with an average
yield of 316 fruit per tree. The
average price per 100 mango fruit
is P2.14.
Since 1931, over 130,000,000
mangos have been reaped annually
in the entire Archipelago. Most of
these have been borne by trees in
the provinces of Bulacan, Nueva
Ecija, Rizal, Bataan, and Cavite. It
is not a well-known fact but some
of the fruit have come from as far
as Oriental and Occidental Misamis
and even the Sulu Archipelago.
More hectares are planted to
mangos than to any other fruit tree
here except the coconut alone.
(Please remember that bananas are
not trees, else I would have to make
a second exception—which I do not

enough luck.

soon be here. Confetti, however, is
no longer popular; but, if you are
Chinese, you’re still fond of it. So
buy any quantity you want, but
limit your fondness to only one col¬
or. Possession of confetti in mixed
colors, or mixed with waste, or
throwing confetti of more than one
color, are offenses Chief Piatt—ask
him why—would like to take you
before the judge for.
Regarding carnival costumes,
wear any you like best. That’s
your privilege. But don’t go gal¬
livanting in the auditorium or car¬
nival grounds garbed in the rai¬

meaning a priest. A priest may,


because of Christian kindness, ab¬
solve you for the desecration; but
a judge will surely look at it from
a different point of view, the legal
view.
The pen, they say, is mightier
than the sword; but, we always in¬
sist, the tongue is sharper. If you
are in doubt, just call your neigh¬
bor choice names, the more hair¬
raising the better, and a city fiscal
will convince you, through the
judge, what a keen point the tongue
has.
Send your children of school age
moviewards to see Joe E. Brown,
Shirley, or Laurel and Hardy. But
not during school hours or after
eleven at night. Some law-grad-
uate policeman or detective, and
there are plenty of them now
might remember Section 841 of
Manila’s revised ordinances and
cover himself with glory at your
expense.

want to know how the judge looks

So again as bar owner, saloc

Don’t let the boy fool you that th e

SUMMER MORNING

back-board. When one made a
spectacular shot, there was much
clapping, punctuated at times by
Tony’s booming “Boy, that was
some shot,” or “That was a beauty.”
I never saw Tony play with such
speed and shooting accuracy.
Now and then, when the ball
rolled some distance away, we
p sed for a breathing spell and
loc ed in the direction of the visi¬
to.s. But only for a spell. As soon
as the ball was retrieved, we were
all over the court again.
I saw them from the corners of
my eyes as they came out of the
garden just in front of the school.
I didn’t have to look directly at
them to make sure they were com¬
ing toward us. Tony picked up
speed. We all picked up speed. We
were running like a well-oiled ma¬
chine when somebody called Tony
by name.
Tony was with them in a mo¬
ment, talking, grinning tiredly.
fumbling with the ball all the while.
The coach handed him the kodak
and the professor invited Joe and
me to join them. We smiled our
thanks but went in the shade to rest
instead.
They posed near a goal. The pro¬
fessor, sitting in front of the girl
in black, grinned under the basket¬
ball he held up to protect his thin-
ning pate from the sun. The girls
beamed from behind open fans
which were closed and brought
down the moment Tony said,


“Ready.”
After that the professor posed
for a solo picture, holding the bas¬
ketball between his hands as if he
were in the act of shooting it into
the basket. Then Tony led them to
other parts of the ground. They
went to the well, where Tony took
their picture again and showed
them how to work the pump. They
went to the brook far behind the
school clinic and watched from the
bank while Tony, after taking off
his shoes and rolling up his trou¬
sers to his knees, waded through the
mud in the ankle-deep water and
gathered water-hyacinth flowers
for the girls. Tony took their
pictures as they posed on the rustic
bridge, the professor splashing the
water with a stick he held paddle¬
fashion.
Other places were visited, more
pictures taken, but whether sight-
seeing or posing, the professor was
always near the girl in black. She
was young and beautiful and her
white face and neck contrasted
beautifully with her black dress.
Her smile was beautiful—and she
smiled often at the professor.
It was 10:30 by Tony’s watch
when they took their leave. The
professor, leaning out of a window,
waved at us as the car whisked
away in a cloud of dust. We left
shortly afterwards.
The sun beat down on our bare
heads and the road was hot under
our rubber shoes. Joe said he was

QUESTIONS:—Are municipal
teachers entitled to the benefit of
the gratuity law recently passed
by the Philippine legislature? If
so, what is the least number of
years in the service that will en¬
title them to the benefit of the
aforementioned law?—Pedro Ajoc,
Batuan, Bohol.

titled to the benefit of the gra¬
tuity law. Twenty years in the
service is the least number of

QUESTIONS:—P has been clear¬
ing a swampy place since the Span¬
ish time. A portion of it now has
become a mainland and the other
portion which is very low becomes
muddy when tidal time comes and
is being used as saltern. The cadas¬
tral survey came and P requested
the surveyor to include the saltern

fused to include it and he says the
saltern belongs to the government.
Has P any right to claim that por¬
tion?
P planted nipa palms along the
side of the swampy place. The
higher portion of it belongs to B.
When the surveyor came, B claimed
the land planted with nipa palms
as his. Has P the right to claim
the swampy place?—P. B. Valdez,
Ma-ao Central Co., Occ. Negros.
ANSWERS:—If P had been in
open, actual, and continuous pos¬
session for ten years under claim
of ownership of the swampy place,
part of which he cleared and con¬
verted into saltern, and the rest
planted with nipa, he is the owner
of the same, and neither the gov-
ernment nor B is entitled to pos¬
session and ownership. (Act 339

QUESTION:—Avocado has been
repeatadli¬ -


notu iresn fruits?
—A. T. D., P.O. Box 81, Mt. Prov
ince.
ANSWER:—The avocado may be
distinguished from other fruits by
its very high food value. An
analysis of the composition of
twenty-eight varieties of avocado
showed a fat content of the flesh
ranging from 9.8 to 29.1 per cent
and a protein content ranging
from 1.3 to 3.7 per cent, indicating


that the energy value of the avo¬
cado is more than double that of
other commonly used fruits.—From
"The Stockman & Farmer.”

QUESTIONS:—According to Sec.
1203 of the Revised Administrative
Code of 1917, p. (d) which says:
“Every vessel of one-hundred gross
tons, but less than two-hundred
and fifty, shall have the following
officers: one first mate or one pa¬
tron in the major coastwise trade
who shall have charge of the vessel
as master, and one second or third
mate or one patron in the minor
coastwise trade, as mate; but when
such vessels make runs of more than
two-hundred miles measured from
the point of departure to the last
point of call, they shall carry two
mates, who may be of the class of
third mate or patron in the minor
coastwise trade.” How should the
distance be measured? Is it from
the point of departure direct to the
last port of call or from the point
of departure tracing the route of
the vessel to her last port of call?—
Alfredo T. Chanco, 387 N. America,
Cebu, Cebu.
ANSWER:—T h e distance is
measured from the point of de¬
parture, along the routes followed
by the vessel to her last port of
call.—Answered by Vicente Alda¬
nese, insular collector of customs,

QUESTIONS:—How can a per¬
son who desires to become an agent
of a radio company in the United
States obtain a license? How much
does the license cost?—G. M. San¬
tos, Iloilo, Iloilo.
ANSWERS:—A person who sells
in his own establishment radios
owned by a radio company in the
United States should secure a mer¬
chants’ (C-1) privilege tax-receipt
in the amount of P2.00 per annum
and pay the merchants’ sales tax

QUESTIONS:—Whether I have
a full or an empty stomach at night
dreams always bother me. Is
dreaming every night a menace to
one’s health? How can it be rem¬
edied?—A. C., Manila.
ANSWERS:—Frequent dreaming
is usually due to the presence of
many desires, or desires that have
not been fulfilled to one’s satis¬
faction either because circum¬
stances would not allow or because
they are against society, ethics, re
ligion, etc. A full or an empty
stomach has no connection with
dreams. Dreaming every night is
per se” not a menace to one’s
health. It is a symptom suggestive
of a functional disturbance of the
psyche. These people are usually
suffering from some form of
nsychoneurosis.—Answered by Dr.
L. Lopez-Rizal, chief, division of
administration, bureau of health,
Manila.

QUESTIONS:—What are the
causes and symptoms of tuberculo¬
sis? What should a tuberculous
person do in order to regain his
health?—Felix Lim, 244 Manalili
St., Cebu, Cebu.
ANSWERS:—Hereditary predis¬
position has been thought to play
an important role in determining
the disease in individuals. Chil-
dren of tuberculous parents are
believed to be more liable than
others to contract consumption.
A predisposition to tuberculosis
is acquired under conditions that
seripusly lower vital resistance.
Among those are overcrowding,
deficient ventilation, poor food,
prolonged and exhausting disease,


pregnancy and lactation, and un¬
healthful occupations, such as
glass blowing, coal mining, street
sweeping, exposure to cold and
damp, and the excessive use of
alcohol. The pulmonary complica
tions following measles and whoop-
ing cough in children are often
forerunners of a tuberculosis de¬
posit in the lungs. The disease
begins with slight but annoying
and unproductive cough, a slight
afternoon temperature, loss of ap¬
petite, and gradually increasing
weakness. A tuberculous person
must have good food, sleep, fresh
air, and rest in order to regain
health.—From “The New Interna¬
tional Encyclopaedia."
QUESTIONS:—Will you please
inform me how malaria is trans¬
mitted? How should a malaria pa¬
tient be treated?—A  
reader, Maypajo, Riazl.
ANSWERS:—Malaria is carried
from man to man by the bite of
infected anopheles mosquitoes.
Certain forms of malarial pa
rasites are taken in by the mos¬
quito from a person suffering
from the disease. These parasites
develop and multiply in the body
of the mosquito and may be trans¬
ferred to another person if the
mosquito is given the chance to
bite him. A malaria patient should
be treated if possible, only by a
physician. The dependable drugs
employed by phisicians for mala¬
ria are: quinine and cinchona
preparations, plasmochin and ata¬
brin.—From “The Health Messen¬
ger."

Consequently, our “champeen" won
the match. But he was very unim-
pressive as a victor. It was the de-
feated Wong who impressed us. His
aggressiveness, trajectories, and
near-perfect stroking made Gavia
appear like a beginner.
The two met again in the semi¬
finals of the fairly recent Metro¬
politan singles championship. Be¬
fore the match, we gasconaded to
tennis enthusiasts: “In this match,
messieurs, our Leonardo Gavia will
prove to all and sundry that he is
the complete master of Wong. He
will show that Wong’s victory in
the dual meet was a fluke and that
Wong needs some ten years more of
hard practice to win the Metro-


politan singles title!” Most of our
hearers agreed with us.
But Wong disproved our rodo¬
montade. He decisively outstroked,
outgeneraled, "out-everything" Ga¬
via in three of the four sets played.
This match is especially memorable
because Gavia tried very despe¬
rately to stave off defeat and
failed. He made a pitiable attempt
to hit his old-time stride. His an¬
ticipation of coming shots was any¬
thing but keen and uncanny. His
legs appeared to be palsied; and
very often, he hesitated in the mid-
dle of the court, obviously little
knowing where his opponent’s next
shots were to come from.
Spectators of his February, 1935,
match with Moon, missed, last De¬
cember, 1935, the power behind his
service. Instead, they saw Gavia,
the frequent and disheartening
double-faulter. His forehand shots
were sometimes lamentable pokes
that scarcely reached the net. His
backhand, though comparatively
better than his forehand, was not
the powerful and deceptive back¬
hand that nipped in the bud many
an attack of Moon last February.
His overhead smashes made us
stamp our foot disgustedly. They
gave Wong many points. Gavia’s
proverbial cramp-causing, behind-
the-net placements worked now and
then, but not with the frequency
and excellence he displayed in his
match with Moon. A shrewd brain
was behind every stroke he made,
but something was the matter with
his execution. Had all his superb


placements tallied, Wong would
have been caught stupidly flat¬
footed innumerable times, and the
outcome would have been different
Gavia’s defeat by Wong cost him
his Metropolitan singles title. In
this coming February classic, his
All-Comers’ title will be at stake.
Frankly, we are trepidation itself
for its safety!

That the masses quite know

not only are some of the proper¬

“Selling The Library Reading
Materials To School Children
By CANDIDO C. ARELLANO
Teacher-Librarian, Mabini Memorial School
Talaga, Tanauan, Batangas


FACULTY MEMBERS AND STUDENT-TEACHERS


Above are the members of the faculty and student-teachers of the
training department of the Lumbatan Agricultural School. At the
extreme left is Miss M. Dimaya and at the extreme right, Miss F. Villa¬
carillo, the new critic teachers. Seventh from the left, at the back row,

(*A horse may be successfully
led to water but it may
Anot be forced to drink,"
runs an old adage. Equally true
is the fact that school children
may be persuaded to go to the
school library but they may not be
forced to read worth-while reading
materials.
Observations have shown me that
many of the elementary school
pupils who go to the library of
their school read just for the sake
of reading because they know that
the library is a place intended for
such an activity. They read art¬
icles in magazines regardless of
merit and usefulness to them be¬
cause they lack the power of dis¬
crimination in selecting reading
materials.
Wholesome reading materials
are widely scattered in magazines
and newspapers, but the children
usually do not know what they are
and where to find them. The young
children do not persist in search-
ing for reading matter that suits
their interests, especially if they get
hold of periodicals that do not have
tables of contents. This unfortun¬
ately and indirectly develops among
them an abhorrence for reading.
Taking the pupils’ instinctive
curiosity, I use a device to "sell” the
reading materials in my library to
the school children I make a sur¬
vey, from time to time, of all the
reading materials carried by each
periodical and note down those that
suitably fall within the children’s
reading abilities and interests.
Then I prepare a reading guide and
place it in the library bulletin board.


1935,


The following is a sample of the
"sell-them-fast” device that appears
in the “reading guide" of my lib¬
rary bulletin board:
Something incredible: A full¬
fledged attorney who signs law do¬
cuments with his thumb print!
Read "Learned To Walk and Write
At Forty,” page 16, Sunday Tri¬
bune, September 22, 1935.
Would you kill the only pet that
is the source of your happiness in
your secluded life? Federigo did.
Read “The Falcon, page 21, Sun¬
day Tribune Magazine, September
22, 1935.
Have you heard of a woman who
stole her own husband's money?
Read “Theft Abroad to Limbas,
page 4377, Philippine Magazine,
September, 1935.
Want facts? Do not fail to read
“It Seems Incredible But—" and
“Wonders of the Philippines,” re¬
gular features in  .
Salay, Misamis, “Alaska of the
Philippines.” Try “A Fisherman's
Paradise," page 15, Philippines
Free Press, September 21, 1935.
The foregoing device greatly
aids the attainment of that li¬
brary work objective which will
make the pupils realize that the lib-
rary is a place for recreational, in¬
formational, as well as inspirational
reading. A few weeks after the
introduction of this device, my ad¬
vanced pupils offered their services
as agents in “selling” the worth-
while reading materials they had
read to their classmates.

My Great Grandma
By DELFIN FRESNOSA


-T was seldom that I visited my
home-town, but I found myself
Athere once and I called on my
great grandmother. From her hid-
den stores of memories I had hoped
to get materials for a story of the
Spanish times.
Her equally aged daughter, my
grandmother, met me at the door
and told me that Granny was in so¬
litary confinement in the kurob, a
storehouse for palay. Granny, the
daughter said, had peen most un¬
governable of late and, whenever
she was freed, wandered around the
town, picking up an assortment of
odds and ends.
Really, I said to myself, Granny
was disgracing the family From
the adjoining room, the storehouse,
came excited shrieks. Grandmother
looked out of the window and scol¬
ded the children who were thrust-
ing sticks through the walls scar¬
ing Granny.
I went inside and saw her. She
had scaled a wall.
“What are you doing here? Who
are you?” she said as she dropped
onto the floor.
“Don’t you remember me, Gran¬
ny?
I could not, because of Granny’s
condition, find the proper approach
to my already half-formulated
questions. In my awkwardness, I
aent - a dell made of cioth.


She ran and picked it up and, with
it in her arms, she began to croon.
"Who? That man? Trying to dis¬
turb my baby...” she said in baby
talk.
But in a moment she must have
forgotten, and she sat down before
a tiny stove with a pot as big as
a closed fist. She put some twigs
and pretended to light a fire. Then
she said to me: “Come here.” Next,
she placed a shriveled hand on my
shoulder and tried to smile. Her
teeth, I noticel, were very small;
her face, crisscrossed '5y wrink¬
les. She rearranged the tiny Knd.
of her hair, smoothed her dirty
chemise and tried to cover her an¬
kles with her tapis.
“You are my sweetheart and this
is our baby," she lisped glancing
from me to the baby. Then she got
up, tucked up her tapis, and said
running away: “Catch me..."
But, the next moment, another
mood seized her. She turned to
where I stood nonplussed and said
pouting, “If you make love to any
other girl...” and to the doll, she
said, "Shan’t we, baby? We’ll leave
him.”
I made a hurried exit and,
through the closed door, she
shouted while pounding the walls:
“Come back, my darling, my sweet¬
heart!”

Smoking
By REYMUNDO ORTIZ

 he prohibits smoking. I told
him that I can’t do well in my fav¬

to smoke. And I feel that that is
really true.
My uncle who is also a slave to
nicotine wants me to stop smoking
or he will cut my weekly allowance.
Perhaps he knows that out of his
smoking he derives nothing.
This habit of mine was started
by a roommate. He is a rabid
smoker. When he studies his les¬
sons he smokes. He says when he
smokes he thinks. Maybe he is
right. What I, at first, hate in
him is when he finishes eating
ahead of me, he at once lights a
cigarette and blows the smoke to¬
wards me. He knows I hate the
smell of tobacco more than I hate
the amell of lysol.

My lady friends, in expressing

habit, tell me that I am only burn¬

are right. And I know that my¬

Kolambugan Pupils
Learn Barbering In
School


Mohammedan Youths Seek
Improvement Of Moroland
By TOME N. BITENG


LMOST all schools are now
occupied with projects that
aim to prepare their stu¬
dents to face the realities of life.
Kolambugan School, Lanao, is one
of these schools.
It will be remembered that
when Mr. Andres Padayhag was in
charge of the fifth grade industrial
work, the Kolambugan Elementary
School pupils turned out the great¬
est number of pieces of finished
rattan furniture among the many
schools in the division, and perhaps,
even among all the schools in the
whole Archipelago. The pieces of
furniture were not of the simple
kind only. They ranged from the
easily-made chairs to the solidly
and delicately made tables and so¬
fas. They were of better quality
than those found in most of our
rattan furniture shops to-day be¬
cause the materials used were well¬
seasoned and well-selected. Strict
grading was the motto of Mr. Pa¬
dayhag and the pupils were forced
to do their best.
Recently, another project which
is worthy of sincere commendation
was undertaken by one of the teach-
ers. Mr. Casiano de la Rosa, a
graduate of the Pangasinan Trade
School and for the last four years
shop teacher of Kolambugan Inter¬
mediate School, aroused the inter¬
est of the parents of the school
children when he included hair-cut¬
ting as one of his projects for the
boys. Mr. de la Rosa’s project can
be well described by recounting the
first experience of one of his pu¬
pils.
“One morning as I entered our
shop building, I saw six pairs of
scissors, six razors, and several oth-

Above is a student barber, cutting the
hair of a student customer under the
supervision of the teacher. Mr. Casiano
de la Rasa (X).
“But hardly had we finished fix-
ing the barber’s implements when
a group of six first-graders entered
the room. One was assigned to me
while the rest went to my class¬
mates. As there were only six
pairs of scissors, the rest of my
classmates were appointed observ¬
ers. The interesting as well as
amusing part of the drama began
when the cutting was well under
way. My hands trembled and my
fingers were unsteady. All of us
were nervous. I saw beads of pers¬
piration on the forehead of each
amateur barber, myself not ex¬
cluded.
“We finished our first job in al¬
most an hour. We compared the
different heads to determine the
best beginner. One head impressed
me much. To give a fair descrip-
tion of it, it should be stated that
it looked like the rice terraces of
the Ifugaos. However, finishing
touches were made by the teacher
before the boys were allowed to re¬
turn to their classes.
“Now we can boast of ourselves
when it comes to hair cutting. We
are improving by leaps and bounds.
We hope to show our ability to the
public soon. We are very thankful
to our teacher and the parents of
the school children are grateful to
us for now they can save their cen¬
tavos instead of giving them to
fessional barbers."

two petitions and a resolution.
The petitions asked for a more
liberal application of the civil

tants of the Philippines; the exten¬
sion of local autonomy to the na¬

WONDERS OF THE PHILIPPINES-B, Rovaie


YANY have often wondered about
NI the unusually dark color and alien
features of half of the inhabitants of
Cainta, Rizal. The explanation is in
history.
The British invasion of Manila took
place in 1762, two years after the estab¬
lishment of the town of Cainta. The
invaders’ army was composed of 1,500
Europeans and 2,200 Sepoys (Hindu sol¬
diers in the employ of the British gov-


ernment). When the English cam-
paigned in the present province of Ri¬
zal, a number of Sepoys, perhaps at¬
tracted by the alluring native belles and
the favorable conditions obtaining in
that part of the country, decided to set¬
tle in the barrio of Dayap, Cainta,
which was woodland at the time. They
married native girls, had their own
families, tilled the soil, and eventually
cleared the place.


Vendors of Sweepstake Tickets
Arrested
Vendors of sweepstakes tickets
peddling their wares on the Escolta
were arrested wholesale by the po¬
lice on orders from Chief Piatt the
other Tuesday morning and fined
P2 each. The chief actio
from the complaints of peopie who
declared that the venders have be¬
come a nuisance, what with their
accosting people on sidewalks and
blocking pedestrian traffic. The
campaign will perhaps be extended
to other streets in the downtown
section. There is an ordinance pro¬
hibiting peddling on the Escolta
and other streets in the city.

It is remarkable to note that after
more than one and a half centuries, the
inhabitants of Dayap still retain the
color, height, hairiness, vigorous phy-
sique, and a few other characteristics
of their forbears, and that these char¬

within their small district.

RHODES SCHOLAR
L
Continued from page 20
grandfather’s stories of early days,
stories of hardships and failures
and victories, stories that gave this
soil a history and a background.
This was the boy’s region by in¬
heritance.
“Heah."
“Mr. Huddleston."
But there are circumstances—
he began to himself with a feverish
compression of his lips.
“Mr. Janson-Smith.” “Heah."
The Rhodes scholar recalled the
thesis he had written for his mas¬
ter’s degree at his. State University.
He had fairly immersed himself in
the early history of his state. What
fun it had been, sitting in the State
Historical Library, slowly working
through the several panels of coun¬
ty histories. These bulky, old-fash-
ioned volumes, padded with Civil
War rosters and records of early
business machinations, had chap¬
ters that effervesced with pio¬
neers’ lives—their dreams, their
brawlings, their courage in break¬
ing sod that was matted with roots
of prairie grass.
“Mr. Knox.” “Heah.”
The scholar gripped the bench.
Were they already at the n’s? No,
a Knox was a k. At that only a few
more moments remained until the
fatal words “Mr. Ross.”
“Mr. Lansdowne.” “Heah.”
Perhaps he could say "Present"
and avoid the difficulty. No, no one
said it since the very first man, and
that would be sidestepping the issue
anyway. He would have to bend
his action one way or other all dur¬
ing his Oxford time.
“Mr. Lawrence.” “Heah."
He darted his eyes feverishly
among the English boys. They
were still and intent with “first-
day” stiffness. They all had on the
little commoner’s gown, like his
own. Each person in front of him
was an item of black uniformity.
Could he stand out against them all
with his own kind of a “here”?
“Mr. Martin.” “Heah.”
Isn’t it the better part of discre¬
tion to "fit in?” Didn’t his grand¬
parent pioneers adapt themselves
to the prairie? Every one had told
him not to remain an outsider in
Oxford.
“Mr. Murray.” “Heah.”
He didn’t want to be an outsider.
“Mr. Niblett.” “Heah.
He was becoming part of an "an¬
cient and honorable" college, with
centuries behind it. Shouldn’t he
submit to its ways? He was sent
here to fit in, to get what Oxford
was supposed to give. Everybody
said “Heah.” That was the way.
It doesn’t pay to make a fool of
yourself.
“Mr. Otley.” “Heah.”
He could change his pronuncia¬
tion. People had done it before. But
it was nasty business, he realized.
His teacher in freshman composi¬
tion had been brought up in lowa
and had got her master’s degree at
the State University, and then after
one summer session at Columbia in
New York City she had come back
with a full-fledged Eastern accent.


How people had razzed her behind
her back and recounted incidents
where she had forgotten for the
moment!
“Mr. Padwick.” “Heah."
God, the p’s!
And there was that fat returned
Rhodes scholar at his American col¬
lege whom everybody had disliked.
He had lifted his hat whenever he
met another man. He was the
kind who said “Heah."
The scholar formed the syllables
on his lips, experimentally—“Heah.”
How—a—perverted it sounded. He
gulped laboriously and swayed for¬
ward with his head bent.
“Don’t be an outsider,” he snarled
at himself. "Don’t make a show of
yourself here at the beginning!”
“Mr. Partridge.” “Heah."
But I’d be a traitor!” he gasped.
"I’m an American, and I know I
love my Middle West, my prairie."
“Mr. Pennington.” “Heah.”
“Don’t be a fool!”
“Mr. Radford.” “Heah.
“Mr. Ross."
The eyes of the few who had
learned his name turned upon him,
and before making his answer he
rumbled his throat in a preliminary
way.
Vargas Heads Sugar Office
¡RESIDENTIAL Secretary
Y
Jorge Vargas is now also

administration, an office created
by executive order last week in
accordance with Act. 4166 other-
wise known as the Sugar Limita¬
tion Law.

latter to assem¬

Antonio Luzur¬
riaga has been
appointed as¬
sistant sugar administrator. Both
men, however, have been, since the
inauguration of the Commonwealth
government, acting as domestic su¬
gar administrators and their recent
appointments were in the nature of
a confirmation.
Under the sugar limitation law
the President is empowered to is¬
sue rules and regulations govern¬
ing allotments and licenses and
such other rules and regulations
necessary to carry out the provi¬
sions of the law. The new office of
which Secretary Vargas is head will
perform for the president these
duties.
Incidentally, High Commissioner
Murphy issued Order No. 1 regard¬
ing sugar providing for the full en¬
forcement of the 1936 effective su¬
gar quota for the Philippines. The
effective quota for this year is
967,053 short tons the allocation of
which to each Philippine mill has
been entrusted to the high commis¬
sioner.

While non-committal on whether
or not he would accept the nomina¬

High Commissioner Murphy last
Friday night said he had not given
the matter enough thought as he has
many more things to do in the Phil¬

MALACANANG
President Quezon is considering
the dismissal of provincial gover¬
nors who cannot suppress jueteng
in their provinces, he revealed to
the press last Friday. Last week
he was trying to ascertain wheth-
er or not he has the authority to
effect such a drastic action; he
said if he has not, he would re¬
quest the national assembly to
grant him the power and would
seek the amendment of the gam¬
bling laws in order to penalize per¬
sons found playing jueteng with
imprisonment instead of small
fines. The president believes that
jueteng has caused tax delinquen¬
cies.
* * *


A letter of reprimand was last
Thursday sent, upon the direction
of President Quezon, by Secretary
Vargas to one Porfirio U. Sevilla,
residing in New York, warning
him not to continue pretending to
have close connections with the
president and with other high gov-
ernment officials in the Philippines.
Malacanang has recently been re¬
ceiving information to the effect
that Sevilla has been making
American capitalists believe that
he is in a position to secure for
them special opportunities for prof-
itable investments in the Philip-
pines.
* **
DEPARTHENIS
To the department of justice has
been endorsed all the resignations
presented to President Quezon as a
result of his ruling that public of-
ficials should not engage in private
business. The reports of the de-
partment secretaries concerning
the activit'es of all officials under
their departments who are engaged
in private business have also been
referred to the department of jus¬
tice for legal determination.

The contract of the Manila Ter¬
minal Company with the govern-
ment, through the Manila Har-
bor Board, to operate the arras¬
tre service in the port of Manila
will terminate next May 31st, ac¬


cording to a decision made by
Sec. of Finance Quirino last Fri¬
day after a consultation with
President Quezon. The government
will operate the arrastre service
which is expected to be a good


source of revenue. The Manila

management of the service when

by the committee on accounts of the

pending accounts of the former

on appropriations of the national

JUDICIARI
The organization of the inter¬

cede the revamping of the whole
judicial system in the Philippines,
it was learned last Sunday. For in¬
stance, the more than 1,000 justices
of the peace may be reduced by 50
per cent, and the courts of first
instance will probably be grouped
into districts tor purposes of ad¬
ministration.

in the left wing of the Ayuntamien¬

Imprisonment of from 6 to 30
years was the punishment meted
out by Judge Sotero Rodas of the
Bulacan court of first instance to
each of five of the six men accused
of assaulting a pair of eloping lov¬
ers in Nueva Ecija last November
22, 1934. Those found guilty are
Marciano Mabanata, Luis Bernardo,
Alberto Dinio, Cecilio Santos, and
Pedro Santiago. According to the
findings of the court these men
waylaid Gaudencia Joson and An¬
tonio Sta. Inez while they were
eloping to the man’s home at Ga¬
pan, N. E. They beat up the young
man and criminally assaulted the
girl. The young man managed to
escape but he died a few days later
in a hospital because of his inju¬

STOLIN TAXICAB WRECKED BY DRIVER


Phote shows what had once been a midget taxicab after landing wrong side
up when it crashed into a post on Vermont street, Malate, early last week.
The vehicle had been stolen by an unidentified person who, wanting to earn a
few centavos, picked up four passengers. The driver fled after the accident,
leaning behind four bruised passengers,


raga, was hacked to death by an un¬
identified robber whom he sur¬
prised looting his store at one
e’clock a. m. last Friday. Hearing
noises in the store shortly before '
o'clock, Hing got up from his bed
and turned on the light. He came
upon a man in short pants, ransack¬
ing the money box. The surprised
burglar tried to escape, but Hing
blocked his way.

to the authorities. But seeing how
hopeless his case was (he wrote a
farewell note to that effect), he
determined to end his life. The sol¬

meal in another room of the bar¬
racks, when the bandit stole to the
ordnance room, got his confiscated
shotgun, and shot himself.

FIGHTING PRIEST STIRS UP HORNETS' NEST IN U. P


YATHER E. J. MeCarthy, Co¬
lumban missionary priest and
lecturer on ethics for the U. P.
Scholastic Philosophy Club, the
other week stirred up a hornets”
nest when he charged that certain
U.P. professors have been "spread¬
ing anti-Catholic propaganda," es¬
pecially pointing out Prof. Sera¬
fin Macaraig’s book, “Social Pro¬
blems,” as attacking Catholic mo¬
rals. He reiterated that anti-Cath-
olic activities are also allowed to
exist unheeded in the university.
The Philippine Collegian, in its
issue for the week, came out with
a scathing editorial, assailing Fa¬
ther MeCarthy for making undue
statements against the professors
while inside university premises.
The next Sunday, the chemistry
lecture room, for eight months the
meeting place of the Scholastic Phi¬
losophy Club, was padlocked for the
first time. Father MeCarthy, un¬
daunted, held his lecture at the U.
P. grandstand.
Father MeCarthy declared he was
grossly misrepresented by the U.
P. paper and the Manila press, and
that he would try to stop anti-Cath-
olic activities of certain professors;
that if they didn’t desist, he would
bring the matter to the board of re¬
gents, and later to the government
and the people through the bishops
and priests.
U. P. Professor Zafra, conduct¬
ing an inquiry, declared that the
Collegian’s report of Father Mc¬


would submit documents to
substantiate their charges.

to establish a sister society in Ma¬

pino-Japanese society will be cen¬
tered on the regular exchange of
information regarding cultural in¬
stitutions and movements in both
countries, the promotion of educa¬

Father E. J. MeCarthy


Carthy’s lecture was biased and ex¬

ture. The college editor, however,
reiterated that he was ready to
stand by his editorial as well as the
Collegian’s account of the lecture.
President Bocobo, in a special
meeting of college deans last week,
decided to allow the scholastic phi¬
losophy club to continue its meet¬
ings, but that Father MeCarthy
should confine himself to lectures
on ethics and the principles of scho¬

Readers Comment On
MInonymous Mrticle


N an article in last week’s
issue of  , a na¬
t tionally known industrialist
(whose name was withheld for
obvious reasons) said that the sal¬
vation of our laborers lies largely
in their own hands. In his article,
Are the Poor Getting Poorer? the
manufacturer indicated that the
government is already doing its
part to help the poor and that
there is nothing more the govern¬
ment can do, as it has already
done all conceivable ways of help¬
ing the people.
Below are a few of the many
comments our readers have made
regarding the article:
Secretary Ramon Torres of the
department of labor: “As secretary
of labor, and as one conversant with
our labor problems and the prob¬
lems of the masses, I agree with
the industrialist and author of the
article Are the Poor Getting Poor¬
er? when he said that the govern¬


Sec. of Labor Torres: believes that
the salvetion of the poor lies in their
own hands.

E


ment is doing all it can to help the
laborers. When the governmen
created a department exclusively
to look after the interests of labo
and gave representation to laboy
in the cabinet, it practically re
futed all charges that it has neg-
lected the welfare of the common
people. The author of the article
said much truth when he said that
the salvation of these people is in
their own hands."


Councilor Torres: says the government
has still plenty to do for the poor.
Councilor Antonio Torres: “I do
not know who wrote that article but
I agree with him on certain points
and I disagree with him on others. I
believe that there are still plenty
of things the government should do
for our laborers.”

How to get the most from Rouge
Have you an oval face? Then fate has smiled upon you. For poets and
painters, musicians and beauticians all agree that the oval cameo is the
ideal shape of face.
But—before you run around town congratulating vourself on your good
fortune—be sure that you’re not spoiling the ar
face with poor rouging technique.
Your rouge should be applied by starting it from
in line with the end of your nose. Then work it up and out to your
cheekbone, thus forming a triangle of color when the make-up is com¬
plete.
Splendid!
Keeping these simple facts in mind should broaden Fate’s smile to a

OUR YOUNG "SOCIALITES"
Continued from page 4


who wants to get into good society.
And, when is the next party com¬
ing? Will there be plenty of cock¬
tail?"
Attorney Jacobo Gonzales, of the
city believes that perhaps other
people can be mutually benefited
if only the National Assembly will
push through a bill to tax luxuries.
It will mean a sure income for
charity and, at the same time,
might indirectly teach young peo¬
ple the ideal of spending one’s mon¬
ey wisely.
“Philanthropy is a civic virtue
we have not, as yet, developed,” he
said. “All we understand by sat¬
isfaction is the pleasing of one’s
self. But real pleasure comes from
helping those in need. If only we
have less of expensive balls and
more of philanthropy!”
Another observer avers that in¬
feriority complex pushes others to
spend lavishly We desire nothing
better than to appear what we are
not, he said, to be thought of as
rich and be classified with the so¬
ciety greats. That is why others
go in heavily for society stuff and
seriously believe that they are do¬
ing the community something good.
They forget the basic fact that
their lavish expenses never help
the masses any, except the caterers
decorators, and orchestra members!
Now listen to Miss Ursula Ui¬
chanco, dean of women at the U.P.:
“I have been always opposed to
balls and dances, especially the ex¬
pensive ones. There is not much
sense in them. But they answer:
we are young only once. Well,
tell them, you stay young by dan¬
cing for ten years; and, after that,
what? Has dancing—during ter
years—done anybody any good?
Has it brought him something
material, has it made him do to
others something by way of Chris¬
tian kindness and charity?
"As I always say, there are other
enjoyable and more wholesome re¬


creations than dances. It may be
swimming, hiking, helping others,
putting up educational programs.
Some people have found lasting joy
in them. But the trouble is that a
lot don't. Let’s have the dances,
high class ones, they say.
“We can have a lot of fun with-
out spending a lot of money. For
example, the U. P Woman’s Club
recently had a party. Everyone en¬
joyed the affair, and there were
about three hundred people there.
There was no dancing but plenty of
wholesome entertainment. And the
club spent only thirty pesos! Now
think, just how much comfort, how
nuch relief, what benefit the poor
would get if the money saved were
spent for charity, say."
Another critic also blames the
higher-ups. They lead in extra¬
vagance and others follow them
Look at the parties given in Mala¬
canang, at the Manila Hotel, at the
Club Filipino, and other exclusive
places. And also that affair by a
certain firm which was reputed to
have cost P20,000!

What “future undertakings” these
four capable gentlemen will do
after February 1st, are not known.
However, it is indicated that one
of them at least is joining a large
American law firm of the city.
Others are leaving for the States,

of the American justices who re-
signed are entitled to the gratuity
fixed under the American gratuity
law. The amount will depend upon
the length of service of each in the
government. Some of them will be
entitled to as much as P40,000.
Justices Hull, Vickers, Butte, and
Goddard were all appointed by for¬
mer President Herbert Hoover o
the United States. Associate Jus¬
tice John A. Hull, who occupied the
positions of Judge Advocate Gen¬
eral (with the rank of major) of
the United States army and legal
adviser of Governor-General Theo¬
dore Roosevelt, was named to the
high court on June 1, 1932. Jus¬
tice James C. Vickers, who was
judge of the Manila court of first
instance for many years, was ap¬
pointed by President Hoover on the
same date. Both of them were
members of the high tribunal for
about four years. Associate Jus¬
tices Butte and Goddard were ap¬
pointed by President Hoover dur¬
ing the time of former Governor¬
General Roosevelt. Justice Butte
was vice governor-general of the
Philippines during the term of for¬
mer Gov.-Gen. Davis.
The acceptance of the resignations
of the four members of the sup¬
reme court leaves a vacancy in the
high court. There will only be
six Filipino justices of the sup¬
reme court if another one is not ap¬
pointed by February 1st. The re¬
maining six Filipino members of
the high court are: Chief Justice


Ramon Avancena, Associate Jus¬
tices Jose Abad Santos, Claro M.
Recto, Anacleto Diaz, Carlos A. Im¬

READERS COMMENT ON
Continued from page 53


terpretation of our labor problems
in his article in  ."
L. Covacha, president, National
Labor League: “I disagree most
emphatically with the author of the
article Are the Poor Getting
Poorer?
“Is the government doing enough
for the interest of laborers? Does
it look after the welfare of the
masses, and help them in their
fights against the injustices im-
posed by capital? I should say not.
“The government has no definite
labor program and has not, as yet,
laid down a constructive labor pol¬
icy. The government has not ful¬
filled its promises to our laborers,
and has failed to enforce all labon
legislations enacted by the legisla¬
ture."
Tomas Magsalit, wage-earner con¬
nected with the Luzon Brokerage:
“The man who said that we can
live decently and eat well if we
work is not telling the truth. If,
as he said, he started as a poor
man, then circumstances must have
favored him exceedingly well.
“I can show myself to anyone as
an example, and can point at a hun¬
dred others who live near my home
in Tondo, of persons who work as
hard, if not harder than the pres¬
ident of this country. And yet, we
and the members of our families,
eat but twice or sometimes only
once a day. We are willing to do
any kind of work. We are never
afraid of hard work, because we are
used to it. But most of us are al¬
lowed to work only four out of the
six working days in the week. The
rest of the time, we remain idle be¬
cause there is nothing to do. The
author of the article said that we
can go to railroad and truck sta¬
tions, or to our public markets and
earn from P.50 to P.80. He does
not know perhaps that cargadores
in these places quarrel over the lit¬
tle business that they can get, and
that dozens of them only play chess
all day because there are no bag¬
gages or goods to carry.”
Ruperto Cristobal, president,
Philippine Labor Union: “I agree
with the writer of the article. The
salvation of our workers are en¬
tirely in their own hands. The gov-
ernment helps those who help them¬
selves and the few who complain
are those who do not want to work.
Our union has a slogan: "Our Pro¬
gress Lies In Us.' That is prac¬
tically what the writer of the art-
icle also wishes to emphasize. The
truth is that only a small fraction
of our working class is dissatis¬
fied, and that only a small per¬
centage of our laborers is aware
of the movements of the labor lead
ers and the stir created by agita¬
tors."

COMMENTS
VO
YT is hard to state any opinion regarding the
NOT THIS
CONTROVERSY I controversy between Father MeCarthy and
certain members of the faculty of the University
of the Philippines. We did not hear the lectures of Father MeCarthy,
we have not read the books objected to by the said priest. Furthermore,
it has been claimed that the lectures of Father McCarthy have been de¬
liberately misrepresented in the press. We are not thus, expressing any
opinion on the controversy itself—for lack of competence.
But we do want to say that a controversy of the nature of that now
in progress in the University of the Philippines, tending as it does to
divide the student body on the question of religion, is dangerous. Reli¬
gion is a question many people easily lose their temper over, one way
or another. It would be a sad thing, and it would not be to the credit of
any sect or school of thought involved should the country be stirred un¬
duly over religion. Contemporary Mexico and Spain offer good examples
of what religious controversy carried to the extreme can lead up to.
There is supposed to be religious freedom and freedom of thought
in this country: tolerance of each other’s faith; tolerance of each other’s
thoughts. Why not a little tolerance from all sides, a little less of the
tendency to be too prone to suspect that an idea is hostile necessarily
because it is different?
It might be said here that unless Father MeCarthy succeed in making
his side clear in his controversy with some professors in the state uni¬
versity, the impression will persist that the priest is unduly interfering
with affairs which do not concern him. The demand for the elimination
of certain professors and the promise of espionage attributed to Father
MeCarthy the public does not associate with men in Father MCCarthy’s
position.


THEN WHAT? TTHERE has been a great deal of hostile com-
A ment against the attention bestowed by Presi¬
dent Quezon upon bandit Encallado. It is now being claimed that because
of this unwarranted attention which included the use of car 1-c for En¬
callado’s trip back to Tayabas, the bandit is now a hero instead of a public
enemy in his province.
We are not ourselves so hot, to use a vulgar word, for the pamper¬
ing bestowed by the President upon Encallado. We believe that Encalla¬
do is a bandit (until we are convinced to the contrary) and merits no
special privileges. But it is wrong to suppose that Encallado is consi¬
dered a hero in Tayabas now because, among other things, he has been
paroled and has been able to ride in one of the President’s cars.
The truth of the matter is, Encallado among his own people in the
province has never been a bad man. He is considered, whether we like
it or not, as a sort of hero who had gone to the mountains, dared consta¬
bulary bullets, and suffered hardships that the masses might be better
treated by the government. If Encallado had returned in a culesa or
afoot from the mountains, he would still be a hero to the misguided
masses who believe in him.
It should be said now that however much the President has shocked
the sensibilities of many people by his rather unorthodox handling of
Encallado, he seems to be getting results. Following the parole of the
bandit leader many of the hunted bandits have already surrendered. At
the time of this writing only four remain roaming the mountains.
So far, then, so good, the opinion of the critics notwithstanding. But
after the capture of the bandits, what? In Tayabas and Laguna bets are
being offered that Encallado will not go to prison. It is the general be¬
lief that the other bandits captured will be handled with gloves, the mur¬
ders they have committed notwithstanding. Just what has the govern¬
ment promised these brigands for their surrender?
Beyond justice the government has no right to promise anything.
mulat s stice the government ghould now proceed to bestow: for mur¬
ders, what urderers deserve, and so on. The government owes the ban¬
dits nothing for surrendering. The government should not think it owes
these lawbreakers a favor because it did not become necessary to kill
them outright.

Poser
That controversy raging
this time over at the U. P. is a poser
It seems to us it was freedom
thought which encouraged some
people there to say what they
think about what some other
people think. And now they are
quarreling because somebody said
what he thinks and others said
what they think. Oh, well, there
are always people who insist on
making life a lot harder to live.
(That’s what we think.)

Ask The Monkeys
It appears that one of the
causes of the present controversy in
