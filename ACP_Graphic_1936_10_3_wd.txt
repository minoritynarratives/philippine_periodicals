* YOTHING like adversity unites the people of a country.
N Germany is an example. Beaten in the World War,
humiliated as a consequence, shoved back into the rank
of a minor power, the Germans have been able to use this
adversity as the very inspiration for a new German nation.
Result: Germany is back in front, among countries
which, for the present, are virtual rulers of the world.
Then there is Italy. A victor in the World War, she suffered,
in a way, greater humiliation than Germany because she was
considered a minor power and treated accordingly in the division
of the spoils of war. Italy never forgot that. Result: Italy has
dared successfully almost the whole world in her conquest of
Ethiopia. Far more valuable than the annexation of Ethiopia to
the Italian empire is the respect that the world pays Italy at pre¬
sent.
But on the other hand there is the example of China. No
other country at present has suffered from adversity as much as
she. Outer Mongolia is Soviet territory in fact if not in name.
Manchuria is Japanese. Inner Mongolia and North China are fast
becoming a portion of the Japanese empire. In China every world
power has authority superior to that of the Chinese government.
Insulted all around, threatened seriously out of sovereignty, it


would seem that the instinct of self-preservation if nothing else
would unite the Chinese at last and compel them to forge a new
China, a China potent enough to require and force respect of her
territorial integrity and international rights.
But China continues to flounder along, losing territory piece¬
meal, unable to check Japan’s steady drive against Chinese so¬
vereignty. When unity is most badly needed, what should crop
up but another civil war, a threat if not an actuality, to weaken
further the country’s already insignificant power at resistance.
At this time another civil war is staring China in the face.
With China united, it is inconceivable at this time, to even imagine
that China can give Japan serious opposition. And yet Canton
is apparently willing to fight Nanking to settle an argument as
to how best to fight Japan!
Perhaps, China may yet be jolted into unity, into a
bonding suf ficiently solid to prevent the writing into his¬
tory of the passing away of a nation. Perhaps, like the
Germans or the Italians, the Chinese will rise above the
ruins of def eat and establish a new nation.
But China had better wake up soon. Or there would
be no more China to rebuild into a new nation.

COMMENTS—by The Editor
THE SPOTLIGHT .................. 55


FEALKING about poems read out to
1 appreciative listeners, we still re¬
member how impressed the audience was
when “Angelus” (see page 41) was re¬
cited by its own author at a meeting of
the National Teachers College Writers
Club: Antonio Estrada actually paid
personal tribute there and then. It is
really true that a poem is best savored
when read aloud—by one who knows how
to read thus.... There is a touching lit-
tle story behind Angelus, and Miss De
los Reyes has told it in a fine essay, "On
Being Asked to Write a Poem,” which
was published in The Scrap Book, literary
organ of the N.T.C.W.C.
WACATION has its drawbacks, ac¬
y cording to Esperanza Pura Galen¬
zoga, who tells why—with no little hum¬
or—on page 14 of this issue. Us, we
think that the real drawback of vacations
is that they seem to come, mostly, to those
who don’t know how to make the best
use of them. But you’d better listen to
Miss Galenzoga. We remember her, by
the way, as winning more than once in
our weekly literary contest for students.
r UR colleague Anden’s article this
week is “They Are Kids But They
Are Collegians” (page 10) From it we
learn that the average age of the college
freshman is decreasing every half-decade
or so. We could make a crack about that,
but for once at least we will not strain
ourself trying to show you how clever we
can be. Only we’d like to get some sta¬
tistics about the average age of the about¬
to-graduate and post-graduate students.
We have a hunch that that is increasing
rather than decreasing every five years
or so, for we know quite a number of
people who seem to love university life so
much that after finishing one course, they
blithely begin another....
YNE of those featured in “Honoris
O Causa” this week is the sort of man
we can envy He is J. L. Liquigan.
Here is a man who seems to find fun in
doing something not easy for nothing
that can be reckoned in pesos and cent¬
avos. And part of his work is typing,
single-space, something like thirty-six
pages a month. If we could type as much
in that time during our leisure hours,
we’d be more famous than we are. Or
should be...
 RDANETA, Pangasinan, has a
D cure for it Or them, rather, mean¬
ing those cases which can be settled with-
out too much expense and ill feeling and
red tape—but which, too often, are not.

T least a portion of the un¬
employment problem will be
AAsolved next year if the 847
new positions proposed in the 1937
budget, which was submitted the
other Tuesday by President Que¬
zon for the consideration of the
National Assembly, will be ap-
proved. This will involve a total
increase in salaries and wages
amounting to P707,563.
Biggest Share
The Department of Finance, with
246 new positions, will get the big¬
gest slice in the new positions out¬
lays: P346,306. With 126 new
positions the Department of Agri¬
culture and Commerce will have an
appropriation increase of P82,240,
while P76,348 will go for the 239
new positions in the Department of
Public Instruction.
The Department of Public Works
and Communications will use up
P54,486 for the 144 new positions
created in it. The Department of
Labor which obtained 60 new posi¬
tions will receive for this increase
the sum of P78,750, while the of¬
fices under the direct control of
the President got 11 new positions
at the total cost of P81,840.
This increase in appropriations
is, however, offset by the reduc-
tions in other items of expendi¬
ture, the elimination of some po¬
sitions by retirement of officials
and by the consolidation of offices,
and the creation of two revolving
funds. All in all these economies
will mean a total decrease of P663-.
902.
₱61,767,138-Appropriation
The total appropriation recom-
mended for 1937 is P64,767,138, as
against the estimated revenue of
₱65,817,400, or ₱1,050,262 less than
the expected income. To the aver¬
age taxpayer, who is used to com-
puting monetary matters in two
figures at most, these amounts are
impressive but do not leave much
meaning in his head. Perhaps it
will impress him more to be ap-
prised that the sum tentatively
appropriated for next year would
allot P4.88 for each of the over 13
million people (including children
and babies) populating the Islands.
Financial State Not Bad
Of course the measly sum of a


Sec. A. de las Alas: His department
has biggest slice af new positions.


Under-Secretary Serafin Marabut:
prepared the 1937 budget.


little more than a million pesos will
not be the only sum left to line our
coffers by the end of 1937, as there
will be other residues left. By the
end of this year we will have, as
accumulated net surplus from the
previous years, the sum of P31,490,-
458.41. Except for about P5,000,-
000, which represents "liquid as¬
sets, every centavo of this sum is
in cold cash, of which P9,090,458.41
is unencumbered.
President Quezon would have
this accumulated surplus untouched.
“Except for some urgent and vital
public need,” he warned the assem¬
blymen when he submitted the
proposed budget, “further drain
upon the accumulated surplus
would not be advisable. Any mea¬
sure involving the expenditure of
public funds should be supplement-
ed by the enactment of laws creat¬
ing new sources of revenue or in¬
creasing those already in effect.”
Unnecessary Expenses Eliminated
While it is true that the total
ordinary expenditures proposed for
1937 exceed those authorized for
this year by P35,031.50, this is
more than compensated by the fact
that the 1937 budget, besides re¬
ducing excessive and eliminating
unnecessary expenditures, contains
increases in appropriations amount-
ing to P1,618,732.15 for the im¬
provement and extension of essen¬
tial public services.
The appropriations which have
been increased include those affect-
ing the bureaus of internal revenue,
customs, and forestry, which, be¬
cause of lack of personnel, have in
the past not been able to collect all
the taxes due the government. In
other words, the investment in
these tax-collecting bureaus is ex¬
pected to be more than repaid by
the increased collections.
About P330,500 of the increase in
appropriation is for the care of the
insane and the sick, and for the
free distribution of medicine among
the poor.
To Repeal Belo Fund
President Quezon would not call
the Belo Fund an “unnecessary ex¬
pense,” but just the same he re¬
commended in his budget message
its elimination effective January
1, 1938. To those not in the know,
it may be explained that the Belo
Fund consists of an annual appro¬

priation of P250,000 to be used by
the chief executive as he may see
fit—often for the services of addi¬
tional technical advisers.
The President made it plain that
he would have asked for the imme¬
diate repeal of the law authorizing
him the use of that fund if it were
not for the fact that the Common-
wealth is still in its formative
years and would need a close sup¬
ervision and control of the chief


executive. "During these first two
years in the life of the Common¬
wealth,” President Quezon ex¬
plained, "I feel that the President
should have at his disposal the
amount appropriated by said Act...
so that he may be able to exercise
supervision and control, not only
over the affairs of the National
government but of the provinces
and municipalities as well."

HACIENDA TROUBLE GETTING SERIOUS —
SOLDIERS REENFORCED


By ALBERTO N. OBANA


ANGASINAN is at present
just like Nueva Ecija, ex¬
A periencing several agrarian
troubles. At the Hacienda Espe¬
ranza in Umingan, soldiers had to
be rushed the other Tuesday be¬
cause several ejected tenants re¬
entered the hacienda premises and
tried to occupy their former lots
which are now being farmed by

new tenants. An adverse court
decision had prohibited them from
making an entry.
The agrarian situation in Umi¬
ngan, however, appears slight con¬


sidering the serious land litigation
that now faces the Hacienda Her¬
manas Nable-Jose, whose lands run
through the towns of Tayug, Nati¬
vidad, San Quintin, and Santa Ma¬
ria of the same province. Free pa¬
tent claimants, that is, people who
have settled on agricultural land'
and cultivated the same since "time
immemorial” (in the legal accepta¬
tion) without obtaining title of
possession, are now claiming the


lands allegedly taken by the men¬
tioned hacienda.
Represented By Tripartite Groups
Not so long ago, these free pa¬
tent applicants claimed possession


of tracts of land within the hacien¬
da boundaries. Represented by the
Sanchez, Vidal, and Espique groups,
they filed a land claim against the
estate in the court of first instance
of Pangasinan. Last May 27th a
mass meeting of the interdictos
was held at the town plaza of Ta¬
yug, during which attorneys for the
claimants revealed important phas¬
es of the land dispute.
Through Mr. Emilio Mundok, an¬


other tenant representative, it was
told to the writer that hacienda
“El Porvenir,” a section of Hacien¬
da Hermanas Nable-Jose, originally
had only an arca of 448 hectares,


In Pantabangan, hundreds of
homesteaders and Abilaos (pri¬
mitive natives of Nueva Ecija)
were about to attack the town
when a detachment of Constabu¬
lary soldiers under the command
of Lt. Luis Chaves arrived and
dispersed the crowd. Soldiers
and police officers searched in
vain for the agitators and the
leaders who planned the upris¬
ing. Provincial Commander
Margarito Toralba of Pangasi¬
nan had to send reenforcements
to his men in Umingan, Panga¬
sinan, in view of a possible clash
between ejected tenants and
present occupants of the Hacien¬
da Esperanza. Reporis last
week stated that the disgruntled
tenants and their sympathizers,
armed with bolos and led by
radical agitators, werg planning
to loot the houses of hacienda
owners and warehouses in Umin¬
gan and neighboring municipal¬
ities. Hacienda Esperanza eni¬
braces the whole town of
Umingan and Sta. Maria.

Rocafol surveyed the land for the

N LAVERY with its attendant
discontent, hunger, and priv¬
 ation, is tightening its grip
on the laboring masses of Central
Luzon. Five years ago the same
place was the hotbed of the colo¬
rum organization which exacted a
heavy toll of life. Blood may
again flow any moment now if the
government does not probe into
the roots of the virtual state of
serfdom in the provinces of Rizal,
Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Bu¬
lacan.
A Different Central Luzon
There was a time when Central
Luzon was known as the “rice
granary of the Philippines." Now
the mention of that region brings
to mind lawlessness and Sakdalism.
Why this change? The people
have become tired appealing to the
government for help against the
unjust practices of landowners un¬
der whom they are working vir-
tually as slaves. They have de¬
cided to take the law in their
hands.
Figures compiled by the bureau
of labor indicate that there are 58,-
771 men and 15,152 women who
are at present trapped in the ten¬


ancy system of the Central Luzon
provinces. In Bulacan there are
7,360 minors; 3,604 in Pampanga;
and 12,961 in Nueva Ecija who are
included in the grip of this tenancy
system. From the look of things


now, these people and their des¬
cendants will forever be held as
virtual slaves.
Government Does Nothing
The government has done noth-


ing to remedy this social disorder
except send soldiers to prevent
bloodshed. Atty. Jose R. Abalos,
spokesman for the disgruntled ten¬
ants in Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, pre¬

For Roosevelt, Unanimous Endorsement
GARNER AGAIN HIS RUNNINNG MATE


FrHE democratic party, with
Franklin D. Roosevelt and
 john Nance Garner as can¬
didates for president and vice
kpresident, respectively, will face
the electorate of the United States
in the November elections on a
platform advocating a change in
the constitution, if necessary, to
solve economic and social prob¬
lems.
The Democratic national conven¬
tion, shortly after midnight of
June 26th, renominated President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt unani¬
mously. Vice President John Nance
Garner, who visited Manila last
November, was nominated as the
President’s running mate.
Not a single negative voice was
heard when Senator Joseph T. Rob-
inson, permanent chairman of the
convention, took the platform and
called, "All in favor say aye.” A
mighty roar of approval answered
him. The weary delegates waved
flags and paraded with state ban¬
ners for fifteen minutes.
President Roosevelt accepted the
renomination on June 27th with a
challenge to “economic royalists.”
He told a hysterical crowd exceed¬
ing 100,000 persons, gathered at
Franklin Field: “I accept the com-
mission you tendered me. I join
with you. I am enlisted for the
duration of the war.” The Pres-
ident launched his campaign for re¬
election with caustic criticism of
the “economic royalists” who, he
said, "forget what the flag and the
constitution stand for.” "What
they really complain of,” he conti¬

away their power. Our allegiance
to American institutions requires
that we overthrow this kind of
power. Vainly they seek to hide
behind the constitution and flag,
blindly forgetting that the flag and
the constitution now as always
stands for democracy, not tyranny,
freedom, not subjection, against
dictatorship, mob rule and over¬
privileged alike.”

“I second the

Roosevelt."
Every seat under the Philippine
standard was, according to press
dispatches, vacant when Roosevelt
was acclaimed as the Democratic
party’s standard bearer. Major
W. H. Anderson, head of the W. H.
Anderson firm here, and who was
to have made the seconding speech
in behalf of the delegates from the
Philippines, failed to show up.
Other Philippine delegates already
had left the city or decided that the
ordeal of listening to the long
speeches was not worth the effort.
American High Commissioner Mur¬
phy came from the Michigan sec-
tion when he delivered his eight-
word speech.
May Amend Constitution
The unanimously approved plat-
form of the party declares that
the government has these func-
tions—one, protection of the fami¬
ly and the home; two, establish-
ment of democratic opportunity
for all of the people; and three,
aid to those overtaken by disas¬
ter. The praatrorm—tates that if


“these prob¬
lems cannot
be solved by
1 e g islation
within the
constitution"
t h e party
promises to
seek a “cla¬
rify in g
a m en d ¬
ment."
The mon¬
etary plank
makes no
mention of
gold or sil¬
ver but urges
for "perman¬
ently sound
currency, so
stabilized as
to prevent
former wide
flu ctuations
in value.” It
asserts that
the U. S. to¬
day has the
soundest cur¬
rency in the
world. The
agricultu raI
pla n k de¬
clares: “We
have taken
Roosevelt: renominated un- farmers off
the road to
ruin" and
says that tillers of the soil no longer
are suffering from low prices; their
indebtedness has been reduced;
their net income doubled.
Vigorous Enforcement
It further promises to vigorous¬
ly and fearlessly enforce anti-trust
laws and to write new ones if ne¬
cessary. It advocates extending
the civil service merit system
to all non-policy making positions
in the Federal service. It pledges
against entangling foreign al¬
liances as "a guard against being
drawn by political commitments,
international banking and private
trading, into any war.”
The Philippines figured in the
convention when Senator J. Ha¬
milton Lewis of Illinois, appearing
before the platform committee is¬
sued a statement strongly opposing
Philippine independence. Lewis,
who returned from an extended
tour abroad, demanded that the
U.S. take action “to correct the
blunder of voting the Islands in¬
dependence."
The proposed plank in the Dem-
ocratic platform advocating "fair
play” for the Philippines was
omitted by the resolutions com-
mittee. American High Commis¬


sioner Murphy had a hand in the
deliberations of that committee.
Commissioner Murphy had the
unique distinction of representing
both the Philippines and Michigan
in the convention.
The convention opened at Phila¬
delphia Tuesday last week. The
day before it opened, it was threat¬
ened with discord when an open
revolt against the nomination of
Roosevelt, led by Al Smith, was
announced. The anti-Roosevelt
drive was launched in New York.
Its sponsors included Al Smith,
former Senator James A. Reed, and
former Secretary of State B.
Colby. The drive did not prosper.
On the first day of the conven¬
tion, the delegates heard National
Committee Chairman James A. Far¬
ley praise the "new deal" and its
chieftain, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The opening session of the conven¬
tion trained its guns upon the Re¬
publican nominees, Landon and
Knox. Farley roused the delegates
to their feet as he lambasted ene¬
mies of the administration, was
given a special ovation when he
said that the "processes of recov¬
ery, initiated and carried on by
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, shall
not be interrupted.”

When shortly after the election
of President Roosevelt in Novem¬
ber, 1932, an attempt on his life
was made at Miami, Florida, the
attempt resulting in the death of
the then Mayor Anton J. Cermak
of Chicago, the whole people of the
United States were genuinely
shocked. The newly elected U. S.
president was then looked up to
as a savior, one who could do mi¬
racles which would pull the coun¬
try out of economic chaos. But
that was almost four years ago.
While the President is probably
still considered the savior of the
country by the majority of Amer¬
icans, a minority, a potent one be¬
cause of the wealth it controls,
considers him an arch enemy, one,
it is incredible to believe as the
following article reveals, this hat-
red-crazed minority will only be
too glad to see die or otherwise
disposed of. What follows is an
excerpt from They Hate Roosevelt
by Marquis W. Childs, Harper’s
(May, 1936).
RESIDENT of Park Avenue
in New York City was sen¬
A tnced not long ago to a
term of imprisonment for threat¬
ening violence to the person of
President Roosevelt. This episode
in itself was unimportant. Cranks
with wild ideas are always to be
found here and there in any large
community. Yet it was significant
as a dramatically extreme mani¬
festation of one of the most extra¬
ordinary phenomena of our day:
the fanatical hatred of the Pres¬
ident which to-day obsesses thou¬
sands of men and women among
the American upper class.
No other word than hatred will
do. It is a passion, a fury, that is
wholly unreasoning. It is a con¬
suming personal hatred of Pres¬
ident Roosevelt and, to an almost
equal degree, of Mrs. Roosevelt.
Hate Confined To Upper Class
It permeates, in greater or less
degree, the whole upper stratum
of American society. It has be¬
come with many persons an idee
five. One encounters it over and
over again in clubs, even in pure¬
ly social clubs, in locker and card
rooms. At luncheon parties, over
dinner tables, it is an incessant
theme. And frequently in conver¬
sation it takes a violent and un¬
lawful form, the expression of de¬
sires and wishes that can be ex¬
plained only, it would seem, in
terms of abnormal psychology.
In history this hatred may well
go down as the major irony of our
time. For the extraordinary fact
is that whereas the fanatic who
went to prison had lost his fortune
and, therefore, had a direct griev¬
ance, the majority of those who
rail against the President have to
a large extent had their incomes
restored and their bank balances
replenished since the low point of
March, 1933.
That is what makes the pheno¬
menon so incredible. It is diffi¬
cult to find a rational cause for


Consuming persanal hatred for the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt permeates
the upper stratum of American society.
Shawn above are Mrs. Roosevelt, the
President, and one of his sons.
this hatred. I do not mean, of
course, that it is difficult to find
a rational cause for criticism,
even passionately strong criticism,
of the New Deal. One may quite
reasonably be convinced that its
policies are unsound, that its lead-
ers are hypocritical, that its total
influence is pernicious. But the
venom to which I refer is of a sort
seldom found among men and wo¬
men who have not been personally
hurt, and badly hurt, by those
whom they excoriate.
No Reason For Hate
Some members of this class
have undoubted grounds for feel¬
ing personally hurt. Some, for ex¬
ample, have found themselves with
income still depleted, and have
warrant for attributing the still
sorry state of their investments to
various measures sponsored by the
Administration. Yet others have
prospered exceedingly since March,
1933; and certainly on the average
they find their present circum-
stances much improved.
That there is a widespread con¬
viction among the wealthy that
they are being butchered to make
a Roman holiday for the less for¬
tunate is undeniable. But it is
certain that as a class the wealthy
have suffered relatively less than
any other from the economic
events of the past three years;
and in that single word relatively
there is a world of meaning. As
for their feeling that butchery has
at least been intended by the
Roosevelt administration, let us
glance for a moment at some opi¬
nions from the other side of the
fence.
A great many liberals, and cer¬
tainly all radicals, complain that
President Roosevelt’s chief mission
has been to save the fortunes of

The charges, according to Pres¬

when it is considered that some¬
time ago he had already been sus¬
pended from office as a result of

for his removal from the service."

that Presidential wrath is

with misconduct. Such wrath, de-
monstrated in the form of suspen¬
sion for a number of functiona¬
ries, came lashing down last week.
Director Fajardo
Foremost among those suspended
by Presidential order last week was
Director Jacobo Fajardo of the
bureau of health.
Dr. Fajardo and his family, ac¬
cording to the executive order of
President Quezon, exploited leper

Antero Azana by selling
him an insurance policy,
jewelry, subscriptions to
newspapers, and certain
privileges in Culion. He
permitted according to the
order, "members of his
family to obtain financial
advantages from the said
leper; including the sale of
an insurance policy by his
son, the indirect sale of
jewelry by his wife, and
the obtaining of contribu¬
tions from said leper for
newspaper subscriptions for
the purpose of getting votes
for his daughter in a
n ews paper Popularity
Contest; and has furthermore
received certain sums of mo¬
ney from the said leper in con-
sideration of certain undue privi¬
leges granted by him as Director
of Health.”
Likewise, he is being charged
with having made improper use of
his influence over Mrs. Evarista
Vda. de Roque, widow of a former
subordinate, for the purpose of in¬
ducing her to part with the retire¬
ment pay received by her upon the
death of her husband. Director Fa¬
jardo has also failed to account for
the funds of the Health Officers”
Association, which the treasurer
turned over to him in 1927 although
the organization is already defunct.


Governor Generoso


Found guilty on all counts in
the administrative complaint filed
against him, another official, Gov-
ernor Sebastian T. Generoso was
suspended from office for two
months beginning last Thursday,
June 25th.
The Davao governor was charged
with the following, as specified in
the Quezon suspension order:
“Conduct unbecoming a public
official in that he had been habit-

and social functions under the in¬
fluence of liquor, and regularly vis¬
iting in her room in the Awad

bailarina who is reputed to be his
mistress, during office hours; of
meddling and unduly interfering in
the assignments of members of the
municipal police vice squad of Da¬
vao despite the warning by the de-
partment of the interior not to do
so, thus giving rise to suspicion
that he is protecting gambling dens
and prostitution houses in the muni¬
cipality; of unduly influencing,
through threats, members of the
municipal council of Davao to pass
resolutions and ordinances accord¬

"IIl take this to court," says an
irate disputant and he does and
clogs the court dockets further
with cases which can easily be
settled out of court.
Many disputes, if not all, can
be disposed of amicably without
benefit of judicial review if only
disputants agree to meet each
other half-way; if parties to a
quarrel are willing to air their
grievances before friends an d
abide by their counsel. If this were
possible, you would say, it would
be ideal, but unfortunately, you
will add with knowing air, we are
still a long way from the ideal.
But it is possible. Out there in
a Pangasinan town, they have an
informal court which is function¬
ing as the article below describes.
Why cannot the same work in
other towns?
WAVE you ever heard of a “Juz¬
AA gado Rural”? Have you ever
seen a trial conducted in this
court? If you have not, then you
are missing a lot, for in this court
you will see and hear an old and all
but forgotten way of settling dis¬
putes.
Now, just what is this "Juzgado
Rural”? To the townfolk of Urda¬
neta, Pangasinan, it is an ordinary
court—a rural court of justice.
Urdaneta’s town president, Attor¬
ney W. G. Ambrosio, organized it
last January, 1935. The court is di¬
rectly supervised by Dr. Lorenzo
Pangalangan, also called “El Secre¬
tario Supremo y Director de Juz¬
gado Rural," by friends and asso¬
ciates.
Other Members
The officers of the court are Ju¬
nior Clerk Teotimo Hermosa,
judge; Mr. Andres Tamayo, fiscal;
ex-Vice President Hugo Zabala,
clerk of court; and Messrs. H. Is¬
rael and Arsadon, interpreters.
The attorneys of the court that
usually handle the prosecution are
ex-Vice President Jose Angud, Mu¬
nicipal Clerk Eliseo de Aguinaldo,


Agapito Enriquez, Blas Abriam,
and Antonino Benito. They are
not full-fledged lawyers, neverthe¬
less they know their legal duties
because of their wide experience in
public affairs.
This court charges no fees be¬
cause it has been established main¬
ly to help poor people. Except for
tips or drinks, usually given by
town President Ambrosio and Dr.
Pangalangan, all officers of the
court and its attorneys serve with-
out compensation.
Minor Cases Decided
The cases handled by this court
are minor ones, such as cases re¬
garding disputes of boundaries, of
dikes, quarrels between husband
and wife, slander, slight physical
injuries, and others of lesser im¬
port.
At this writing, the court has de-
cided about a dozen cases, the de¬
cision in all being in the nature of
compromises. Surprising also, all
litigants accept the judgment of
this court as final.
How Court Works
When a minor case is brought
before the municipal president, he
immediately investigates it. If in
his opinion the case does not fall
within the jurisdiction of the jus¬
tice of the peace court (the muni¬
cipal president is an attorney), he
advises the aggrieved party to en¬
ter into a compromise, he acting as
mediator. If the complainant refus¬
es to follow his advice, he brings
the court to the juzgado rural.
The president informs the rural
court judge, the latter in turn no¬
tifies the officers of the court, the
pseudo-attorneys, the parties liti¬
gants, giving the date and hour
and place of trial. The trials are
usually held Saturday and Sunday
afternoons, so that officers of the
court who happen to be govern¬
ment employees may also be pre¬
sent in court.
Trial at Session Hall

old child enrolling in the first grade

High School Graduate At 12
At the age of 6 a child can be ad-
mitted to the first grade if he is
larger than his age and the first
grade classes have not been filled,
according to the bureau of educa¬
tion. Children at the age of 5 have
actually enrolled in the primary
schools. One of these is Miss Jose¬
fina R. Ticzon, mentioned earlier
in this article. Miss Ticzon’s five
brothers and one sister were like¬
wise all enrolled in the first grade
at the age of 5. Of course they
told their right ages when nothing
could be done about it.

child who enrolls at the age of 5
to be a high school graduate at 12.
It has not been done here yet, but
that does not mean it can’t be done.
A cursory reading of the biogra¬
phies of prominent Filipinos, how-
ever, will make one think that stu¬
dents during the Spanish regime
graduated earlier than the few ex¬
ceptions we have to-day. Why, dur-
ing the good old days it was not
rare to find a 16-year-old youth
sporting an A.B.! Dr. Rafael Pal¬
ma, for instance, was only 16 when
he got his Bachiller en Artes. Judge
Antonio Horilleno, Dr. Baldomero
Roxas, and Atty. Eulogio P. Revi¬
lla are among the many other Fili¬
pinos who got their A.B.’s at the


y T won’t be long now before
professors will be threatening
Ato spank college freshies if
they (the freshies, we mean) per¬
sist in spinning their tops in the
college corridors and playing pa¬
tintero in the campus.


According to records in the Uni¬
versity of the Philippines, the ave¬
rage age of freshmen in that insti¬
tution is 18 this semester. Ten
years ago, it was 19; fifteen years
ago, 20; twenty years ago, 21. If
this keeps up at the same rate, by
1956 the average age of freshies in
college will be 15. And why not?


In College At Fourteen
"Way back in 1932, Francisco
Carillo enrolled in the U.P. college
of engineering at the tender age of
14 years and 8 months. He was not
a lone exception by any means, as
during that same year Elvira N.
Fermin, a young girl from Taguig,
Rizal, enrolled in the college of li¬
beral arts of the same university at
the more tender age of 14 years
and 3 months! She was only 11
when she enrolled in the U.P. High,
from which she graduated.

scholar, will be just 21 when she is

awarded her M.D. degree. The
youngest to graduate from the
U.P. college of medicine last March,
Miss Josefina R. Ticzon, was only
22. From the pontifical university
the youngest to get his M.D. degree
last school year was on.y 21. And
to think that some 15 years ago
twenty-year-olds were plodding
through the primary grades.
Not The Limit Yet
A 14-year-old freshman in col¬
lege is not the limit yet. An ex¬
ceptionally bright student may be a
college student at the age of 13 or
even 12. Impossible? Let us prove
it mathematically.
There used to be a time when a
pupil had to squeeze himself
through the primary grades in 4
years, and no less than that. If one
was not very bright he had to do it
in 5 years as he had to hurdle the
first grade in 2 years: one for
grade I-B and another for grade
I-A.
The intermediate grades could be
gone through in 3 years, the high
school in 4 years. That means the
best a pupil could do was 11 years
from the primary to the last year
in the high school. If a child went
to school at the age of seven, he
was 18 when he graduated from the
high school. And although you
were actually seven if you could not
touch your left ear by reaching for
it across the top of your head with
the right hand, you would not have
been admitted.
Now the primary grades can be
negotiated in 2 years, as one acce¬
leration a year is permissible. The
Cintermediate school can be gone
through in 2 years also. In 3 years

age of 16.
Dr. Jose Rizal had his A.B. at 15.
Judge Marcelo Boncan and ex-Dir.
Simeon Ramos had theirs also at
the same age.
Shorter Courses Then
It is an impossibility now to be
awarded the degree of A.B. at the
age of 16. In the first place the
Bachiller en Artes was not a col¬
lege degree. A high school gra¬
duate who passed the revalida
(general examinations in all the
high school subjects) shortly after
graduation was given that title.
Besides that, the courses were
shorter. The clase elemental which
corresponds to our primary school
was only a 2-year course. This was
followed by the clase complimenta¬
ria (1 year) and then the segunda
ensenanza (4 years) which corres¬
ponds to our high school. Where it
took 7 years to complete the ele¬
mentary and high schools then, it
takes 11 years ordinarily now.
There were no preparatory cours¬
es in medicine and law, too, dur¬
ing those days. The University of
Sto. Tomas was the only institution
here which offered law in four
years. All the others, such as the
Escuela de Derecho de Manila and


Same university students. Future col¬
legians will not prabably be as old as
these.


the La Jurisprudencia, gave 3-year
courses in law. It was not a diffi¬
cult feat then to be a law graduate
at the age of 21. Judge Manuel V.!
Moran graduated with honors from
the Escuela de Derecho at the age
of 20. Judge Pedro Ma. Sison ac¬
tually got his LL.B. from the same
law school when he was 19.
Something Looks Awry
But it is paradoxical that while
the average age of college students
is steadily on the descent, the per¬
centage of married students in the
state institution is climbing up.
Thus during the first semester of
last school year, out of the 4,565
students in the purely collegiate de¬
partments of the university—such
departments as the school of fine
arts, school of nursing, and the
conservatory of music are not in
the classification—199 (or 4.35%)
(Continued on page 14)


UT there in Karachi, India,
able, plucky Filipino Bird¬
men Antonio Arnaiz and
Juan Calvo are at this writing
poised for the next hop in their
Manila-Madrid flight, poised for
several days, in fact, but can¬
not take to the air because Shah
Mirza Reza Pahlevi's Iranian
(Persian) government has not
seen fit, so far, to give Birdmen
Arnaiz and Calvo the necessary
permit to fly over Iranian terri¬
tory.
Now just why is it taking the
Shah of Iran such a long time to
give the necessary permit? Or is
he ever giving such permit at all?
Here is a little story that may
explain just why Shah Mirza Reza
Pahlevi is taking sweet time about
the permit. And it seems the ap-
peal to the U. S. department of
state made by the Commonwealth
government in behalf of Calvo and
Arnaiz may even make matters
worse for the simple reason that
recently the Shah got so hopping
mad about the U. S. A. he or¬
dered the closing of the Iranian
legation and consulates in America.
The Shah got mad because one day
last November, according to a
Time account, his Envoy Extra¬
ordinary and Minister Plenipoten¬
tiary to the U. S., Ghaffar Khan
Dialal, took it into his head to go
motoring with his English wife.
Out there in Elkton, Maryland,
they do not like speeding, and how
cculd the constable know that the
car tearing down the road had the
Iranian envoy and his wife inside?
The envoy was incensed when he


Antonio Arnaiz, left, and Juan Calvo:
delayed in their flight to Madrid, Spain.


was stopped, must have flourished
diplomatic immunity and all that,
and the constable not caring or fail¬
ing to comprehend was not con¬
vinced and the envoy "struck aside
the constable.” Then the constable,
on his own account got mad, fished
for his manacles, snapped them on
the envoy’s wrists. The justice of
the peace before whom the envoy
was hauled saw the mess the cons¬
table did, released the envoy. An
official apology from the governor
followed, also dismissal for the
constable ("later stealthily re¬
hired"), but Shah Mirza Reza Pah¬
levi was far from being satisfied,
ordered the Iranian Washington
legation and all consulates in U. S.
padlocked.


Mirza Reza Pahlevi, shah of Persia,
over whase country Aviators Arnaiz and
Calva cannot fly for lack of permit.


Now what has this falling out
between Iran (the Shah gets mighty
angry if you call his country Per¬
sia) and the U. S. to do with the
present difficulties of Aviators
Arnaiz and Calvo?
We ask: might it not be that be¬
cause Arnaiz and Calvo are Filipi¬
nos and are thus U. S. ruled, the
Shah is just trying to even up
scores for humiliating the Shah’s
envoy at Elkton? Perhaps not, but
you never can tell, this is a funny
world.

IBANAG MOONSHINERS-
REVENLE MEN FAREBADLY
AGAINST BOOTLEGGERS
By JULIO L. LIQUIGAN


CAAA


From nipa palms Ibanag moonshiners get their raw produet for the manufacture of hannawag, a native liquor made on the
sly. Superimposed in the above photo is a shetch of a crude distillery.


B ANNAWAG,” to Ilocandia
may mean a most popu¬
Dlar Ilocano weekly; but
to the moonshine section of north-
ern Luzon, more particularly the
coastal region between the Cara¬
ballo mountains and the mouth of
the Cagayan river, the word, spe¬
cially when uttered in hushed
tones, may also mean a favorite
drink of amber liquor made, with-
out benefit of official sanction by
the bureau of internal revenue,
out of the fermented sap of the ni¬
pa palm. This word is the most
up-to-date of the many odd names
with which the moonshiners of
the municipality of Abulug, in
the province of Cagayan, refer to
their outlaw product.
Center of Trade
Abulug is the center of the hooch
trade up North, and only the Iba¬
nags who compose merely one-third
of the eight thousand souls in that
municipality are engaged in this
illicit trade. Raids, heavy fines,
and long jail terms hold no terror
for these Ibanags who have learn¬
ed to love the nipa swamps in
which their ancestors sought re¬
fuge from the oppressive hand of
Spanish rule. Making booze is just
as natural to these folk as cultivat¬
ing palay is to the Ilocanos. They
were born to the trade, and it is in
their blood. They love the compa¬
rative life of ease which requires
them to work only from two o’clock
in the morning until sunrise, ga¬
thering the tuba which their wives
or daughters “cook" in crude
stoves so carefully concealed either


underground or in inaccessible nooks
in the nipa swamps. These people
are ostensibly either farmers or
fishermen in the daytime, but at
night their houses in town are ve¬
ritable speak-easies where "Banna¬
wag” is sold to regular customers,
and nobody else.


An Ibanag, out of gallantry, sometimes
volunteers to ge to jail instead of a poor
neighbor with many children.


Cooperation
The Ibanag moonshiner has long
since learned the wisdom of Lin¬
coln’s “United we stand, divided we
fall.” To the casual observer, he
operates his still alone; but if he
gave you the low down on his
trade, which he seldom does even to
his own brother, he would tell you
he belongs to such and such a socio,
meaning a vague, loose organization
bound by no written constitution' or
by-laws, and held together only by
the compelling bond of mutual fear
of the law. There are no pointed
agreements, to be sure, but the bro¬


therhood’s unwritten laws have a
more binding force than the Ten
Commandments.
Medicine for Squealers
Woe unto the brother who "snit-
ches”! These moonshiners wreak
vengeance slowly but surely, and
with a finesse peculiarly their
own. For instance, when the
treacherous brother is definitely
identified, his pigs, his carabaos,
and his dogs are injured, or are
caught, and then tied to a tree in
the nipa jungles. Unless found in
time by the owner they will die of
starvation. His fish traps are hack-
ed to pieces at night, and his only
canoe which he uses in gathering
the tuba and in going to town, is
set adrift. His chickens mys-
teriously disappear. But the per¬
son of the erring brother is not
touched. On the contrary, he is
treated by his very persecutors just
as nicely and as sweetly as if no¬
thing had ever happened. They will
even go so far as to lend him a
hand mending his fences and the
roof of his hut. Finally, when
enough punishment has been in¬
flicted, a convenient rustic gather¬
ing is made the occasion for a
drinking bout with him and then
a sort of “third degree," consisting
of suggestive toasts is perpetrated,
which generally end in lachrymal
scenes and reconciliation.


“Official” Jailbird
When a member’s still is raided,
his fine is prorated among his con¬
freres. If a jail sentence is impos¬
ed, a previously designated person
goes forward and claims ownership
of the paraphernalia used in the
manufacture of the outlaw beve¬
rage. This willing "goat” is gen¬
erally some ne er-do-well who does
not mind boarding free at the pro¬
vincial calaboose. Or some gallant
son of the swamps who feels an
urge to help out a poor neighbor
with many little mouths to feed.
But even if this organized resist-
ance to internal revenue laws les¬
sens somewhat the "Bannawag”
trafficker’s fear of the law, the re-
venue officers frequently put up
spurts of activity and succeed in
eluding the vigilance of the "Ban-
nawag” men and a battle royal is
staged in the boggy marshes in
which the government men, dealing
with desperate creatures, invari¬
ably come out second best. The
“Bannawag” is the only source of
income for these simple folk, and
interfering with their only means
of livelihood no matter how legal
the interference may be could not
be expected to be a very healthful
form of exercise.

affairs. Each combine or organi¬
zation ranges from a three-family
to a twenty-seven family affair.
These combines maintain a system
of espionage that is hard to beat.
Every move by the “G-men" is
watched, and by a system of sig-
nals, and by means of swift cour¬
iers, the most distant part of the
swamp region smells the impending
raid long before the revenue men
get started on their errand.
Up to about thirty years ago,
when the present restrictions in the
manufacture of distilled spirits
have not yet crippled the "Banna¬
wag" industry, Abulug, rivalling
the seaport of Aparri, used to be
the financial center of northern Ca¬
gayan. The greater bulk of the ni¬
pa region of the Cagayan Valley is
located within the boundaries of
that municipality, and all the wealth
of the tobacco growing sections of
this vast territory flowed down the
Cagayan river into Abulug, and
brought about a tremendous pros¬
perity which present day Abulugue¬
nos still recall with pride. It is
said that the evident more advanc-
ed culture and enlightenment of
the Ibanag element of the northern
Cagayan valley is eloquent testimo¬
ny to this departed financial glory.
According to the older inhabitants,
this town in its heyday when steam-
er travel was an expensive luxury,
had been able to send more students
to Manila than all the other towns
of the Cagayan Valley combined.
Industry Hard To Kill
President Quezon, in pepping up
revenue collections, and the cabinet
in approving in principle the po¬
licy of the Bureau of Internal Re¬
venue to increase its field force,
have rendered the prospect of the
Abulug “Bannawag” trafficker ve¬
ry unrosy. The revenue bureau has
stationed a sub-district office in
Abulug, in order to deal more ef¬
fectively with the illicit liquor
traffic. Abulug, however, claims
that even if Director Yatco should
move the entire force of his bureau
to that municipality, as long as a

 T is bad enough for Arabs to
take pot-shots at British pro¬
I
tected Jews in Palestine. Arab
sniping at British troops is, of
course, considerably worse.
Either because the Arabs do not
like British interference when they
go Jew-hunting or that they do not
like the Tommies, anyway, is hard
to figure out, but it is a fact that
last week Arab snipers hid in caves

the stuff is being imbibed by the
best people: by high government
officials, merchants, preachers, and
school teachers, and the medicinal
properties claimed for this convivial
liquid are many and varied. The
young ladies of the Valley attribute
their buxomness and the richness
of their complexion to it. With
such aristocratic patronage and
proven merits it is reasonable to
expect that the "Bannawag" in
spite of the law, and for some time
to come, will continue to delight
tipplers in northern Luzon.

came within range the Arabs start-

selves poor shots, bagging only one
British soldier. The Tommies fir¬

Arabs.
It was also reported that Arabs

voy, wounding three British sol-
diers.

VACATION DAYS ARE OVER
By ESPERANZA PURA GALENZOGA


For some students, pacation is often spoiled by relatives mhose presence in their
homes means meals prepared extra well, more dishes washed, and more elothes cleaned.


The old adage about one man’s
meat being likely another man’s
poison holds true also with vaca¬
tions. To many students, vaca¬
tions signify fun and freedom.
But there are not a few who
would rather endure the drudgery

were married.
Five years previous (1930), out
of the 5,650 in the same colleges,
215 were married. (At least, 215
admitted they were married.) While
that is numerically higher, it rep¬
resents only 3.8% of the sum to¬
tal.
It is interesting to note that out
of the 199 married students in
1935, 49 were women (24.6%),
while in 1930 the 215 who were
married included 28 women (13%).
The percentage of women married
has within the last five years in¬
creased almost twice. Evidently, if
this seemingly paradoxical increase
of married students is due to the
reluctance of certain parties to ad¬
mit that they were non-negotiable
five years ago, then it must be the
women who had been fibbing. Or
is the logic awry too?
Married or not married, however,
it is a fact that boys who have
barely graduated from short pants,
and girls who still wear pigtails
are flocking into universities in
greater and greater numbers eve¬

of classroom work than stay at
home as the following article
shows.
WAS not very disposed to give
a whoop of welcome when June
—came around this year. The
end of vacation has always meant
to me the end of picnics and out¬
ings and parties, of “overtimes" in
my warm bed; the start of head¬
bursting lessons and monotonous
lectures. Naturally I expected
others to share my feelings.
They Hate Vacations
At the first opportunity that
presented itself, therefore, I wailed
out to a group of classmates some¬
thing about vacation not having
been long enough.
I was not prepared to hear so
many begging to disagree. "Huh?'
retorted a much amazed girl in the
group. “So you actually love va¬
cations, eh? If you only knew what
I went through the past two
months!'
And this classmate of mine re-
lated how when she and her three
sisters had barely begun enjoying
the summer vacation, the Mianos
came from the South. “They were
a couple with three kids,” she said,
visibly shuddering as if it had been
a nightmare. “The head of the
family said he was suffering from
some kind of bone trouble and had
come to our province for a vacation.
I could very well see that, but why
they had to pick us out to stay with,
I have never been able to figure out
satisfactorily.
“Claiming kinship with us be¬
cause their great-grandmother was
a third cousin to the brother-in¬
law of our great-grandfather, they
were of course welcomed with the
traditional Filipino hospitality.
Come to think of it, we never real¬
ly knew them; rather, they never
knew us till the bone trouble came."
A Complete Nuisance
To the hosts—especially to the
children in the family—the visit of
the Mianos meant meals had to be
prepared extra well, more dishes
had to be washed, more clothes
had to be cleaned. That was bad
enough but the children of the Mia¬
nos were pests. “We had to stand


by while they ruined the furni¬
ture,” this classmate of mine recit¬
ed. “We had to play carabao while
they rode on our backs, and when
they brought their mud-laden shoes
into the sala, we had to declare
they were very cute.
“They left us only last week, af¬
ter which Mother told us the fami¬
ly coffers had been so drained we
might have to prolong our vacation
by a whole year if we couldn’t


sense of humor and a sharp tongue can do
a lot to mahe one hate pacation time.
scrape up some money for tuition
fees."
Another girl declared that at¬
tending classes is indeed a happy
change for her. “I could classify
any plant in our botany textbook,”


she said, "and define such terms
as pteridophyta, but I couldn’t get
all this 'knowledge” to help me
make a salad just right for Tia
Maria. I was therefore kept toeing
the mark at the stove most of the
time. Am I not glad classes have
begun?”
“I too vacationed with an aunt,”
chimed in a third girl. “Tia Adela
belongs to the conservative kind,
very much noted for her sharp
tongue, a caustic sense of humor,
and a chronic antagonism for any¬
thing new. To please the old lady,
I had to wear my loose dresses of
four years ago, comb my hair se¬
all that sort of thing. Now I can’t
look a powder puff straight in the
eye.”
Had to Endure Widower's
Love Making
"And I," sighed a dreamy-eyed
young lady, who is the class senti¬
mentalist, “had to endure the love
making of a widower old enough to
be my father. He did our family
some favors in the past, so Mother
was always reminding me to pay
attention to my manners."
This girl had to keep her face
straight while the unwelcome wi¬
dower knelt before her and poured
forth what he thought were love ly-
rics. “I had to stifle my yawns at
his boresome conversation," she
said, "while his mouth that smelt
strongly of tobacco and tuba was
the only thing that kept me awake.
Am I not glad June is at last
around?"

rough adherence to the merit
system in the hiring of govern¬
ment employees.
No other government office has
less prestige, is taken less seriously,
and abused more by government
employees and public alike as the
Bureau of Civil Service. Designed
to give the country a corps of effi¬
cient, deserving, independent work¬
ers, it has succeeded only in giving
an army of listless public servants,
believing more in the efficacy of
political and social connections than
in sheer merit in matters of ap¬
pointments and promotions, jealous
of each other, more concerned in
petty office politics, interested more
in playing into the good graces of
the chiefs than in doing their
duties as they should be done.
And under present circumstances,
that is, under the rules and condi¬
tions in which the Bureau is forced


Director Jose Gil of the bureau
of civil service: to get rank of under¬
secretary.


to function, it cannot do any bet¬
ter. It has the status of a second-
class bureau and is treated as such.
It is no more than a sort of glori¬
fied messenger and rubber stamp
for the other bureaus who always
want the Bureau of Civil Service
to appoint men of their own choice
notwithstanding civil service re-
gulations.
It is a common complaint for ex¬
ample that the civil service con¬
testant who obtains the highest
rating in the examinations does not
often get the job. One may be at
the foot of the eligible list, but if
he knows the right people he gets
the first job ahead of the top-
notchers, the best job if there are
a number of positions to pick from,
and naturally the best salary. This
may be somewhat exaggerated, but


President Quezon: elevates bureau of
civil service.


there have been so many complaints
of this nature that it is not impos¬
sible to be'ieve that somehow there
is something to these complaints.
The elevation of the Bureau of
Civil Service to Civil Service Com-
mission is accompanied by an en¬
largement of its functions. It will
be in “charge of, and pass upon all
formal investigations against of¬
ficers and employees of the Civil
Service.” And this additional func-
tion has been given to the Commis¬
sion because, to quote the Presid-
ent, "experience has demonstrated
that sometimes the esprit de corps
in a given bureau is so strong that
complaints presented by private
parties against employees of the
bureau do not receive due consider¬
ation; on the other hand, there are
cases where for personal, political
or other reasons, employees are not
properly protected in their rights."
The Bureau of Civil Service
elevated, the administrative officers
of the office move up the govern¬
ment service rungs, the head of the
new office to sport the name of
Commissioner of Civil Service with
the rank of under-secretary and his
assistant, to be known as Deputy
Commissioner of Civil Service, with
the rank of assistant director of a
first class bureau, with correspond-
ing salaries.
The civil service reform initiated
by the President includes a Civil
Service Board of Appeals which
shall pass judgment upon appeals


Assistant Director Amado del Rosa¬
rio: will be known as deputy commis¬
sioner of civil service with the ranh of
assistant director of a first class bureau.


to the decisions handed by the com-
missioner. The board of appeals
will be composed of the auditor gen¬
eral, chairman; the solicitor gen¬


eral, and the director of the bud¬
get as members. The board’s de-
cision is final.

Mindanao Commission Functioning In Mindanao,
Not Manila, Favored


Felipe I. Tolentino: favors ereation of
the Mindango Commission.
Since the inception of civil rule
in Mindanao, two distinct systems
of control have been tried in that
island: the Department of Minda¬
nao and Sulu system, and the pre¬
sent Bureau of Non-Christain
Tribes which superseded the first.
But while on the whole either sys¬
tem cannot be said to be an entire
failure, it is a fact, nevertheless,
that Mindanao can be governed
more efficiently. Proof of this is
the national government’s own de¬
cision to introduce changes in the
administration of the island. The
Mindanao Commission, favored by
the writer of the article below, has
been planned to take the place of
the Bureau of Non-Christian
Tribes.
COMMISSION which will re-
place the Bureau of Non¬
Christian Tribes has been
proposed. It will tackle the social,
economic, and agricultural pro¬
blems of Mindanao which somehow,
have not been effectively solved by
previous efforts in this direction.
Practically all elements in North-
ern Mindanao hail the plan, now
under consideration of the Assem¬
bly, as an excellent step in the
right direction.
One very important feature of
the Commission plan, a feature that
bids fair to revolutionize existing
conditions in Mindanao is the pro¬
vision that the office of the Com-
missioner be situated in Zamboan¬
ga or in any Mindanao location
that is easily accessible to all the
provinces. This is very important,
it will surely bring about close
supervision of municipal and pro¬
vincial governments, especially with
respect to the realization of the po¬
licy of "more work and less poli¬


By FELIPE I. TOLENTINO
tics" as enunciated by the Pres-
ident.
The charge is welcome because,
as present conditions will prove,
there is so much of red tape in the
administration of Mindanao pro¬
vincial and local governments in
Non-Christian provinces that it
may require six months or even a
year before a quarrel, say, between
a municipal council and the office of
a municipal treasurer over trivial
matters or a misunderstanding bet¬
ween the provincial board and other
branches of the provincial govern¬
ment is settled. As under the new
plan, the Commissioner’s office will
be in Mindanao, itself, right in the
field, so to speak, worthless feuds
among offices which ordinarily
mean waste of money and the re¬
tarding of important projects for
the common welfare can be ironed
out quickly through the quick in¬
tervention of the Commissioner.
Laxity and Abuse
The Commission, doubtless, can
do a great deal towards the doing
away with leniency, laxity, and
even abuses which are being com-
mitted by many officials in many
provinces of Mindanao. An exam¬


Director Guingona: considered the
man mest htted to head the Com¬
mission intended to replace the

ple of the many laxities being com¬
mitted by government officials is
the presence unmolested of a lep-
rous boy in a town, the boy ming-
ling with school children in the
streets during school days despite
the boy’s exclusion from classes by
school authorities. For almost a
year now the boy has been allowed

The man in the above photo is Raja Muda, crown prince of Sulu, who will
likely succeed to the sultanate. Others in the picture, from the left, are Mrs¬
Muda, Sergia Rodrigo, dormitory dean; and Dayang Dayang Sitti Rada Kiram.


ILIPINOS in Christian prov-
inces regarded the death of
I Sultan Muhamad Jamalul
Kiram, only with passing interest.
Among Mohamme¬
dan Fili pinos,
however, the pass¬
ing away of the
spiritual ruler of
Sulu and one-time
senator from the
twelfth senatorial
district, the event
is of great signifi¬
Datu Umbra
can ce. For the
death of the sul¬
tan left one question over which
the Moros are sure to be divided
over. The question is:
Who shall be the next sultan
and spiritual leader of the Moham¬
medan Filipinos?
The question, up to last week, re¬
mained unanswered. Conflicting
reports have come from Sulu con¬
cerning the selection of a new sul¬
tan. One report stated that Raja
Muda, crown prince of Sulu, was
to be proclaimed sultan last June
27th, the twentieth day of the death
of Sultan Jamalul Kiram. The
Dayang Dayang, who has been act-
ing sultana since the death of the
late Sulu sultan, her uncle, has
been persuaded by Hadji Butu to
give way to Raja Muda since the
sultan of Sulu is the head of the
Islamic religion in the Philippines
and the head of Islam or high
priest can never be a woman.
A correspondent’s report last
week contained the information

that the Dayang Dayang’s consent
to the proclamation of Raja Muda
was influenced by the sudden rise
of Muda into popularity and the re-
cognition given him by the Moros.
It seems, it is said, that Moros can-
not seem to bring themselves to re¬
cognize a woman as their leader be¬
cause the Moros have antiquated
beliefs with regards to the place of
women in religion, in the govern¬
ment, and in society

and political machinations are at
work in Moroland in connection
with the selection of a new sultan.
Furthermore, Sulu Moros are
troubled over the selection of a new
crown prince of Sulu. The Dayang
Dayang, it is said, is willing to give
way only on condition that her
father-in-law, Datu Amilbangsa,
be made crown prince. On the
other hand, it is said, Datu Tam¬
buyong, former pretender to the
throne, is also willing to support
Raja Muda for the sultanate pro¬
vided Datu Buyungan, brother of
Tambuyong and husband of Prin¬

RHEUMATIC PRINS


People once had to go away for rheumatism, take min¬
eral baths, or drink medicinal waters. Then came the
first real relief—salicylates. 9 Today, there is a remedy
twice as effective as salicylates: Canaspirina. It brings im¬
mediate and effective relief from the suffering caused by
rheumatism. 9 So, don’t go through another season of
suffering, or any more “bad days" with rheumatism.
Cafiaspirina usefulness isn’t limited to headaches or colds!
It brings the same remarkable relief in
rheumatism, neuritis, lumbago, or sciatica.
And it is safe, it does not depress the heart.

BRROUWAA
By J. C. DIONISIO


NOR nine months it did not rain
4 in Nabitas and even the grass
X withered and burnt to the
ground. In the rice lands there
were wide and deep cracks, and the
soil was as hard as brick. Every¬
where the earth sounded hollow
like a drum when you tapped it
with the heel of your foot.
Every one in Nabitas suffered
from this drought, but the family
of Manso, whose story I am about
to tell you, suffered the most. There
were nine children in Manso’s fa¬
mily and Manso’s was considered
the poorest in all Nabitas. Manso


himself, the father, was around
forty, and he was very thin and
had beri-beri. His wife, Tasia, was
in contrast a husky woman, and
her breast hung loosely. Births
did not seem to affect her vitality
for she was healthy-looking after
her ninth child as she was before
her first.
At first Manso had two cara¬
baos and something like two cava¬
nes of rice land, but in the previous
drought he lost his carabaos and
also his land. He lost his carabaos
from disease and the lands to Ten¬
te Sidro, the wealthy landlord of


Nabitas. How he lost his land was
like this: Manso borrowed rice
from the landlord to feed his fa¬
mily during the famine, giving his
land as security. But Manso did
not know how to read or write, and
one day the landlord informed him
that their contract was up and he
had failed to redeem his pledge.
After that Manso, disappointed
and bitter, brooded all the time. He
did not become completely insane,
but only loco-loco as we say in the
dialect. Alone he would suddenly
burst into laughter and sometimes
he would draw his bolo and chop
trees within reach with fearful
frenzy. Another thing, too: he al¬
ways liked to talk to anybody who
would listen to him. He called these
sessions "endividir.” When he got
you interested enough he would
say, “Come on. Let’s endividir.”
And then he would rattle on, talk-
ing about many things, jumping
from one to the other without
warning. He would begin, "Now
to endividir " Then he would
follow that with a few words of
Spanish, nod his head and smile,
stroke his chin as if in deep
thought: and it would be hard to
stop him.
I never knew exactly what he
meant by “endividir" except that
when he said it you were supposed
to listen while he talked. I thought
about it a lot and it occurred to me
that when he went to settle with
Tente Sidro, the landlord impressed
him with his knowledge of arith-
metic, and when dividing always
said the Spanish terms “dividido
por" or simply “dividir. That’s
the only reason I could think of for
Manso’s constant use of "endivi¬
dir.”
Maybe you'd think that a man
does not usually get crazy over los¬
ing a piece of land, but I guess you
would become idiotic too if you
were Manso. When you consider
that it was the only rice land he
had and that he already had seven
children, you’d understand what he
was up against. The only way he
could raise rice was to rent land
and that wasn’t profitable.
In
fact, that way, the owner of the
land got more than the renter. The
landlord did not lose a cent whether
you starved or not: he would get
his share first. And being the
landlord he got more by imposing
'fines" on you for not taking good
care of his carabao, or charging
you with “stealing," or simply in¬
flating the figures in his book
which represented your debt to
him. You, the tenant, stood to lose
all around.


So when Manso lost his land he
became a new man. He changed
entirely. Whereas before he was
stern, almost cruel to his children,
now he was good-natured, good-hu¬
mored, and meek. The children of
the village liked him. At first they
listened to him seriously, but child-
ren are very observant and when
they noticed the older folks humor¬
ing Manso or openly calling him
loco-loco, they followed suit. They
ede fun of him, and sometimes a
bunch of them would chase him
in the fields and wrestle with him.
And Manso himself seemed to like
it all.
And so months passed and Man¬
so became lazy and would not work
at all. Early in the morning he
would get up and go away to the
brook with his fish net. When he
came home in the afternoon the
children would be crying for food,
but he wouldn’t come near the
house. He would sneak up his sang¬
gutan and stay there the whole
day, drinking tuba or just sitting
there calmly surveying the country-
side, while below his children
prowled around for something to
eat. It was from eating raw toad¬
stool which he found in a grassy
field that Manso’s fifth child died.
Sometimes Tasia, coming home
from her daily trips in the woods
for vegetables and edible roots,
would meet two or three of the
children far from the house. When
she arrived home with them she'd
shout curses and other indecent re¬
marks at her husband sitting on
top of his coconut tree, but she
found that useless after a while.
Manso never answered back, shout
how loud she might. So Tasia fi¬
nally left him alone and she became
the only support of the family. She
did it by stealing bananas or corn,
sometimes at high noon when eve¬
rybody was indoors for dinner or
siesta, sometimes in the dead of
night. It was during one of these
expeditions that she gave birth to
her ninth child in the woods. She
brought the baby home wrapped in
her skirt, while slung on her back
was a bundle of young corn.
One day Ora Senta, who owned
a store by the carretera, happened
to come to Nabitas and saw the
eldest of the Manso children. She
told Tasia that she needed a ser¬
vant, and Tasia was glad to let Ce¬
non go. It meant one mouth less
to feed. Cenon was fourteen then
and was muscular. Although he
worked for no wages—really a
slave—he was better off at Ora
Senta’s than at his home, everybo¬

S she came out of the main
door of the dressmaking
Aschool, Anita tossed her head
slightly and gave a short deep
breath. But there were no men
she could see, and she stood un¬
der the awning for a while, com-
pacting the bundle of paper pat¬
terns under the crook of her right
arm. Other girls came out too, in
chatting and laughing groups, but
they passed on apparently unheed-
ing. One or two, though, could not
keep their bright eyes from the
girl in green.
At last the bundle satisfied her
and she started down the bridge
rapidly. As she walked, the wind
from Plaza Goiti molded her
rounded limbs and too full breasts;
and she lowered her left arm where
it helped her right and pulled her
dress from her body.
Strong steps sounded behind her
and she quickened hers. From out
of the corner of her eye she saw a
man walking beside her; and when
he slowed his steps to suit hers, she
tried to walk faster. Her bosom
rose and fell and the wind played
freely with her skirt.
Anita! Anita!” the man said
softly. But she walked on as
though she had not heard. "Anita!
he continued to say, almost into her
ears, and then he grasped her left
arm confidently. “As if you don’t
know me!” he said, and looked at
her boldly with a laugh.
Anita turned her head with an
evasive smile, her eyes looking un¬
certainly at the man.
“Where did you come from?” he
asked.
She was silent
"Anita, where did you come
from?"
"From the school," she answered
at last, again slightly tossing her
head.
“School! What school? Ah! a
dressmaking school!” He began to
laugh, “You—you studying to be
a dressmaker!
They were at Plaza Goiti now and
Anita pulled her arm from the
man’s grasp. She crossed the Pla¬
za hurriedly, being narrowly miss¬
ed by several cars; and suddenly,
turned towards a Chinese grocery
store. The man, who was not far
behind. her, joined some men who
were chatting and laughing in front
of it. Later, laughter rose from
them while they looked at the gro¬
cery.
Inside the store, Anita went to
the innermost counter and began
looking at the candy for sale; and
through the five minutes she wait-
ed for the bus, she stayed there,


buying nothing and with her head
down. The laughter from outside
came to her, again she tossed her
head slightly while she fidgeted
with the bundle she carried.
The bus came. She went out of
the store slowly. Smirking men
surrounded her as she appeared,
pressing upon her from all sides,
breathing on her neck. As she took
her seat in the bus, she saw two
delicately pretty girls in white and
with books on their laps looking at
her with bright, impersonal eyes.
Men pushed and struggled for
the seat beside her and a dark
young man in a sweater got it. He
jostled her when he sat down and
proffered exaggerated apologies,
but she did not look at him and at
last he became quiet. All through
the trip he crowded her and all the
while snickers rose from behind.
At the corner of Vito Cruz and
Taft Avenue, she alighted. The
young man beside her found diffi¬
culty in putting his legs out of her
way, so that his knees brushed
against her thighs. All the pas¬
sengers on the bus, including the
driver, turned to watch her as she
walked rapidly and straight across
the street as though she did not see
the cars that whizzed by her.
She went through an alley bet¬
ween two frame apartments and
soon was in the midst of small ni¬
pa houses hidden behind. Here her
pace slackened and her countenance
lost its tenseness.
The ground was wet and uneven
and full of rubbish; and once, as she
jumped over a pool of dark slimy
water, her ankle gave way under
her and she tottered on her high-
heeled sandals.
Pale, pretty women, hair waved
and in loose wrappers, yawned on
the bamboo stairs. Some greeted
her.
“Hey, Anita! Back from
school?
“Yes. Have you just awakened?”
“Yes. You better hurry to catch
some sleep for tonight!”
Anita hurried on. On adobe stones
laid on the muddy ground, over
guy wires of houses, past damp and
unpleasant smelling batalans, she
hurried until she came to her own
home.
A small dog began to bark in
welcome when she unlatched the
gate and a woman’s face appeared
over the window sill.
“You’re late, Anita!
said the
woman irritably. “That’s bad for
you!"
“I had to do some additional les¬
sons, Mother," she answered, while
she lowered the bundle she carried


and stopped over the joyful dog.
She sat on a low stool and, with
the puppy in her lap, took off her
shoes. Then she sighed, closed her
eyes, and leaned her head against
the nipa wall. She felt the puppy
licking her face and, still with her
eyes closed, began to caress it. It
began to bark ecstatically.
“Hurry up and leave that dog!
"Try
came the cry from the sala.
to get some sleep for tonight!”
Anita rose slowly. She picked up
her bundle and walked across the
door that led to the sala. As she
passed the group sitting with cards
in their hands, a plump loose¬


mouthed woman looked at her and
said: “Anita is getting less pret¬
ty. Not like when she was still
dancing here in Pasay. Her skin
is bad now, Aling Marta.
Aling Marta grunted for answer
and laid her card on the low table
with a snap. She took betel nut
from a plat beside her and began to
chew furiously.
Inside the bedroom, Anita placed
her patterns carefully on a shelf
beside the bed. Then she lowered
the pink curtain and undressed. It
did not take her long to do so, but
before lying down, she looked at

APOLOGIA.—F. R. Omila of
Iloilo writes: “Trim the frequency
of your perpendicular pronoun, or
shall I say, put a little economy in
In other words.
your use of ‘I’s."
egoism is attributed to me—not for
the first time.
I suppose that is meant to be a
rap on the knuckles; but I am tak¬
ing it as a pat on the back. To
call a writer an egoist is to compli¬
ment him: it is to put him in the
company of Charles Lamb and
Francis Thompson, of Elizabeth
Barrett Bowning and Edna St. Vin¬
cent Millay, of St. Therese and St.
every
Augustine—in short, of
author hampered by neither dif-
fidence nor pretence.
And why? Because the writer
born and bred is told, first by in¬
stinct and later by experience, that
he—in the words of Alexander
Smith—"speaks better about him¬
self than about anything else. Cer¬
tainly there is no subject with
which he is better acquainted, and
on which he has a better title to be


heard.” That is why bookmen
ranging from Montaigne of the
sixteenth century—who said, “It is
myself I portray... myself am the
groundwork of my book"—to Wil¬
liam Saroyan of our own day—who
wrote, " I am a story-teller, and l
have but a single story, myself”
have not been too shy to broadcast:
“This is what I think, and what I
feel, and what I have done or not
done."
And why not? Egoism can be of¬
fensive, but often—in an author,
especially—it is the essence of in-
dividuality, the life-blood of per¬
sonality, the heart of charm, and
the touch of Nature which makes


the whole world kin. To assert
that even love is selfish is to make
no startlingly new statement: when
one says, "I love you,” the emphasis
is on I not you; the declaration, if
elaborated, would be, “I love you
because you please me—because
consider you beautiful, I believe
that your character is excellent, I
think you will suit me better than
Maria, Juana, or Petra.
I repeat, therefore, that to be
egotistical is no extraordinary cala¬
mity. Especially, I also repeat, in
the case of those who push the pen
or tickle the typewriter. “ ‘Be
yourself if you want to create any¬
thing original' is a truism," says


Ernest Dimnet. “How can you do
anything that will really be yours
if you are not conscious of your
own personality, if you are some¬
body else, or even everybody else,
or if you are not quite the man you
know you could be?... Balzac
poured himself out in conversation
in a way which gave offence to peo¬
ple of an over-refined taste, but
which delighted psychologists...
All people endowed with powerful
vitality or imagination, most peo¬
ple with a passion for independence
which life has not damped too sev-
erely, are not afraid of forcing
themselves to the forefront...
Marie Bashkirtseff, now that we
have some portions of her diary in
their entirety and not carefully
edited by Andre Theuriet, may be
a Queen of Flirts or a Queen of
Snobs; she certainly is the author
of one of the most sincere human
documents we possess. Is there a
more irritating book in English
literature than Evelina? Yet, Fran¬
ces d'Arblay’s self-complacency is
so marvellously transparent that
after a century and a half the book
has not been killed by its faults."
Indeed, as the editors of The
Master Classies have pointed out,
‘In a sense nearly all books are
autobiographical. Letters, travel,
scientific achievements, essays—
what else are these?” What else
are those, in very truth? Even no¬
velists—who are not as frankly
egotistical as, say, the essayists—
seem to be at their best when they
write autobiographies in the guise
of fiction. Dickens has given us
nothing better than “David Copper¬
field"; Maugham, than "Of Human
Bondage”; Remarque, than "All
Quiet on the Western Front”; Miss
Alcott, than "Little Women"; and
so on. And the poems which burn
with beauty and in beauty are those
which tell the poet’s, rather than
another’s, love story. Our best
subjects are ourselves.
This is particularly true of co¬
lumnists. “The columnist," says our
leading columnist, "is very personal.
His column, like the familiar essay,
is definitely an organ of personal¬
ity... His manner must necessarily
follow the personal nature of his
point of view. Nowhere is the
style so much the man. Now he is
intimate, now he is distant; now
matter-of-fact, now elaborate—as
he chooses to be and as his mood
dictates.”
True: who says columnist says
essayist. And who says essayist
says egoist, declared my G. K. on
an occasion when he also remarked:
“It does not matter that Mr. Shaw’s
sentences often begin with the pro¬
noun ‘I.' The Apostles’ Creed be¬
gins with the pronoun ‘T'; but it
goes on to rather more important
nouns and names."
That is our apology and our just-
ification. We begin at home, yes,
but we do not remain there. We
wander out, far afield and even to
beyond the stars. If we see only
with our eyes, it is because we
have no other eyes at our disposal.

This PIG WENT

o MALRA
BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW?
Condensed from a contributed article
By NICOLAS S. SEVILLA
(Asst, Veterinarian, Bureau of Animal Industry)


PrHERE are more pigs that go
to market than those that
Astay at home. And those
that go to market travel a long
way; some come to Manila from
as far away as Cagayan.
Manila Is Greatest Consumer
The residents of Manila consume
an average of from 400 to 500 hogs
a day. If these porkers were placed
end to end, they would occupy
around two-thirds of a kilometer.
Their combined weight would be
35,000 kilos! A total of 135,745
hogs arrived at Manila from the
provinces in 1934, and 148,903 in
1935.
Big hog dealers send out buyers
on commission basis to different
provinces, the most important of
which are Cagayan, Isabela, the Ilo¬
cos provinces, Pangasinan, Batan¬


Hogs, already dressed, being carried to
wagons for distribution in the city mar¬
kets.

gas, Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, and
Nueva Ecija. These compradores
receive a commission of from P0.50
to P1.00 per hog.
Almost invariably these compra¬
dores who poke about in far-flung
barrios for pigs carry around um¬
brellas with them. The umbrella
has almost become a trade-mark for
pig buyers, and so a young man
would rather risk getting drenched
in a rain than lug along an um¬
brella and be called a "pig buyer."
Raising pigs for either home con-
sumption or for sale has been an
old sideline among Filipinos. There
being no garbage system in the
provinces, the problem of disposing
of kitchen and table scraps is con¬
veniently solved by the presence of
a pig or several pigs.
Young pigs for this purpose are
bought at a nominal cost just after
they have been weaned; this is
usually from 3 to 4 months after
birth. The care and feeding of the
little pigs are almost negligible,
but as they grow older they be¬
come a drain on the pocketbook.
This is the time when owners are
very eager to sell their pigs.
Hogs Are Gathered
To these small hog raisers go the
compradores. In some cases the
owners take their pigs to the market
and the comprador meets them
there. The pigs bought are gath-
ered at shipping centers from
where they are shipped by truck to
Manila in batches of from 40 to 50
heads. The general rule is that the
farther a place is from Manila, the
cheaper are its hogs.
These hogs are taken to the Ve¬
lasquez corral at Tondo, which is
the principal hog center in Manila.
The trucks carrying them arrive
usually at midnight, sometimes at
dawn. Cavite towns and those
bordering the Laguna bay ship
their hogs either by boat or by
truck to Quinta market, where
they arrive in great numbers every
Saturday morning.
The principal provinces supplying
Manila with fresh pork, arranged
according to their importance, are
Batangas, Pangasinan, Isabela,
Nueva Ecija, Zambales, Cagayan,
Ilocos Sur, Nueva Vizcaya, Laguna,
Rizal, Tayabas, Cavite, Cebu, and
La Union. According to the 1934
annual report of the bureau of
animal industry, Batangas sent
45,365 hogs to Manila during
1934; Pangasinan, 26,970; Nueva


Ecija, 15,862; Isabela, 10,789.
Cebu, however, raises the great-
est number of hogs. In 1934 Cebu
raised 228,052 hogs. Pangasinan
was a close second with 153,467,
Leyte third with 121,083, Manila
fourth with 111,288, Bohol fifth
with 100,136, and Iloilo sixth with
97,659.
Generally the hogs arriving at
Manila from the provinces vary in
weight from 60 to 80 kilos each.
Batangas sends the greatest num-
ber of noticeably heavy pigs. The
unusual size of pigs in that prov-
ince is a result of the efforts of
the bureau of animal industry in
introducing better breeds of hogs,


such as the Berkshire.
Hogs Arrive In Manila
Before the pigs are unloaded in
the Velasquez corral at Tondo,
the livestock inspectors of the bu¬
reau of animal industry inspect
them one by one for any infectious
animal diseases.
If the owners themselves bring
the hogs to Manila, they usually
employ the services of a middle¬
man who sells the animals to Chin¬
ese dealers. The middlemen are
given a commission of thirty cent-
avos a head.

First   Editor Wins Honor

EDITOR
VYy ITH editors of all sorts
W springing up like the pro¬
verbial mushrooms all
around, the public has begun to
take these transient figures as a
matter of course. But Editor Ju¬
lio L. Liquigan of the "Abulug
Chronicle” merits something more
than a passing glance.
Of course you
have not heard of,
or seen in, the
newsstands, much
1 ess read, the
"Abulug Chroni¬
cle.” This is sim¬
ply because this
publication has on¬
ly six copies for
every issue and it
comes out only
once a month.
This limited number of copies is
not, however, this paper’s (and of
course its editor’s) claim to dis¬
tinction; it is the fact that it is not
printed or even mimeographed but
is laboriously typewritten (single¬
spaced) on ordinary typewriting
paper.
Editor Liquigan is also the pub¬
lisher, reporter, typist, proofreader,
and general handy man—all rolled
in one. For four years now the
editor has put out his unpretentious
paper, the first issue (July 30,
1932) being a six-paged affair cram¬
med with pleasant town gossip,
anecdotes concerning some of the
Abulug residents, and other trifles
that are really news to the people
in that almost unknown town of
far-flung Cagayan.
The editor-publisher-reporter-ty-
pist-proofreader-handy man uses a


good part of the day only in ham¬
mering out from his machine the
regular six copies. At times when
an issue reaches 15 pages, he uses
up almost double that time. His
father, who is a practical-minded
business man, frequently chided
him for wasting his time on so un¬
profitable an undertaking.
Indeed the work
is not only unpro¬
fitable but is a
decidedly losing
proposition. Edit¬
or Liquigan uses
SO
his own machine,
A
 paper, labor, and
E
time—and gives

E
" out the copies
free.
“I cannot help doing it,” he said,
"in much the same way as others
cannot help taking a walk or smok¬
ing. It’s a labor of love."
This 36-year-old editor studied
in the U.P., taking journalism sub¬
jects under the late Carl N. Taylor,
but continued and finished his law
studies in the Blackstone Institute
of Chicago. Shortly after he ar¬
rived in 1932, he started putting
out the "Abulug Chronicle."
There are on’y two regular "sub¬
scribers” to this publication: the
former parish priest of Abulug,
Rev. Fr. Salvador Baua, and Caga¬
yan’s Assemblyman Regino Veridia¬
no. The rest of the copies are cir¬
culated among the residents of
Abulug until almost every one of
the English-reading people in the
town has read them.

Vicente Alhano Pacis, first editor of
 : wins distinction.


T seems that if Vicente Albano
Pacis, former editor of
R
  and now editor of
The Philippines Herald, were to go
to America and look for a news¬
paper job, he would have a very
good chance of landing one, espe¬
cially in the state of Illinois in
which are found a number of great
American newspapers.
This statement is not one of those
vain suppositions starting with the
utilitarian word “if.” For the
authorities of the School of Jour¬
nalism of the University of Illinois
where Pacis did his undergraduate
work in Journalism have composed
a mythical newspaper staff manned
by 25 alumni and Pacis is one
of them. The staff is called by
Director Lawrence W. Murphy of
the Journalism School the "All¬
Time Illini Staff" and was pub¬
lished, among other places, in the
publications of the university and
in the Souvenir Directory of Sigma
Delta Chi of which Pacis is also a
member.
Pacis is in good company on the
mythical staff. His editor is
Charles Henry Dennis, who grad-
uated in 1881, and who is editor
emeritus of The Chicago Daily
News. With him on the editorial


lecting objects is
the pleasure of
possession, David
Y. Guerrero of
Barrio Lomboy,
municipality of La
Paz, Tarlac, col¬
lects newspapers
a n d magazines
that other people
might share with
D. Y. Guerrero
him the pleasure
of reading them.
Young David Y. Guerrero, who
is a provincial correspondent for
some Manila publications, is thus
the unofficial librarian for the bar¬
rio of Lomboy; his unpretentious
house, the unofficial library of the
barrio folk.


staff, the members of which are
listed alphabetically without special
designations, are such famous
American newspaper men as Mark
Van Doren, Columbia University
professor and one of the editors of
The Nation; Richard G. Massock,
Paris correspondent of the United
Press; Frank W. Scott, editor-in¬
chief of D. C. Heath Co., book pub¬
lishers of Boston; Joseph Allan
Nevins, famous editor, professor
and Pulitzer Prize-winning bio¬
grapher; William Lloyd White, lab¬-
or editor of The Cleveland Press;
Ben Kartman, make-up editor of
The Chicago Daily News; Joseph
R. Ator, star reporter of The
Chicago Tribune; Wallace R. Eduel,
former editorial writer and now
Berlin correspondent of The Chi¬
cago Daily News; Thomas W. Mor¬
row, assistant city editor of The
Chicago Tribune; and Irving Dil¬
liard, editorial writer on the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch.
Illinois alumni in newspaper
work naturally dominate the Illi¬
nois field, although some of them
have also risen high in New York,
Boston, and other newspaper cen¬
ters. Strangely enough, Pacis, be¬
fore returning to the Philippines in
1926, had held newspaper positions
in Wisconsin and Washington,
D. C., but never in Illinois, except
a two-year undergraduate report¬
orial job on The Daily Illini, news¬
paper of the university and reputed
to be the largest college newspaper
in the world.
After finishing his graduate
studies in the University of Wis¬
consin, Pacis became a copyreader
on The Milwaukee Journal. From
the Journal he moved to Washing¬
ton, D. C., where he obtained a
correspondent’s job in the Asso¬
ciated Press bureau there. In
point of fact, however, Pacis has
for years served newspaper readers
in Illinois and the District of Co¬
lumbia as Manila correspondent of
The Chicago Tribune and The
Washington Post.

Ray Johnston. "Imagine — one
voice reaching a million people."
Arrived a letter next morning...
looked innocent enough but when
opened, read as follows:—"Dear
Mr. Johnston: Lucky for you the
millions you spoke of can’t reach
you.
Therein lies the difficulty of
broadcasting. What does the ra¬

program director seratches his
head and looks properly worried.
He flashes on a snappy jazz pro¬
gram. Some folks cuss. A sym-

Harris, imaginative manager of
Radio Manila, has solved the prob¬

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
The death of Harold Monkhause, a Landon
invalid, has heen the subject of an inquest
at which is determined that the dead man
was willfully murdered through paisoning hy
some persan or persans unknown. A search
of the Mankhause residence fallowa. A bot-
tle which the police officers helieve had con¬
tained poison is found in the library which
is under the care of Wallingford, the dead
man’s secretary. Another such bottle
found in Madeline Norris’ room. Nothing i
found in Mra. Monkhouse's chamher or in
the servanta’ quarters.
Rupert Mayfield, friend of the Mankhouse
family, hires Dr. Thorndyke, famed medico¬
legal expert, to conduct an investigation in¬
dependent of that of the police. Dr. Thorn¬
dyke hesitates ta accept, saying that as in
vestigator he is under abligation to expase
all the facts which may prave the undaing
of ane or more persans intimately connect-
ed with the Mankhouse household: Mrs.
Monkhouse, Madeline Norris. Wallingford,
Mabel Withers (the hausemaid), the cook,
the kitchen maid. Dr. Dimsdale (family phy-
sician), and Mayfield. Mayfield insists that
Thorndyke investigate. He consents, and
asks Mayfield to give an account of haw ha
came to he connected with the Monkhause
household. Mayfield explains that an ald
friend of his father's, a Mr. Keene, had a
lovely daughter Stella, wha became May¬
field’s childhood playmate. Mr. Keene,
widower, later married Barhara’s mother, with
the result that Stella, Barhara, and Mayfield
grew together. All orphaned by the time
they had hecame adult, they continued an
very friendly terms until Stella died—presu¬
mahly of consumption inherited from her
mother hut rather suddenly, and at a time
when it was thought that she might pull
through. In his grief, Mayheld leaves for
Canada, and while there hears that Barbara
had married Monkhause. He returns and


hecomes a gond friend of the Mankhouses.
He agrees to give Thorndyke further detail
by placing at his dispasal a diary he. May¬
field, had kept from boyhood. An attempt i
made on Thorndyke’s life, and it turns out
that Wallingford and Madeline have been
buying suspicious drugs, although the latter
has explained her purchases plausibly.
Thorndyke decides to inspect the now dis¬
mantled Monkhouse home, and sets out with
Mayfield.


URING the comparatively
short journey I made a few
B
not very successful efforts
to discover what was Thorn-
dyke’s real purpose in making
this visit of inspection to the
dismantled house. But his re¬
ticence and mine were not quite si¬
milar. He answered all my ques¬
tions freely. He gave me a wealth
of instances illustrating the valua¬
ble evidence obtained by the ins¬
pection of empty houses. But none
of them seemed to throw any light
on his present proceedings. And
when I pointed this out, he smiling¬
ly replied that I was in precisely
the same position as himself.
“We are not looking for corro¬
borative evidence," said he. “That


belongs to a later stage of the in¬
quiry. We are looking for some
suggestive fact which may give us
a hint where to begin. Naturally
we cannot form any guess as to
what kind of fact that might be."
It was not a very illuminating
answer, but I had to accept it, al¬
though I had a strong suspicion
that Thorndyke’s purpose was not
quite as vague as he represented it
to be, and determined unobtrusive¬
ly to keep an eye on his proceed¬
ings.
“Can I give you any assistance?”
I enquired, craftily, when I had let
him into the hall and shut the outer
door.
“Yes,” he replied “there is one
thing that you can do for me which
will be very helpful. I have brought
a pocket of cards with me”—here
he produced from his pocket a pack¬
“If
et of stationer’s post-cards.
you will write on each of them the
description and particulars of one
room with the name of the occu¬
pant in the case of bedrooms, and
lay the card on the mantelpiece of
the room which it describes, I shall
be able to reconstitute the house as
it was when it was inhabited.
Then we can each go about our res¬
pective businesses without hinder¬
ing one another.”
I took the cards—and the fairly
broad hint—and together we made
a preliminary tour of the house,
which, now that the furniture, car¬
pets and pictures were gone, looked
very desolate and forlorn; and as
it had not been cleaned since the
removal, it had a depressingly dirty
and squalid appearance. Moreover;
in each room, a collection of rub¬
bish and discarded odds and ends
had been roughly swept up on the
hearth, converting each fireplace
into a sort of temporary dust-bin.
After a glance around the rooms
on the ground floor, I made my
way up to the room in which Har¬
old Monkhouse had died, which was
my principal concern as well as
Thorndyke’s
“Well, Mayfield,” the latter re¬
marked, running a disparaging eye


round the faded, discoloured walls
and the blackened ceiling, "you will
have to do something here. It is
a shocking spectacle. Would you
mind roughly sketching out the
position of the funiture? I see that
the bedstead stood by this wall with
the head, I presume, towards the
window, and the bedside table
about here, I suppose, at his right
hand. By the way, what was there
on that table? Did he keep a sup-
ply of food of any kind for use at
night?”
“I think they usually put a little
tin of sandwiches on the table when
the night preparations were made."
“You say 'they.' Who put the
box there?”
“I can’t say whose duty it was
in particular. I imagine Barbara
would see to it when she was at
home. In her absence it would be
done by Madeline or Mabel."
"Not Wallingford?”
"No. I don’t think Wallingford
ever troubled himself about any of
the domestic arrangements except¬
ing those that concerned Barbara.
“Do you know who made the
sandwiches?”
“I think Madeline did, as a rule.
I know she did sometimes."
"And as to drink? I suppose he
had a water-bottle, at any rate."
“Yes, that was always there, and
a little decanter of whiskey. But
he hardly ever touched that. Very
often a small flagon of lemonade
was put on the table with the sand¬
wiches."

It was Yasotaro Morri, retired
editor of the Osaka Mainichi, who
said in one of his speeches in Ma¬
nila that the struggle among na¬
tions in the Orient is between those
who have and those who have not.
This fact is not only true with na¬
tions but among classes of a na¬
tion. In the United States, for ex¬
ample, the present struggle bet¬
ween Republicans and Democrats
resolves itself into this. And those
who have, naturally, will not give
up without a struggle. Mr. Roose¬
velt in all probability will win
again, not as overwhelmingly, per¬
haps, as four years ago, but this
would not be because the American
upper class did not try to stop him.
The efforts the Republicans, the
party of the haves, will exert to
stop Roosevelt may be gleaned from
the following:
..a phenomenon which social
historians in the future will very
likely record with perplexity if not
with astonishment: the fanatical
hatred of the President which to¬
day obsesses thousands of men and
women among the American upper
class.
‘It permeates, in greater or less
degree, the whole upper stratum of
American society. It has become
with many persons an idee fixe.
‘That there is a widespread con¬
riction among the wealthy that
they are being butchered to make
a Roman holiday for the less for¬
tunate is undeniable. But it is cer¬
tain that as a class the wealthy
have suffered relatively less than
any other from the economic events
of the past three years...
“Certainly if there is an aristo¬
cracy in the United States, the
Roosevelts are of it. They have
owned landed estates in the neigh¬
borhood of Skaneateles and Pough¬
keepsie since early in the seven¬
teenth century. They have always
had sufficient money to enable
them to lead cultivated, pleasant
lives. And so there is no forgive¬
ness for their seeming disloyalty.
Mr. Roosevelt, say the members of
his class, has insinuated himself
into a position of supreme authori¬
ty and now proceeds to snipe at his
friends.
“To attempt to make a reason¬
able answer to point out a few
stray facts, even to inquire whether
the President of the United States
should govern on behalf of a class,


President Franklin D. Roosevelt: Fana¬
tical hatred for him obsesses theusands
of men and women among the American
upper class.
is soon seen to be futile in the face
of this unrelenting hostility. Facts,
unless they happen by chance to
serve the purpose, have very little
to do with the emotion in question."
We have a friend out there in Da¬
vao, A. S. G., who has long been
wanting to join us and we believe


he is in earnest too. He wants to
come, to be a Manila newspaper
man because, among other things
he can write in the city. But we
have been earnestly discouraging
him because we know that aside
from the meager pay journalism
doles out to ambitious journalists,
journalism and writing for poster¬
ity are not compatible. There are
exceptions, of course, but it is saf-
er to talk of the average than of
exceptions. What we may say to
A. S. G. and to hundreds of others
who think as he does will not mean
anything. Who are we to speak
pontifically on such a subject as
writing? But perhaps our friends
will listen better to Sinclair Lewis:
What the young writer of to¬
day should contemplate is a dual
profession—a n d incidentally it
would be the best thing in the
world for his tortured creative¬
ness to be forced to touch some
non-literary world, forced to re¬
member what saner folk are daily
up to. Let the young Balzac or
Byron not only wear his elbows
shiny at his desk, but let him with
equal assiduity learn another and
slightly more lucrative calling.

the whole book must be read. Shy-

individual’s failure to adjust him¬
self to his surroundings, and Dr.
Link thinks this can be cured. That
there is something to this is illus¬
trated in the life of Nathaniel

The famous Hawthorne was in¬

to avoid meeting and talking with
them. His wife, left to entertain

her natural shyness and developed
an amazing poise. The great

Design of ocean liners may be
revolutionized by a construction
method advanced by Capt. M. L.
Gilbert of Michigan, inventor of an

by rolling the metal into a tube and
breaking it in three places, thus
forming two curves in the bottom
and one on each side. This flut-
ing is said to increase strength and
rigidity and to cause the boat to
ride the surface as its speed in¬
creases. The design of the bottom
practically eliminates water-spank¬
ing, since the water is thrown four
ways into the air pocket. Welded
throughout, the new boat carries
air chambers under the seats. Capt.
Gilbert believes that ocean liners

miles an hour. A 700-foot ship
of this type, drawing twenty-eight
feet of water while at rest, would
draw only six or seven feet upon
reaching twenty miles per hour, ac¬
cording to the inventor. From
there on, owing to less water re¬
sistance, the ship would be able to
exceed sixty miles per hour with
the same horsepower.

Coach Uses Diving Helmet
To Observe Swimmers
Underwater observation of swim¬
mers has been adopted by Robert
J. Kiphuth, coach of the Yale teams
and of the American Olympic team,


and he wears a diving helmet on
the job. Coach Kiphuth says that
this is the best way to get a true
image of the swimmer, since refrac-
tion waves and bubbles tend to dis¬
tort the image when the swimmer
is viewed from above the surface.
The diving helmet makes it possible
to watch each swimmer. The div-
ing outfit consists of weighted vest,
helmet and ropes, the last for safety
purposes because Coach Kiphuth
cannot swim a stroke, in spite of
having developed champion swim¬
mers.

Collapsible Glider
An amphibian glider recently
tested at the Central Airdrome in
Russia is blown up like an auto¬
mobile tube, and can be collapsed
and packed away in a suit case.
Made of a special rubberized fabric,
the odd craft is inflated through
various valves with a hand pump in
about fifteen minutes. A tail-piece
of hard rubber, and other stiffen¬
ing parts, give the necessary rigid-
ity to keep the glider from collaps¬
ing under the stresses of flight. It
weighs less than ninety-three
pounds, is about twenty-six feet
long, and has a wing spread of just
over thirty-one feet. Controls are
operated by means of ropes and the
unique sailplane is said to be ex¬
ceptionally stable and easy to handle
while in flight.

— R. PEDRO G. GUIANG, the
present principal of the Tor¬
Dres High School of Manila,
was born in Pasuquin, Ilocos Sur,
on July 14, 1898.
He is the son of Simeon Guiang,
an ex-employee of the Spanish
government and one-time political
leader in the town of Pasuquin,
and Lucina Garaza.
Principal Guiang studied in the
public schools of his home town and
later went to Laoag for his high
school education. He finished his
secondary course in the Ilocos Nor¬
te provincial high school in 1916,
with high scholastic record.
The whole Ilocos region, at that
time, was in the grip of a strange
fever which, for some years, was
looked upon with horror by civic
leaders in that section of the coun¬
try. It was the immigration fever
which was sending able-bodied Ilo¬
canos to the territory of Hawaii
and the United States. Young
Guiang, like many young men of
his town, heard the tall stories of
overflowing riches in American
farms and cities and wondered
if he, also, could reach that mythi¬
cal stream of money which his own
townsfolk mentioned in their
lengthy letters. In fact, he heard
that Pasuquin boys abroad were
sending home money by the thou¬
sands in a most every trans-Pacific
boat which arrived in Manila.
At night, the boys of Pasuquin
would gather together and read
aloud letters received from their
kinsmen working abroad.
The
letters spoke of "big money" and
of the "women who are very free
and easy with their love."
Stories like those were enough to
make the heart of any country
young man yearn for America. And
it was no wonder that, although
Guiang was already admitted to
teach in the elementary school of
Pasuquin, he should still dream of
America. He taught for one year
and was principal of the Burgos
Elementary School for three years,
but he was not satisfied with his
job. He looked upon his job as a¬
means to an end, for he saved his
earnings. In 1920, after saving a
little amount to pay for his pas¬
sage and for all things necessary
during the trip, he bade his pa¬
rents good-bye and left for the
United States. Like many Ilocano
young men, he succumbed to the
travel fever.
He left Manila in April, 1920,
and landed in Seattle. He enrolled
in the University of Washington
and did odd jobs to support himself
in his studies. His parents sent
him a small allowance every month
but the money was barely enough
to pay for the things he needed in
college. During summer, he joined
Filipinos contracted for the Alas¬


kan canneries. He paid his tuition
fees with the money he earned in
Alaska.
Guiang was graduated with an
A.B. degree at the University of
Washington in 1926. Continuing
for another year, he was granted
his M.A. degree after one year of
college work. Other Filipinos
would have been satisfied with
those degrees and would have rush-
ed home in order to apply for jobs,
but Guiang didn’t. In spite of the
hardships he had to encounter in
supporting himself through school,
Guiang stayed for two more years
in the University of Washington,
majoring in school administration.
In 1929, he completed all his re¬
quirements for a doctor’s degree.
He returned in the summer of
that year and landed a job as class¬
room teacher in the Philippine
Normal School. After one year as
classroom teacher, he received his
appointment as supervisor in the


academic division of the bureau of
education. As such, he travelled
throughout the Islands, visiting va¬
rious primary and intermediate
schools. His work brought him to
almost all corners of the Archipela¬
go where schools are established,
and learned, at first hand, the ma¬
ny problems confronting public
school education in the Philippines.
In 1935, he was granted his
Ph. D. degree and had to go to the
United States to receive the honors.
So far, Dr. Pedro G. Guiang is the
first and only Filipino to be grant¬
ed a doctorate by the University of
Washington.
Dr. Guiang, because of his wide
knowledge of conditions obtaining
in the different places of the Is¬
lands, and because of the extensive
studies he had conducted on the
subject of public school finance,
worked side by side with Dr. Ga¬
briel Manalac, now under-secretary
of public instruction, in the Quezon


educational committee. His (and
Dr. Manalac’s) report on Financing
Public Education in the Philippines
is being made the basis for solving
the yearly school crisis here.
The principal of the Torres High
School married the former Miss
Herminia Morales of Laoag in 1932
and has one son: Pedro, Jr., 3.
Residence: 498 Recolletos.


Bride
The daughter of a real estate
owner did not become a May bride
because the Vice President of the
Commonwealth has been too busy
to act as sponsor.
To be definite, the wedding of
the young girl to an instructor in
a Manila high school, was an¬
nounced last May and Vice Presid¬
ent Osmena was talked into acting
as padrino at the wedding.
Don Sergio consented, but the
Vice Pesident is a busy man and
every Sunday found him occupied.
Week after week, the weddin g was
postponed. Recently, invitations
were issued by the parents of the
young couple. At last, the Vice
President was free.

Walk
The whole town was talking
about the kind of dancing General
Santos, chief of staff of the Phil¬
ippine Army, displayed in Zam¬
boanga and other towns of Minda¬
nao.
Confronted with that piece of
gossip, General Santos remarked
to friends, "While I don't dance, I
walk. That's more dignified."
Invitation
We did not know Muntinglupa is
a nice place until General Santos
started ballyhooing it.
First, he advertised it as the best
prison site available throughout the
Philippines.
Now, the same General is pass¬
ing around the word that it is an
ideal place for honeymooning
couples. “Come up and see me
sometime there,” he told G. Rivera
Liuag, Tribune’s latest matrimon¬
ial convert. “That’s an ideal place
for honeymooning couples."
Liuag regrets he had gone up to
Baguio instead.

Pelmde PO A
Successtul Day
A Nourishing Breakfast


adore breakfasts!” a dear
(O
old lady said to me once.
I That is because in her
home breakfasts are not the hur¬
ried coffee-gulping, roll-swallow¬
ing, newspaper-scanning variety
so common in many households.
The breakfast table is set in a
place where it gets the most light
and cheer. The cups and plates are
gay, almost expectant. The coffee
is fragrant and inviting. The eggs
have a tender film over the yolks.
And the butter melts on the toast.
No newspapers are allowed. The
members of the family talk pleas¬
antly of things they expect to do
that day.
A successful breakfast is very
largely a matter of the homema¬
ker’s disposition. Often because
this meal comes at the crack of
dawn when everyone is in a hurry
to get to school or the office it is
not treated as seriously as lunch or
supper. But a distinct effort should
be taken to make this matutinal
meal more of an occasion than an
incident.
There are those who like their
breakfast light and those who like
them heavy. The choice depends on
the occupation of the persons con¬
cerned. Personally I like them
both. I eat light on weekdays so as


not to sleep on my job and heavily
on Sundays because then, I can go
to bed afterwards if I want to.
But the average household needs
not so much the hearty breakfast
as the nourishing one. So the home¬
maker’s problem is to get light,
nourishing foods into her family.
First comes fruit—papaya, pine¬
apple, oranges—these are gaod
breakfast appetizers. The home-
maker will find that after the hub-
by and the children have eaten
their fruit they are ready for other
things. Eggs are a breakfast
standby and I see no reason why
not. They are one of the most nou¬
rishing foods and there are so ma¬
ny ways to prepare them. Eggs
fried or scrambled have nothing
wrong about them except that they
come in too often. Try poaching
them once in a while or breaking
them into the chocolate.
Milk is another important item
in the diet that, like eggs, should
and can be smuggled if necessary
into recalcitrant stomachs. Here
are some breakfast recipes to build
menus around.
FRENCH TOAST—Beat two
slightly, add half a teaspoon salt,
two tablespoons sugar and one
and a half cups milk. Soak eight
or so slices of stale bread in the


A gay tablecloth and bright china sets the tune for a cheerful breahfast.


mixture until quite soft. Cook on
a hot, we’l greased griddle; brown
on one side, turn and brown on
other side.
RICE IN MILK—Put three cups
milk, one teaspoon salt in a double
boiler. When hot, stir in half a cup
of washed rice and cook for an
hour or more, stirring often to pre¬
vent milk from curdling. Serve
with more milk.
BIBINGKA—This is a dish that
can be prepared one afternoon
and served at breakfast the next
morning. Dissolve a cup of con¬
densed milk in one and a half


cups hot water. Add three-fourths
cup sugar, and put in the grated
meat of one coconut, one beaten
egg, and a few anise seeds. Sift
three-fourths cup flour and add
to the mixture. Beat until no
lumps are left. Grease a piece of
banana leaf. Line a baking dish
(a round earthen baking dish will
do) with greased banana leaf.
Bake the mixture in this dish be¬
tween hot coals until cooked. To
determine if baked sufficiently,
stick a knife in center of bibing¬
ka. If the knife comes out clean,
it is cooked.

YrvHE smell of a clean healthy
skin is sweet and wholesome
A and “hair that is shining and
free” is naturally fragrant. Yet I
have sat behind pretty girls in
autobuses faintly smelling of yes¬
terday’s perspiration and held my
breath in crowds against the in-
tolerable rancid smell of unwash¬
ed hair.
It was Rupert Brooke, I believe,
who talked of hair’s fragrance and
the smell of a woman’s skin. He
was a poet, but even ordinary mor¬
tals talk fondly or otherwise of re¬
membered smells. Not even music
perhaps, can call forth a greater
host of associations than a haunt-
ing, elusive fragrance.
Most women pay attention to vi¬
sual appeal. They dress as pretti¬
ly as they know how, use powder
and lipstick wisely or unwisely and
otherwise make themselves attrac-
tive to the eye. But often they talk
in high, shrill voices, or in drab,
monotonous whines. And so very
few, alas, keep sweet.

The lady then who would be tru¬
ly lovely, must look lovely, sound
lovely—and smell sweet. She does
not acquire fragrance simply by
dousing herself with perfume be¬
cause the reek of the perfumery
shop is often more offensive than
pure unalloyed "b.o."
Instead she takes a bath daily,
washes her hair as often as neces¬
sary, cares for her teeth and nails.
If she is so fortunate as to have a
bath tub she probably uses bath
salts in the water to soften and to
scent it and make bathing a keen¬
er pleasure than it is already. She
buys herself mild soaps and consi¬
ders a generous supply of thick,
large towels an investment.
Then she gives herself a new deal
in fresh underthings every morn-
ing. She knows that the daily baths
count for nothing if she carries
with her the same dirt and perspi¬
ration that her pores have thrown
out the day before. Very likely she
keeps perfumed sachets between the
folds of her dresses in her apara¬
dor so that a faint all-over fra¬
grance envelops her when she slips
on a dress.
She chooses her powder not only
for its texture and the shade that
goes best with her color, but for
the pleasant unobtrusiveness of its


scent. If she uses perfume at all
she does so sparingly and with the
strategy of art, always keeping in
mind the golden rule in cosmetics,
“Better too little than too much."
Where a shorter-visioned sister
would merely tilt the perfume bot-
tle into her handkerchief, our cle¬
ver friend uses more imagination.
With an atomizer she sprays a lit-
tle perfume on her handkerchief, a
little into her bag, or a bit more
generously, on the hem of her skirt.
The fumes rise so that as she moves
about she literally walks in fra¬
grance. Like lighting, scent is
more effective when indirect.
If she were going to a dance she
would spray a little perfume be¬
hind her ears or in the hollow of
her throat, or on the bunch of
tiny artificial violets on her shoul¬
der. Always she is careful to dis¬
tribute fragrance on her person
with economy and taste.
Being perfume-wise she does not,
of course, use heavy exotic scents
for mornings. Uusually she is con¬
tent with the mild scent of a lotion
or an eau de cologne that she had
rubbed her skin with after her
bath. But if she does use scent in
the daytime she chooses, simple,
tangy ones, and uses them as un¬
obtrusively as possible.


Fragrant as a flower she comes
out of her home to school, or office
or to shop and wherever she goes
leaves pleasant impressions.

White Slaves Identified
A Visayan fortnightly has train¬
ed its guns on white slave traffic¬
kers in the south by boldly disclos¬
ing the identities of women of loose
virtues. The reading public took
on the game interestedly, but many
girls experienced mortification
when they saw their names and the
story of their secret lives splashed
across the newspaper pages.
The surprising thing about these
revelations is that most girls who
had seemed so sweet and pure and
innocent were the very ones steep-
ed in the murk of prostitution.
The press here, to remedy the
evils of illicit prostitution, advocat¬
ed a legalized red-light district.
But this move was blocked by an
army of moralists and reformers.
Meanwhile, despite disclosures, the
business of prostitution continues
to thrive.

Police Nationalization
I favor nationalizing police forc¬
es to make them modern and also
to keep the policemen away from
the grip of politics. A unified sys¬
tem, as recommended by the Prov-
incial Governors’ Committee to In¬
terior Secretary Quirino, would
make our police forces efficient,
free from outside interference,
with the members all physically
fit, intelligent, and honest in up-
holding the law.
There should be a raised stand-
ard of salary for policemen, and a
pension fund established for them.
Also, to maintain discipline, the
chief of police should have the po¬
wer to appoint and recommend re¬
moval for cause of town cops. The
present system does not even con¬
cede the police chief to reprimand
his subordinates. He is merely a
figurehead.

G. K. Chesterton, as The Forum remarked once, is one of the few of
whom it can be said most truthfully that they need no introduction. That
should be true even here, now that almost all of the country’s leading
columnists have written him up excellently apropos of his recent death...
Most of G. K.’s best poems are too long to be reproduced in this column,
but we trust that the ones reprinted below are fairly representative.
The Great Minimum
IT is something to have wept as we have wept,
It is something to have done as we have done,
It is something to have watched when all men slept,
And seen the stars which never see the sun.
It is something to have smelt the mystic rose,
Although it break and leave the thorny rods,
It is something to have hungered once as those
Most hunger who have ate the bread of gods.
To have seen you and your unforgotten face,
Brave as a blast of trumpets for the fray,
Pure as white lilies in a watery space,
It were something, though you went from me to-day.
To have known the things that from the weak are furled,
Perilous ancient passions, strange and high;
It is something to be wiser than the world,
It is something to be older than the sky.
In a time of sceptic moths and cynic rusts,
And fatted lives that of their sweetness tire,
In a world of flying loves and fading lusts,
It is something to be sure of a desire.
Lo, blessed are our ears for they have heard;
Yea, blessed are our eyes for they have seen:
Let thunder break on man and beast and bird
And the lightning. It is something to have been.
The Judgment Of England
"
I LL fares the land, to hastening ills a prey
Where Wealth accumulates and Men decay."
So rang of old the noble voice in vain
O’er the Last Peasants wandering on the plain,
Doom has reversed the riddle and the rhyme,
While sinks the commerce reared upon that crime,
The thriftless towns litter with lives undone,
To whom our madness left no joy but one;
And irony that glares like Judgment Day
Sees Men accumulate and Wealth decay.

As You Desire
Desire has elevated man’s ambi¬
tion to the highest pedestal of
struggle. It has brought constant
changes in the world where we
live, because with Desire goes the
triumph of civilization and culture.
Desire has made man industrious
and ambitious, made him create
new comforts and luxuries to satis¬
fy our whims, our fancies. Without
Desire there will be no progress,
neither will there be changes in
the life of man.
Desire has also ruined many a
man’s life, because for these men
Desire proved too strong to over¬
come.

Salts, fizzy drinks, palatable laxatives and
harsh purgatives are makeshifts. A mere
bowel movement doesn’t get at the cause. It

Profitable Business
A total of around P3.50 is spent
for each hog (excluding actual
cost), from the time it is bought
in the provinces to the time it is
sold in the market. This includes
truck fares, commissions, fees, etc
Thus a 60-kilo hog (dressed
weight), bought for ₱10 from the
provinces incurs a total expense of
P3.50, making the total cost P13.50.
If the pork is sold to the public
at P0.30 a kilo, a 60-kilo hog will
bring in ₱18. This means a pro¬
fit of P4.50 is made for every hog.
Not a bad business, eh?

“You seem to have made up your
mind pretty definitely, on the nega-
tive side, at least,” he remarked;
and then, looking round once more
at the walls with their faded
loosened paper, he continued: “I
take it that Mr. Monkhouse was
not a fresh-air enthusiast."
“He was not,” I replied. “He
didn’t much care for open windows,
especially at night. But how did
you arrive at that fact?
“I was looking at the wall-paper.
This is not a damp house, but yet
the paper on the walls on this room
is loosening and peeling off in all
directions. And if you notice the
distribution of this tendency you
get the impression that the mois¬
ture which lcosened the paper pro¬
ceeded from the neighbourhood of
the bed. The wall which is most
affected is the one against which
the bed stood; and the part of that
wall that has suffered most is that
which was nearest to the occupant
of the bed, and especially to his
head. That large piece, hanging
down, is just where the main
stream of his breath would have
impinged."
“Yes, I see the connection now
you mention it; and yet I am sur¬
prised that his breath alone should
have made the air of the room so
damp. All through the winter
season, when the window would be
shut most closely, the gas was burn¬
ing; and at night, when the gas was
out, he commonly had his candle¬
lamp alight. I should have thought
that the gas and the candle to¬
gether would have kept the air
fairly dry.
“That,” said Thorndyke, "is a
common delusion. As a matter of
fact they would have quite the op-
posite effect. You have only to
hold an inverted tumbler over a
burning candle to realize, from the
moisture which immediately con¬
denses on the inside of the tumbler,
that the candle, as it burns, gives
off quite a considerable volume of
steam. But of course, the bulk of
the moisture which has caused the
paper to peel in this room came
from the man’s own breath. How-
ever, we didn’t come here for de¬
bating purposes. Let us complete
our preliminary tour, and when we
have seen the whole house we can


each make such more detailed in¬
spection as seems necessary for our
particular purposes."
We accordingly resumed our
perambulation (but I noticed that
Thorndyke deposited his attache
case in Monkhouse’s room with the
evident intention of returning
thither), both of us looking about
narrowly: Thorndyke, no doubt, in
search of the mysterious “traces"
of which he had spoken, and I with
an inquisitive endeavour to ascer¬
tain what kind of objects or appear¬
ances he regarded as “traces."
We had not gone very far before
we encountered an object that even
I was able to recognize as signific¬
ant. It was in a corner of the long
corridor that we came upon a little
heap of rubbish that had been
swept up out of the way; and at
the very moment when Thorndyke
stopped short with his eyes fixed on
it, I saw the object—a little wisp
of knitting-wool of the well-remem¬
bered green colour. Thorndyke
picked it up, and, having exhibited
it to me, produced from his letten¬
case a little envelope such as seeds¬
men use, in which he put the trea¬
sure trove, and as he uncapped his


fountain pen, he looked up and
down the corridor.
“Which. is the nearest room to
this spot?” he asked.
“Madeline’s,” I replied. “That
is the door of her bedroom, on the
right. But all the principal bed-
rooms are on this floor and Bar¬
bara’s boudoir as well. This heap
of rubbish is probably the sweep¬
ings from all the rooms."
“That is what it looks like,” he
agreed as he wrote the particulars
on the envelope and slipped the lat¬
ter in his letter-case. “You notice
that there are some other trifles
in this heap—some broken glass,
for instance. But I will go through
it when we have finished our tour,
though I may as well take this
now."
As he spoke, he stooped and
picked up a short piece of rather
irregularly shaped glass rod with a
swollen, rounded end.
“What is it?” I asked.
“It is a portion of a small glass
pestle and it belongs to one of those
little glass mortars such as chem¬
ists use in rubbing up powders into
solutions or suspensions. You had

QUESTIONS:—(1) What is the
penalty imposed by law for tres¬
pass of premises? (2) A and B in¬
terchanged two camote fields, mak¬
ing a personal receipt for the trans¬
action. C comes along, claims a
part of what B has given to A in
consideration of the land exchange.
Can A sue C for trespass of pre¬
mises, or should he go to B and have
B sue C?—Rafael A. Omengan,
Sagada, Mt. Province.
ANSWERS:—(1) The penalty
of arresto menor (from one day to
thirty days) or a fine not exceed¬
ing P200.00, or both, shall be im¬
posed upon any person who shall
enter the closed premises or the
fenced estate of another, while
either of them are uninhabited,
if the prohibition to enter be
manifest and the trespasser has
not secured the permission of
the owner or the caretaker
thereof. (2) No act of trespass
has been committed, but a case
of forcible entry and detainer
may lie. If it is a case of forcible
entry, B, not A, should sue C. This
is so because the exchange is not
legally binding. For the transfer
to be valid and binding, the ex¬
change should have been executed
in a public document, signed by
all parties concerned, and duly
registered with the register of
deeds, and the same annotated in
the backs of the respective Tor¬
rens titles of the parcels of land,
if they are so titled.—Answered

better not touch it, though it has
probably been hand'ed pretty free¬

of discovering what it was last used
for."
He put it away carefully in an¬
other seed-envelope and then looked
down thoughtfully at the miniature
dust-heap; but he made no further
investigations at the moment and
we resumed the perambulation, I
placing the identification card on
the mantelpiece of each room while
he looked sharply about him, open¬
ing all cupboards and receptacles
and peering into their, usually
empty, interiors.

ants’ bedrooms and the attics-
leaving the indispensable cards—we


duction?—Manuel A. Sonico, Sara,
Iloilo.
ANSWERS:—When first fed,
give only a little at the start.
Give where they can reach at will
coarse sand and shell, the size of
binlid, and clean, cool, fresh water,
always. When the chicks are ten
days old or older, feed them with
finely-chopped grass, feeding a lit¬
tle at first and gradually increas¬
ing the amount. When the chicks
are about 3 months old, they can
be fed with coarser mash feed.
Copra meal may replace the binlid.
The grass and shell should also be
cbarser.
The feed mixture used by the
bureau of animal industry that
has given good results is as fol¬
lows: 4 parts—darak (tiquitiqui),
2 parts—fine ground yellow corn,
1 part—fine binlid, 1 part—fine
ground mongo, and 1 part—fish
meal or shrimp meal.
Of course, the palay and corn,
and remnants from the table and
kitchen are good feed, but you
cannot expect your hens to lay
well on such feed, or even expect
them to live long, if confined, es¬
pecially when feeding is not reg¬
ular and sufficient. Hens lay
well when allowed to range in a
wide field where they can find
plenty of bugs, tipaklong, and
others. It is therefore necessary
to give them what they need and
the cheaper these are the better.

dan" bananas, papaya and rimas,

went down to the basement and vis¬

servants’ parlour and the cel'ars;
and this brought our tour to an
end.
"we
"Now” said Thorndyke,
proceed from the general to the
particular While you are draw¬
ing up your schedule of dilapida¬
tions I will just browse about and
see if I can pick up any stray
crumbs in which inference can
find nourishment. It isn’t a very
hopeful quest, but you observe that
we have already lighted on two
objects which may have a meaning
for us.
“Yes, we have ascertained that
some one in this house used a par¬
ticular kind of wool and that some
one possessed a glass mortar.
Those do not seem to me very


weighty facts.
“They are not, he agreed; "in¬
deed, they are hardly facts at all.
The actual fact is that we have
found the things here. But tri¬
fles light as air sometimes serve to
fill up the spaces in a train of cir¬
cumstantial evidence. I think I
will go and have another look at
that rubbish-heap.
I was strongly tempted to follow
him, but could hardly do so in face
of his plainly expressed wish to
make his inspection alone. More¬
over, I had already seen that there
was more to be done than I had sup-
posed. The house was certainly
not in bad repair, but neither did
it look very fresh nor attractive.
Furniture and especially pictures
have a way of marking indelibly
the walls of a room, and the paint-
work in several places showed dis¬
figuring traces of wear. But I was
anxious to let this house, even at
a nominal rent, so that, by a few
years’ normal occupation its sin¬
ister reputation might be forgotten
and its va’ue restored.
As a result, I was committed to
a detailed inspection of the whole
house and the making of volumin¬
ous notes on the repairs and re¬
decorations which would be neces¬
sary to tempt even an impecunious
tenant to forget that this was a
house in which a murder had been
committed. For that was the cur¬
rent view erroneous as I believed
it to be. Note-book in hand, I pro¬
ceeded systematically from room to
room and from floor to floor, and
became so engrossed with my own
business that I almost forgot
Thorndyke: though I could hear
him moving about the house, and
once I met him—on the first floor,
with a couple of empty medicine
bott'es and a small glass jar in his
hands, apparently making his way
to Harold’s room, where, as I have
said, he had left his attache case.
That room I left to the last, as
it was already entered in my list
and I did not wish to appear to
spy upon Thorndyke’s proceedings.
When, at length, I entered the
room I found that he, like myself,
had come to the end of his task. On
the floor his attache case lay open,
crammed with various objects, sev¬
eral of which appeared to be bot¬
tles, wrapped in oddments of waste
paper (including some pieces of
wa’l paper which he had apparently
stripped off ad hoc when the other
supplies failed) and among which I
observed a crumpled fly-paper
“I
Respecting this I remarked:
don’t see why you are burdening
yourself with this. A fly-paper
is in no sense an incriminating
object, even though such things
have, at times, been put to unlaw¬
ful use.
“Very true, he replied as he
peeled off the rubber gloves which
he had been wearing during the
search. "A fly-paper is a perfectly
normal domestic object. But as
you say, it can on occasion be used
as a source of arsenic for criminal
purposes; and a paper that has
been so used will be found to have


had practically the whole of the
arsenic soaked out of it. As I hap¬
pened to find this in the servants"
parlour, it seemed worth while to
take it to see whether its charge of
arsenic had or had not been ex¬
tracted.
“But, I objected, "why on
earth should the poisoner—if there
really is such a person—have been
at the trouble of soaking out fly¬
papers when, apparently he was
able to command an unlimited
supply of Fowier’s Solution?”
Quite a pertinent question, May¬
field,” he rejoined. "But may
ask my learned friend whether he
found the evidence relating to the
Fowler’s Solution perfectiy satis¬
factory?'
But surely!” I exclaimed. "You
had the evidence of two expert wit¬
nesses on the point. What more
would you require? What is the
difficulty?”
“The difficulty is this. There
were several witness who testified
that when they saw the bottle of
medicine, the Fowler’s Solution had
not yet been added; but there was
none who saw the bottle after the
addition had been made!
“But it must have been added
before Mabel gave the patient the
last dose.
“That is the reference. But
Mabel said nothing to that effect.
She was not asked what colour the
medicine was when she gave the
patient that dose.
But what of the analysts and
the post mortem?
'As to the post mortem, the arse¬
nic which was found in the stom-
ach was not recognized as being in
the form of Fowler’s Solution; and
as to the analysts, they made their
examination three days after the
man died."
"Still, the medicine that they
analysed was the medicine that de¬
ceased had taken. You don’t deny
that, do you?”
“I neither deny it nor affirm it.
I merely say that no, evidence was
given that proved the presence of
Fowler’s Solution in that bottle be¬
fore the man died; and that the
bottle which was handed to the ana-
lysts was one that had been ex¬
posed for three days in a room
which had been visited by a num-
ber of persons, including Mrs.
Monkhouse, Wallingford, Miss Nor¬
ris, Mabel Withers, Amos Monk-
house, Dr. Dimsdale and yourself."
“You mean to suggest that the
bottle might have been tampered
with or changed for another? But,
my dear Thorndyke, why in the
name of God should any one want
to change the bottle?”
"I am not suggesting that the
bottle actually was changed. I am
merely pointing out that the evid-
ence of the analysts is material only
subject to the conditions that the
bottle which they examined was the
bottle from which the last dose of
medicine was given and that its
contents were the same as on that
occasion; and that no conclusive
proof exists that it was the same
bottle or that the contents were un¬

QUESTIONS:—What is t h e
cause of ringworm? How can it be
prevented? What is the cure for
it?—A   reader, Duman¬
jug, Cebu.
ANSWERS:—Ringworms spread
by contact and by the use in com¬
mon of hats, brushes, combs,
towels, and razors. The essential
point in the treatment of the va¬
rieties of ringworm affecting the
hairy portions of the body is to ap¬
ply to the roots of the hair one of
the various parasiticides, but be¬
fore this can be done the hair must
be removed. This is done by shav¬
ing the affected areas and pulling
out the loosened and diseased
stumps with a forceps. Crusts and
scales must be loosened with hot
water or oily applications. Among
the parasiticides which act most
effectively are sulphur ointment,
mercurial ointments, and iodine,
carbolic acid, and caustic potash
alone or in various combinations.
Ringworm of the scalp is very
successfully treated by exposure to
the X-ray.—The New Interna¬
tional Encyclopaedia."
QUESTIONS:—At the time my
little child got sick I consulted
a doctor who pronounced that the
disease is rickets. Poverty pre¬
vents us from using drugs. Even
if we could afford to buy it, we do
not believe in it. What shall we
do to make him well?—An Inquir¬
rer, Manila.
ANSWERS:—Rickets is a nu¬
tritional disease due to deficien¬


cies in diet and lack of vitamin
D. It is distinctly a disease of
early childhood beginning usually
during the early part of the se¬
cond year. Vitamin D is contain¬
ed normally in sunlight and con¬
sequently children who are ex¬
posed to the rays of the sun dur-
ing the summer months seldom
contract the disease. An infant
may be predisposed to rickets due
to diet deficiencies in the mother
previous to its birth. Too much
starchy food given infants may
cause the development of rickets.
There are other important fac-
tors such as bad ventilation,
dampness and deficiency in cal¬
cium, phosphorus, and fat. Breast-
fed babies are not as susceptible
to rickets as bottle-fed babies and
if breast milk be given to a child
suffering from rickets it ofen aids
in the recovery.
The treatment of rickets con¬
sists in a change of diet and a
change of environment if the
latter is poor. The diet should
contain sufficient fat, calcium,
phosphorus, and vitamins. Affect-
ed children should get sun baths
daily, should take cod-liver oil or
viosterol to supply vitamin D.
Orange juice and tomato juice are
of value in many cases. Daily
bathing and body massage are to
be recommended and plenty of
fresh air both day and night as
well as clean and hygienic sur¬
roundings are all of the greatest
value.—From “The Physical Cul¬
ture.”

changed."
“But what reason could there
be for supposing that it might have
been changed?'
“There is no need to advance any
reason. The burden of proof lies
on those who affirm that it was
the same bottle with the same con¬
tents. It is for them to prove that
no change was possible. But ob¬
viously a change was possible."
“But still,” I persisted, “there
seems to be no point in this sug¬
gestion. Who could have had any
motive for making a change? And
what could the motive have been?
It looks to me like mere logic-chop-
ping and hair-splitting."
"You wouldn’t say that if you
were for the defence,” chuckled
Thorndyke. “You would not let a
point of first-rate importance pass
on a mere assumption, no matter
how probable. And as to a possible
motive, surely a most obvious one
is staring us in the face. Suppos¬
ing some person in this household
had been administering arsenic in
the food. If it could be arranged
that a poisonous dose could be dis¬
covered in the medicine, you must
see that the issue would be at once


transferred from the food to the
medicine, and from those who con¬
trolled the food to those who con¬
trolled the medicine. Which is, in
fact, what happened. As soon as
the jury heard about the medicine,
their interest in the food became
extinct."
I listened to this exposition with
a slightly sceptical smile. It was
all very ingenious but I found it
utterly unconvincing.
“You ought to be pleading in
court, Thorndyke,” I said, "instead
of grubbing about in empty houses
and raking over rubbish-heaps. By
the way, have you found anything
that seems likely to yield any sug¬
gestions?”
'It is a little difficult to say,”
he replied. “I have taken posses¬
sion of a number of bottles and
small jars for examination as to
their contents, but I have no great
expectation in respect of them. I
also found some fragments of the
glass mortar—an eight-ounce mor-
tar it appears to have been."
“Where did you find those?” I
asked.
"In Miss Norris’s bedroom, in a
little pile of rubbish under the


grate. They are only tiny frag¬
ments, but the curvature enables
one to reconstruct the vessel pretty
accurately."
It seemed to me a rather futile
proceeding, but I made no comment.
Nor did I give utterance to a sus¬
picion which had just flashed into
my mind, that it was the discovery
of these ridiculous fragments of
glass that had set my learned friend
splitting straws on the subject of
the medicine bottle. I had not much
liked his suggestion as to the pos¬
sible motive of that hypothetical
substitution, and I liked it less now
that he had discovered the remains
of the mortar in Madeline’s room.
There was no doubt that Thorn¬
dyke had a remarkable constructive
imagination; and, as I followed
him down the stairs and out into
the square, I found myself faintly
uneasy lest that lively imagination
should carry him into deeper wa¬
ters than I was prepared to navi¬
gate in his company.

the vicinity of South Kensing-
ton Station, to which he had made
a bee line on leaving the square. As
he had made no suggestion that I
should go back with him, I infer-
red that he had planned a busy eve¬
ning examining and testing the
odds and ends that he had picked
up in the empty house; while I had
suddenly conceived the idea that I
might as well take the opportuni¬
ty of calling Madeline, who might
feel neglected if I failed to put in
an appearance within a reasonable
time after my return to town. Our
researches had taken up most of
the afternoon and it was getting on
for the hour at which Madeline
usually left the school; and as the
latter was less than half-an-hour’s

b. To develop the sense of
rhythmic and automatic
motor response to regular
accentuated pulses.
2. Steps
a. The teacher sings a part
of the first phrase with
loo.
b. The pupils sing the whole
melody with loo. (While
the pupils are singing
the teacher leads them
with the aid of some
rhythmic motion such as
clapping and swinging
of the hand or arm. It
will be found that the pu¬
pils can sing with any
neutral syllable as soon
as the song has been
learned; hence, the use
of the neutral syllable to
maintain the melody of a
familiar song.)
II. RECOGNITION OF PHRASE
REPETITION.
1. Purpose
a. Mastery of the phrases
in separate forms.
b. Immediate step towards
staff notation.
c. To make future sight
reading easy.
2. Steps
a. Concrete idea of the
phrase.
1. The teacher empha¬
sizes that a phrase pos¬
sesses a distinctive char¬
acteristic from the others.
She sings phrases and
illustrates the meaning
of a phrase by pausing a
little at the end of each
phrase.
b. Determination of t h e
number of phrases in the
song.
1. A pupil sings the first
phrase and after he has
sung it, let him remain
standing. The second
phrase will be sung by
another pupil who will
also remain standing
after he has sung the
phrase. Do the same
with the rest of the


phrases and after all the
phrases have been sung,
make the pupils under-
stand that the number of
phrases is represented by
the number of pupils
standing.
c. Designation of phrases
by curved lines or any
sign on the board.
1. Let the pupils sing the
song and tell them to
watch you as they are
singing.
2. As they are singing,
represent each phrase by
a curved line.
d. Singing the phrases as
indicated by the curved
lines at random.
1. Point to a phrase and
ask the pupils to sing it.
(Tell the children that as
you point to a phrase¬
represented by a curved
line—they are to sing it.
Note: The accomplishment in this
step should be a complete mas¬
tery of every phrase separately.
e. Recognition of phrases.
1. The teacher sings the
first phrase with words
and later with loo.
2. She asks a pupil to go
to the board and inclose
with his hands the phrase
that was sung.
3. She does the same
thing with the other
phrases even if they are
sung at random.
f. Comparison of similar
phrases.
1. Pupils sing the song


2. Ask them to deter¬
mine what phrases are
similar.
3. Mark the similar
phrases with the same
sign.

LAGUNA
Enrolment rapidly increased this
school year at the Laguna High
School, where there are now more
than five hundred students. The
first year consists of six sections,
the second year, four; and third
and fourth years, three sections.
Class organizations were form¬
ed in all classes in the high school,
and officers elected. Each organi¬
zation is under the supervision of
an adviser.
The Laguna High School orches¬
tra was also re-organized under the
direct supervision of its able ad¬
viser, Miss Amparo Kamatoy. Its
members were selected from dif-
ferent units of the province.
Military drill was again intro¬
duced and many future soldiers of
the Philippines have been seen
drilling in the athletic field. Se¬
lection of officers has already been
done. Mr. Julian Sandique is in
charge.
The first activity of the orches¬
tra made it the center of attraction
in a program held in honor of Dr.
Jose Rizal, whose birthday was ce¬
lebrated by the whole high school.
Declamations, songs, and a drama
featured the program. All the high
school students attended, as well as
members of the faculty.—Rodolfo

The Soil
By AMBROSIO P. BAYAN


- O you know that the primary
needs in life, as well as those
D things we love—the flowers,
the birds, and the butterflies¬
come partly, directly or indirectly,
from the soil? Indeed, our very
lives depend upon the soil. And
yet, how many of us shudder at the
sight of soil, especially if it is in
it’s muddy, ugly state? Now, that
always trodden, often so lowly
estimated soil, what is it?
The child sees it as something
simple. “Why is there soil?”
once asked a child. After a mo¬
ment he looked up and answered,
“Because we need it, it is a gift
from God.” The answer may seem
an innocent one but probably it is


the best that can be offered.
The layman views the soil as
something common and natural. It
is the surface of the earth and as
such it includes mud, dust, dirt,
and other things lowly and com¬
monplace.
To the poet, however, the soil
presents the endless wonders of
nature. He sees through it the
beautiful landscape, the singing
streams of inspiration, “the vast
seas of foliage in all shades of
green.” And the attractive birds
and butterflies, too, that roam from
flower to flower. Finally, he sees
through it—Man, with his fears
and hopes, joys and sorrows, loves
and dreams!
The agriculturist is more prac¬
tical. The soil is the surface of
the earth resulting from the disin¬
tegration of rock fragments, decay
of plant and animal matters; or it
may be any media that grows
plants. With the help of nature’s
bounteous gifts, the soil easily be¬
comes the source of life. It con¬
stitutes the only inexhaustible
natural resource of a nation.
But the soil is not altogether
simple. Soil study is broad and
complicated and to understand at
least a few of the numerous "soil
mysteries," one must have a basic
knowledge of the biological, chem¬
ical, and physical sciences, aside
from a working knowledge of phy¬
siography, climatology, and geo¬


logy.
In spite of the great advances
made in the study of soils in dif-
ferent parts of the world, we are
still far from having a complete


knowledge of them. Especially is
this true of Philippine soils. There
are, indeed, innumerable "soil mys¬
teries" that yet remain to be solved.


His Masterpiece
By GUILLERMO L. FERNANDEZ


NCE upon a time, there lived
a creature known as a liter¬

ary editor. He had a boss
who was strict, a boss in the real
sense of the word. This boss held
no reverence for the literary edit¬
or, and had appointed him to his
position simply because he felt that
a magazine without anything liter¬
ary is like an omelet without eggs!
Now the literary editor was a
zealous follower of his art. He had
a very prolific mind, and his works
were pronounced “great.” It was
also through his efforts that the
magazine became a popular ally of
embryo writers. In no time his
name became honey on the lips of
literary folk.


But there was one particular in¬
terested party who caused the of-
fice an endless source of trouble by
sending in manuscripts which were
obviously related to trash. This
young man had constantly received
frank, severe remarks from the lit-
erary editor, but there were no
signs of his progress. It was for
such frank criticisms that the lit-
erary editor won a wide reputa¬
tion.
Now, in the intoxication of his
glory, this editor decided to write
his masterpiece. It was intended
to out-Chesterton G. K. Chester¬
ton, or to out-Galsworthy John
Galsworthy. In other words, it
was to be great.
Well, he wrote it. He put his
whole soul into it—not to mention
his sweat. It did not turn out to
be as great as he expected, but he
considered it good enough. He did
not show it to anyone, because he
wanted to surprise his public.
But very suddenly, Fate turned


the tables on him. One afternoon,
the wind blew the original manu¬
script from his table, while he was
away, and carried it out of the
window in the direction of the am-
bitious young man, who was walk¬
ing up and down the street, en¬
deavoring to get a glimpse of “the
great, erudite fellow" who had fed
him up with rejection slips. He
picked the manuscript up, and
after reading a part of it, a scheme
glinted in his mind.
The next morning found the lit-
erary editor hustling into the of-
fice in a ferocious mood. He had
discovered the loss of his master¬
piece, and regretted very much
that he had not kept a copy of it.
At about eleven o’clock, two hours
after the mail had come in, the
strict boss came to his desk with a
manuscript in his hand and a
“Eureka” light in his eyes.
“It is a great story!” he cried,
handling the manuscript to the lit¬

Judgment by Compromise
After the attorney for the de-
fense and the fiscal have made their
pleadings, the judge gives his deci¬
sion. Every case always ends in
compromise, because the judge and
the town president usually agree
beforehand to give compromise for
a decision, so that all matters can
be settled amicably. The judge
clarifies his decision by pointing
out the mistakes of both parties.
It is interesting to note that
cases decided by this court always
ended happily, whether it be a
quarrel between husband and wife,
a dispute over boundaries, or a
physical fight.
Most Important Case
Of the dozen cases decided by
the rural court, that of Rafael Pa¬
raino and his wife was most im-
portant. The wife, as she had re-
ferred the case to the town pres¬
ident, wanted to leave her husband
for his failure to support her, es¬
pecially during the time when she
became sick. The president failed
to settle the case extra-legally, so
he referred the matter to the
juzgado rural.
The court tried the case, several
lawyers were even consulted before
the decision was rendered. The
judgment was that they should not
separate; and the judge even com-
manded both spouses to embrace
each other before the court, and
the husband to ask his wife’s for¬

erary editor. "And can you be¬
lieve it? It is from that unprogres¬
sive young man!"
The literary ed’s eyes dilated and
wanted to pop out of their sockets
when he read the manuscript be¬
fore him. It was his masterpiece!
He was speechless. Would his
hard-boiled boss believe him if he
said that it was his story? Could
he show enough proof? But all he
could do was to remain speechless.
No one could argue with a man like
his boss.
Well, you cannot imagine any¬
one more wretched and miserable
than that literary editor when the
story was finally put out, and the
young man received all the praise,
the admiration, and the glory it
evoked!


giveness, which he immediately did.
In turn, the wife said there was
nothing to be forgiven for. For
goodwill, the judge again ordered
the husband to embrace and kiss
his wife. These he did bashfully.
At present they are living together,
and they have not had another
quarrel since the judge told them
to live together as a good husband
and wife.
To the simple tao Urdaneta’s
juzgado rural is a true court of
justice; to the enlightened class
this court is a mockery. What have
you to say?

AS A THIEF

Continued from page 43
walk from the station, I could
reach it in good time without hur-
rying.
As I walked at an easy pace
through the busily populated
streets, I turned over the events of
the afternoon with rather mixed
feelings. In spite of my great con¬
fidence in Thorndyke, I was sensi¬
ble of a chill of disappointment in
respect alike of his words and his
deeds. In this rather farcical grub¬
bing about in the dismantled house


there was a faint suggestion of
charlatanism; of the vulgar, melo¬
dramatic sleuth, nosing out a trail;
while, as to his hair-splitting ob¬
jections to a piece of straightfor¬
ward evidence, they seemed to me
to be of the kind at which the usual
hard-headed judge would shake his
hard head while grudgingly allow¬
ing them as technically admissible.
But whither was Thorndyke
drifting? Evidently he had turned
a dubious eye on Wallingford; and
that egregious ass seemed to be
doing all that he could to attract
further notice. But to-day I had
seemed to detect a note of suspicion
in regard to Madeline; and even
making allowance for the fact that
he had not my knowledge of her
gentle personality, I could not but
feel a little resentful. Once more,
Wallingford’s remarks concerning
a possible mare’s nest and a
public scandal recurred to me,
and, not for the first time, I was
aware of faint misgivings as to my
wisdom in having set Thorndyke
to stir up these troubled waters.
He had, indeed, given me fair warn¬
ing, and I was half-inclined to re¬
gret that I had not allowed myself
to be warned off. Of course,
Thorndyke was much too old a
hand to launch a half-prepared pro¬
secution into the air. But still,
could not but ask myself uneasily
whither his overacute inferences
were leading him.
These reflections brought me to
the gate of the school, where I
learned from the porter that Made¬
line had not yet left and accord¬
ingly sent up my card. In less than
a minute she appeared, dressed in
her out-of-door clothes and wreathed
in smiles, looking, I thought, very
charming.


“How nice of you, Rupert!" she
exclaimed, “to come and take me
home. I was wondering how soon
you would come to see my little
spinster lair. It is only a few min¬
utes’ walk from here. But I am
sorry I didn’t know you were com¬
ing, for I have arranged to make a
call—a business call—and I am due
in about ten minutes. Isn’t it a
nuisance?”
"How long will you have to
stay?
“Oh, a quarter of an hour, at
least. Perhaps a little more.”
“Very well. I will wait outside
for you and do sentry-go.”
No, you won't. I shall let you
into my flat—I should have to pass
it—and you can have a wash and
brush-up, and then you can prowl
about and see how you like my lit¬
tle mansion—I haven’t quite settled
down in it yet, but you must over¬
look that. By the time you have
inspected everything, I shall be
back and then we can consider
whether we will have a late tea or
an early supper. This is the way."
She led me into a quiet by-street,
one side of which was occupied by
a range of tall, rather forbidding
buildings whose barrack-like aspect
was to some extent mitigated by
signs of civilized humanity in the
tastefully curtained windows. Made¬
line’s residence was on the second
floor, and when she had let me in
by the diminutive outer door and
switched on the light, she turned
back to the staircase with a wave
of her hand.
"I will be back as soon as I can,
she said. “Meanwhile go in and
make yourself at home."
I stood at the door and watched
her trip lightly down the stairs un¬
til she disappeared round the an¬
gle, when I shut the door and pro¬
ceeded to follow her injunctions to
the letter by taking possession of
the bathroom, in which I was gra¬
tified to find a constant supply of
hot water. When I had refreshed
myself by a wash, I went forth and
made a leisurely survey of the lit-
tle flat. It was all very character¬
istic of Madeline, the professional
exponent of Domestic Economy, in
its orderly arrangement and its
evidences of considered convenience.
The tiny kitchen reminded one of
a chemical laboratory or a doctor’s
dispensary with its labelled jars of
the cook’s materials set out in or¬
dered rows on their shelves, and
the two little mortars, one of
Wedgewood ware and the other of
glass. I grinned as my eye lighted
on this latter and I thought of the
fragments carefully collected by
Thorndyke and solemnly transported
to the Temple for examination.
Here, if he could have seen it, was
evidence that proved the owner¬
ship of that other mortar and at
the same time demolished the sig-
nificance of that discovery.
I ventured to inspect the bed-
room, and a very trim, pleasant lit¬
tle room it was; but the feature
which principally attracted my at¬
tention was an arrangement for
switching the electric light off and

THE JEWS IN PALESTINE

on from the bed—an arrangement
suspiciously correlated to a small
set of bookshelves also within easy
reach of the bed. What interested
me in it was what Thorndyke would
have called its “unmechanical in¬
genuity”; for it consisted of no
more than a couple of lengths of
stout string, of each of which one
end was tied to the light-switch and
the other end led by a pair of screw¬
eyes to the head of the bed. No
doubt the simple device worked well
enough in spite of the friction at
each screw-eye, but a man of less
intelligence than Madeline would
probably have used levers or bell¬
cranks, or at least pulleys to dim¬
inish the friction in changing the
direction of the pull.
There was a second bedroom, at
present unoccupied and only par¬
tially furnished and serving, appar¬
ently, as a receptacle for such of
Madeline’s possessions as had not
yet had a permanent place assigned
to them. Here were one or two
chairs, some piles of books, a num¬
ber of pictures and several polished
wood boxes and cases of various
sizes; evidently the residue of the
goods and chattels that Madeline
had brought from her home and
stored somewhere while she was
living at Hilborough Square. I ran
my eye along the range of boxes,
which were set out on the top of a
chest of drawers. One was an old¬
fashioned tea-caddy, another an
obvious folding desk of the same
period, while a third, which I
opened, turned out to be a work-box
of mid-Victorian age. Beside it
was a little flat rosewood case
which looked a small case of mathe¬
matical instruments. Observing
that the key was in the lock, I
turned it and lifted the lid, not
with any conscious curiosity as to
what was inside it, but in the mere
idleness of a man who has nothing
in particular to do. But the instant
that the lid was up my attention


awoke with a bound and I stood
with dropped jaw staring at the in-
terior in utter consternation.
There could be not an instant’s
doubt as to what this case was, for
its green-baize-lined interior showed
a shaped recess of the exact form
of a pocket pistol; and, if there
were not enough, there, in its own
compartment was a little copper
powder-flask, and in another com¬
partment about a dozen globular
bullets.
I snapped down the lid and
turned the key and wa’ked guiltily
out of the room. My interest in
Madeline’s flat was dead. I could
think of nothing but this amazing
discovery. And the more I thought,
the more overpowering did it be¬
come. The pistol that fitted that
case was the exact counterpart of
the pistol that I had seen in Thorn¬
dyke’s laboratory; and the case, it¬
self, corresponded exactly to his
description of the case from which
that pistol had probably been taken.
It was astounding; and it was pro¬
foundly disturbing. For it admit¬
ted of no explanation that I could
bring myself to accept other than
that of a coincidence. And coin¬
cidences are unsatisfactory things;
and you can’t do with too many of
them at once.
Yet, on refection, this was the
view that I adopted. Indeed, there
was no thinkable alternative. And
really, when I came to turn the mat-
ter over, it was not quite so extra¬
ordinary as it had seemed at the
first glance. For what, after all,
was this pistol with its case? It
was not a unique thing. It was
not even a rare thing. Thorndyke
had spoken of these pistol and cases
as comparatively common things
with which he expected me to be
familiar. Thousands of them must
have been made in their time, and
since they were far from perish-
able, thousands of them must still
exist. The singularity of the coin-


cidence was not in the facts; it was
the product of my own state of
mind.
Thus I sought—none too success¬
fully—to rid myself of the effects of
the shock that I had received on
raising the lid of the case; and I
was still moodily gazing out of the
sitting room window and arguing
away my perturbation when I heard
the outer door shut and a moment
later Madeline looked into the room.
“I haven’t been so very long, have
I?” she said, cheerily. "Now
will slip off my cloak and hat and
we will consider what sort of meal
we will have; or perhaps you will
consider the question while I am
gone."
With this she flitted away; and
my thoughts, passing by the prob¬
lem submitted, involuntarily re¬
verted to the little rosewood case
in the spare room. But her absence
was of a brevity suggesting the
performance of the professional
quick-change artist. In a minute
or two I heard her approach and
open the door; and I turned—to
receive a real knock-out blow.
I was so astonished and dismayed
that I suppose I must have stood
staring like a fool, for she asked in
a rather disconcerted tone:
“What is the matter, Rupert?
Why are you looking at my jumper
like that? Don’t you like it?”
“Yes,” I stammered, "of course
I do. Most certainly. Very charm¬
ing. Very—er—becoming. I like
it—er—exceedingly.”
“I don’t believe you do," she said,
doubtfully, "you looked so surprised
when I first came in. You don’t
think the colour too startling, do
you? Women wear brighter co¬
lours than they used to, you know,
and I do think this particular shade
of green is rather nice. And it is
rather unusual, too."
“It is,” I agreed, recovering my¬
self by an effort. “Quite dis¬
tinctive." And then, noting that I


had unconsciously adopted Thorn-
dyke’s own expression, I added,
hastily, "And I shouldn’t describe
it as startling, at all. It is in per¬
fectly good taste."
"I am glad you think that," she
said, "for you certainly did look
rather startled at first, and I had
some slight misgivings about it my¬
self when I had finished it.
It
looked more brilliant in colour as a
garment than it did in the form of
mere skeins."
“You made it yourself, then?'
“Yes. But I don’t think I would
ever knit another. It took me
months to do, and I could have
bought one for very little more than
the cost of the wool, though, of
course, I shouldn’t have been able
to select the exact tint that I want-
ed. But what about our meal?
Shall we call it tea or supper?”
She could have called it break¬
fast for all I cared, so completely
had this final shock extinguished
my interest in food. But I had to
make some response to her eager
hospitality.
“Let us split the difference or
strike an average,” I replied. "We
will call it a 'swarry’—tea and un¬
usual trimmings."

pleasantly and pausing now and
then to ask my advice (which was
usually foolish and had to be
blandly rejected) and treating the

Then there are the cases of three


poor maestros who have been vic-
tims of abuse of authority. They
have been accused of misdemeanor
ranging from corporal punishment
and desecration of burial premises


to sedition and seduction filed be¬
fore the court of a certain justice
of the peace in a remote township
in Mindanao. All these unhappy in-
cidents tend to show that the iso¬


lation of the non-Christian pro¬
vinces from the office of the Bu¬
reau of Non-Christian Tribes is a
great handicap in checking anoma¬
lies committed by Mindanao offi¬
cials.
Mixed Allegiance
It is a lamentable fact but a
truth worth public knowledge that
in most cases appointive offi¬
cials, not to mention elected muni¬
cipal and provincial office holders,
stay in their respective positions
for half a dozen years or more.
While a few remain loyal to their
offices the majority sacrifice their
loyalty to service for friendship.
This is inevitable because most of
them, if not all, have become god-
fathers of children of the influen¬
tial in the community, acted as
sponsors in weddings, and secured
loans from Chinese merchants.
Worse is the greater attachment of
these officials to political satraps
than to the Commonwealth.
The necessity of careful selection
of the man for the post of Com-
missioner should not be lost sight
of in order to insure sound adminis¬
tration of the affairs of the non-
Christian provinces. The man se-
lected for the job should have con¬
spicuous administrative ability.
Full knowledge of the needs and hu¬
man traits of the non-Christian ele¬
ments should be one of his impor-
tant qualifications. Right now the
writer sees no administrator bet¬
ter fitted for the job than Teopis¬
to Guingona, the present Director
of the Bureau of Non-Christian
Tribes.

“This year — it’s Hudson".
You doubtless have heard that remark from
many who have seen and tried a number of
cars—Hudson among them.
There is a note of authority in the statement
—a certainty that comes after actually driv-
ing the new Hudson and experiencing all
that it offers which is better than the best
of other cars—even those costing far more.


You have heard about some of the facts
about the new Hudson. But words can only
convey a weak shadow of the reality. May
we hope that what you have heard is only
the opening chapter of the story—to be con¬
tinued behind the wheel of a new Hudson?
That wheel awaits your hands today. We
invite you to take it—to prove for yourself
how far the new Hudson exceeds anything
that you have heard about it — how far it
exceeds anything you have ever before ex¬
perienced in a motor car.

ities mediate in the wrangle be¬
tween the hacenderos and the lab¬
orers who have been driven away
from their lands
The planting season is nearing,
and the tenants would do anything
to keep from being hungry. The
financial crisis and rice shortage
will make the situation the more
serious. Add to this the insolent
and aggressive attitude of the
foremen and guards of haciendas,
and the unguided radicalism of the
tenants and squatters—and you
have a brewing hell.
This is further made more crit¬
ical by the belief that the local of¬
ficials and constabulary soldiers
are no more than spies and tools of
the hacenderos. On the other hand,
the attorneys of the tenants are
charged with being agitators, who
are more interested in filling their
pockets than in really helping the
poor.
According to Atty. Abalos, the
only solution to this problem is the
re-purchase of the haciendas by
the government and their redistri¬
bution in small parcels to the ten¬
ants, to be paid in easy install¬
ments. Otherwise, hell will break
loose soon.

MALACANANG WHIP
Continued from page 8
for which he is being punished will
mean permanent removal from his
office. Governor Arteche, it was
revealed in an investigation con¬
ducted by the department of the in¬
terior, is guilty of systematic per¬
secution, irregularities in the ad
ministration of the provincial jail,
and the calling of meetings of the
provincial board without notifying
Member Vicente A. Dira.
Former Secretary Sison recom¬
mended to the President before his
appointment to the court of appeals
that Arteche be only reprimanded
but President Quezon, dissatisfied
with the recommendation, returned
the papers to the department of the
interior. The new secretary, Elpi¬
dio Quirino, recommended that the
Samar executive be suspended for
one month.
In handing down his suspension
order, President Quezon incident¬
ally expressed a government policy
when he said:
“Abuse of authority is a very
serious fault in any public offi¬
cial whether appointive or elec
tive, and the higher the authority,
power and position of the offend¬
ing official the greater the fault.
Particularly should this govern¬
ment be rigid with offenders of
this sort, because we are in the
early days of self-government and
toleration of this kind of offense
on the part of public officials by
the Chief Executive may have
serious consequences in the fu¬
ture.
Other Suspensions
But the three officials mentioned


above are not “alone in the boat."
Sharing their fate also is one of
the oldest employees of the bureau
of audits, Adriano Rodenas. Rode¬
nas, the assistant cashier of the in¬
sular treasurer’s office, was sus¬
pended by Secretary Antonio de las
Alas of finance following the dis¬
covery of a shortage of P20,000 in
the funds entrusted to his care
The discovery was made in the
course of a check-up of the funds
of the treasury entrusted to the
care of the suspended assistant
cashier. Another functionary of
the government, Dr Francisco
Villaruz, director of the U. P. in¬
firmary in Los Banos, was sus¬
pended by President Bocobo as an
aftermath of the death of Miss Pi¬
lar Cruz, a nurse of the infirmary.
Director Fajardo is not the first
bureau head suspended by Presid
ent Quezon Director Balmaceda
of commerce was likewise suspend¬
ed by President Quezon in connec¬
tion with irregularities in the im-
portation of Saigon rice.


DROUGHT

dy agreed. There, he at least got
three meals a day.
Well, from that time on the rest
of the children that were old
enough went out as servants to peo¬
ple who could afford to keep them.
The youngest ones stayed home
with their parents...
When the drought I was telling
you about in the beginning came,
Manso’s aged mother came to live
with them. She was all dried up
and wrinkled and this time she
could hardly walk. The shack in
which they lived was built in such
a way that you had to walk up a
step when you went from the kit¬
chen to the main room. The old wo
man, who was always in the kit¬
chen before the fire, had to be help-
ed up the step every time she want-
ed to go to the main room. Manso
did not like doing this and one time
when Onda—that was what she
was called—was almost on the main
floor, he let go his hold and the
old woman doubled back and hit
her head on the stove. She cried
like a kitten and it was a long time
before she was able to move again.
One day in September, Tasia
went to town bringing some wild
vegetables with her to sell in the
market. There was not a grain of
rice in the house and the youngest
child was already yellow eating
corn. Tasia was going to buy a lit¬
tle rice with the money she could
get from the vegetables. She was
going to buy it for the child alone
the rest could eat corn and vegeta¬
bles. Even wild vegetables were
getting scarce this time, for since
the drought came almost every
one went to the woods to gather
them. Corn would not sprout when
you put it under the hot ground.
Tasia did not come home that
night but next morning she came
and she had three gantas of rice
with her. Everybody went to her
house to beg or buy a little of the
rice. The village folk did not cook


this rice in the usual way: they
made porridge of it with plenty of
water.
Tasia did not stay long that day¬
in the afternoon she went back to
town. She said she had a job as
maid-servant in a rich Spanish fa¬
mily there. Manso said nothing at
all and when Tasia left he was away
fishing. The old grandmother was
left alone with the sick child and
the rest of the children.
After that Tasia visited Nabitas
only twice a month, and as time
wore on she stayed away as long
as two months at a stretch. The
rest of the children who were away
as servants stayed away, too. When
the sick child died, someone—Pe¬
dro Flores it was, I think—was
sent to fetch Tasia.
Then one evening some months
later—this was about a year after
she had gone to work in town—Ta¬
sia came back carrying some rice
and a big bundle on top of her head.
It was her clothing. Manso had by
this time made up his mind to work
again. It had rained a little and he
had borrowed Ta Teban’s carabao,
agreeing to plow the latter’s field
free. When Tasia came home Man¬
so’s corn was already two feet from
the ground.
But Manso’s normal mental state
did not come back. As before he
still loved to "endividir”"—if he
could get someone to "endividir
with him. Sometimes he would
stay all day up in his sanggutan.
The neighbors feared he would doze
off and fall but nothing of the sort
happened.
When Tasia came home she was
pregnant and she told every one
she was discharged by the Spaniard
because she coudn’t work anymore.
Manso came down from his sang¬
gutan but when he saw Tasia he
didn’t say anything but instead got
his fish net and went to the brook.
The old grandmother was whim¬
pering like a hurt pup in the kit¬
chen. She called after Manso to
bring her some fish.
One morning a week later Manso
was cultivating his corn, plowing
them between the rows to admit
air to the roots. The old woman’s
cries attracted him and he left his
plow in the middle of the field and
hurried home. When he neared
the house he knew that Tasia was
giving birth. He climbed the steps
slowly and when he got inside he
saw Tasia huddled in the corner,
the old woman looking helplessly
and crying. The other children
were also crying.
Manso walked to Tasia, and when
he saw the baby wrapped in some
old clothes lying by her side, he
turned without a word and went
back to his plowing.

herself at the long mirror in the
door of the wardrobe.
She passed her hand over her
face, then over neck and breasts.
At her breast, her hand paused
while she looked intently at the
mirror. She jerked off her hand;


and suddenly, snatched a powder
puff and began powdering her face.
Then she lay down. Outside, in the
sala, the women’s talk went on in
punctuated monotone.
Anita closed her eyes, but they
opened and remained open with an
intent, still look in them. For a
few minutes she stared at the cei¬
ling, then her face contorted and
she began to move restlessly.
Through the curtained window
snatches of talk filtered in from
the neighboring house:
“That hunchback at the hall last
night is really crazy! Dancing the
tango! He looked like a crazy top!
A girlish laugh rang out.
“I wouldn’t dance with him if he
gave me all his money!"
“That’s why we are like this!”
a woman’s husky voice said. "You
are too choosy!"
Anita closed her eyes again. She
heard a scratching at the foot of
the bed and rose. “Puppy, she
whispered and lifted the small dog
beside her. It cuddled beside her,
and for the third time she tried to
sleep. She pressed her fingers to
the sides of her brow until wrin¬
kles appeared in her face, but sleep
would not come. Restlessly she
tossed on the bed and rolled over
the puppy. It yelped.
"Anita, is that dog there with
you?” her mother shouted.
Aling Marta rose and strode to
the bedroom. She snatched the pup-
py from the bed and threw it to
the floor and it scampered away,
whimpering, its tail between its
legs.
"Don’t be a fool! Get some sleep!
The car will be here early—you
know the trip to Mariquina is at
least one hour!” Then Aling Marta
stalked out.
If I were you, cumare," a voice
came from the sala, "I would not
have permitted her to attend that
school."
“Yes, really, Aling Marta," other
smug voices joined in. “It is
bad for her. She has almost no
sleep. See her complexion now!'
“She said she wanted to learn
some business, that’s why I let
her, Anita’s mother defended her¬
self.
"Why, is she thinking of not
dancing any more? Is she not earn¬
ing enough from dancing? There
are too many dressmakers now and
their business is poor!"
Her eyes closed and willing her¬
self to sleep, Anita heard her mo¬
ther’s answer: “No! No! She
isn’t quitting dancing! I permitted
her to study only to please her. She
is a little happier now that she is
attending that school. Did you not
notice her face when she arrived?
As she lay on the bed, Anita
slowly turned around and buried
her face in the pillow Her arms
stretched to the sides of the bed,
and her hands gripped them so
hard that her whole body trembled.

Miss Festejo Increases Lead
Miss Fallarme Jumps To Sixth Place


ISS Florentina Festejo, Ft.
L4 Stotsenburg (Pampanga)
candidate, again demonstrated her
strength in last Saturday’s count-
ing of votes in the P2,500-prize
beauty contest to select the ten
most beautiful girls of 1936 spon¬
sored by the Ramon Roces Pub¬
lications, Inc., when she main¬
tained her lead with 3,000 ad-
ditional votes. With a total of
18,500 votes already cast in her fa¬
vor, this youthful candidate has
left the other candidates way be¬
hind, with her leaders determined
to keep her at the top.
There were no changes in the po¬
sition of the next four leading
candidates, with the leaders of the
candidates satisfied to keep close
watch on the activities of the
other candidates. However, Miss
Asuncion Fallarme, who is sup¬
ported by the miners at Antamok
Mines, Baguio, registered the sur¬
prise of the counting when her
leaders cast 4,550 votes in her fa¬
vor, capturing sixth place, which
was previously held by Estela
Jackling of Manila. Miss Fallarme
was nominated during the last day
of the nomination.
Although last Saturday’s count-
ing was not as animated as pre¬
vious ones, with only 14,000 votes
being dropped in favor of fifteen
candidates, the results show that
some of the candidates are begin-
ning to demonstrate their reputed


on in a state of mental chaos and
bewilderment for which I can find
no words. There she was, my
friend, Madeline, sweet, gentle,
feminine—the very type of gracious
womanhood, and the more sweet
and gracious by reason of these
homely surroundings. For it is an
appalling reflection, in these days
of lady professors and women leg¬
islators, that to masculine eyes a
woman never looks so dignified, so
worshipful, so entirely desirable,
as when she is occupied in the
traditional activities that millen¬
niums of human experience have
associated with her sex. To me,
Madeline, flitting about the imma¬
culate little kitchen, neat-handed
perfect in the knowledge of her
homely craft; smiling, dainty, fra¬
gile, with her gracefully flowing
hair and the little apron that she
had slipped on as a sort of cere¬
monial garment, was a veritable
epitome of feminine charm. And
yet, but a few feet away was a
rosewood case that had once held
a pistol; and even now, in Thorn-
dyke’s locked cabinet—but my
mind staggered under the effort of
thought and refused the attempt to
combine and collate a set of images
so discordant.

strength. Miss Emma Gallardo
of Dumaguete, Oriental Negros,
polled 1,072 votes, enabling her to
skip over the heads of several
candidates ahead of her and plac¬
ing her among the twenty-five
leaders. Miss Anacoreta Cudilla
of San Nicolas, Manila, likewise
received a batch of votes amount¬
ing to 950 which enabled her to
retain her position among the ten
leaders. The Misses Bonifacio
Deocampo, Valentina Esquioja,
Victoria Hontiveros, Consuelo de
los Reyes, Nena Trazo, and Nenita
Valdez were also among those who
registered votes in the latest
counting.
The results of the first three
countings indicate that most of
the votes issued so far totalling
about 800,000, are still being held
by subscribers. If the subscribers
wish their respective candidates
to lead in this nation-wide beauty
contest, it is advisable that they
cast their votes as early as possi¬
ble.
As things are, the candidates of
the northern provinces are still oc¬
cupying the first three places in
the tilt. The next counting will
take place, as usual, at nine o’clock
next Saturday morning.

to 1315 hectares, 88 ares, and 44
centares. The following year, a new
survey by Rocafol expanded the
hacienda’s size to 2,705 hectares.
To-day the estate measures 2,997
hectares.
In defense, the hacienda has
brought out Torrens Titles cover¬
ing the disputed portions which
were issued in 1905. Also, it was
pointed out that for several years
the estate has been leasing its ter-
ritory to tenants, with the latter
cultivating the lands and raising
crops on them.
Claimants Make Entry
Just sometime ago an overseer
wired Mr. Lichauco, the owner, that
although the lawsuit has not been
terminated, free patent claimants
entered his hacienda and are now
building huts with the intention of
remaining in the disputed area. He
added that Philippine Army autho¬
rities at Tayug were advised of
this forcible entry, but the soldiers
have not done anything on the
ground that their duty is only to
prevent a fight between claimants
and hacienda tenants. They are
without orders to take any definite
action to oust the claimants.
Encouraged by this attitude of
the military authorities, the free
patent claimants filed suits against
the tenants for serious threats and
had the latter arrested. This oc¬
currence embittered the tenants,
and they are now in an ugly mood.
Owner Lichauco Speaks
Mr. Lichauco, hacienda owner,
explained that the present trouble
is not between him and his tenants,
but between tenants and free pa¬
tent claimants. He expressed fear
of trouble for his tenants.
If the court decides in favor of
the free patent claimants, we shall
be willing to abide by the court’s
decision,” Mr. Lichauco said.
Meanwhile, with the suit pending,
we won’t permit anybody to wrest
the disputed area from us or har¬
rass our tenants to the prejudice of
our interests and the tenants’ safe¬
ty. Our titles show that the lands
in dispute are parts of the hacien¬
da. Until the litigation is settled,
we want peace and order maintain¬
ed."
Public Defenders At Work
Public Defender Antonio Mejia
considers the agrarian trouble se¬
rious enough to cause sudden
bloodshed. He adds, however, that
the Philippine Army authorities at
Tayug can easily prevent it.
Rumors in Tayug also have it
that another public defender, An¬
tonio Paguia, is accelerating trou¬
ble with his rumored formation of
labor unions. Emilio Bundok, rep-
resentative of the claimants, and
Labor Leader Francisco Arzadon
are holding secret meetings in the
barrios and inducing farmers and
other barrio people to support the
cause of the claimants. The ar¬
rival of Defender Paguia and his
reported decision to join the Mun¬
dok-Arzadon movement have given


added impetus to the campaign.
Bad Blood Apparent
The hacienda tenants, through-
ly annoyed by entries of free pa¬
tent claimants, declared they are
willing to take the law in their
hands if the soldiers will not do
anything to protect their rights.
On the other hand, leaders of the
claimants said they will abide by
the court’s decision only if the
same is favorable to them.
From Attorney Delfin Ramirez
of the claimants, it was learned
that Judge Dionisio de Leon of
the Pangasinan court of first in¬
stance has intimated that the liti¬
gation will take two months to try,
even with hearings being held eve¬
ry day.

THE RICH HATE

Continued from page 7
the very rich. Surveying the pre¬
sent state of the nation—stock-
market boom, crowded Florida re¬
sorts, thronged night clubs, the re¬
vival of luxury spending—one
might almost imagine the fury of
the rich to be part of a subtle plot
to return Mr. Roosevelt to office.
Is that it then? To throw the
workers and the farmers off their
guard, the American rich are si¬
mulating this rage against the man
who—if one listens to the other
side—has been their savior?
But such choler could not be si¬
mulated. Anyone who has seen it
now and then at close range must
be aware that it is too authentic
for that.
While this phenomenon has gone
virtually unrecorded, it is familiar
to most middle-class people to-day.
Indeed, it has had its influence
upon the middle class. There are
those who have been only too
eager to pick up crumbs of emo¬
tion dropped from the rich man’s
table. In general, however, the
violence of the hatred varies di¬
rectly with the affluence of the
social group. The larger the house,
the more numerous the servants,
the more resplendent the linen
and silver, the more scathing is
likely to be the indictment of the
President.
Other Hated Presidents
In part, of course, Mr. Roose¬
velt’s lot has been that of other
Presidents, and particularly Dem¬
ocratic Presidents. Grover Cleve¬
land came in for much sheer
abuse. Theodore Roosevelt, Re¬
publican though he was, was cor¬
dially hated by big business in his
trust-busting days. It is ironic that
the memory of both Cleveland and
Theodore Roosevelt is now invok¬
ed to shame the present President
Roosevelt. Woodrow Wilson also
brought down the wrath of the
gods by his program of reforms;
the masters of finance and indus¬
try forgave him only under the
exigencies of war.
Most observers are agreed, how¬
ever, that those earlier rages can¬

——PORTRAIT of the


WEEK-


Monday, June 22


Very laudable
is Pres. Quezon’s
idea of reorganiz¬
ing the civil ser¬
vice to render it
more efficient,
and to make it
conform to the
mandatory provi¬
sions of the Con¬
stitution. T hi s
plan will be
brought to the of-
ficial notice of the National Assem¬
bly when the President makes his
budget message tomorrow after¬
hoon. 
Frank Murphy, American high
commissioner, now at Washington
will suggest to Pres. Roosevelt that
preliminary conversations attend¬
ing the proposed U.S.-P.I. economic
agreement be held in September.
“No legislation prejudicial to P.I.
should be enacted,” he said *ix
As a solution to this year’s
school crisis, the National Assem¬
bly will vote for an emergency ap-
propriation bill carrying P800,000
for distribution to different elem¬
entary schools. The Assembly even
plans to have one half of the cedu¬
la collections reserved for educa¬
tion purposes, *an
Because rains have set in, an
additional P60,000 is needed by Ma¬
nila for the repair of city streets
and other public works projects.*xx
Laguna still reeks with jueteng
was the finding of Interiorman
Quirino who made a surprise visit
to Laguna. This discovery belies
the assurance of Governor Cailles
that jueteng has been wiped out
from his province long ago. sax
Galia Arellano, said to have
gained fame in European musical
circles, returned this morning with
her daughter Maria after a seven
years’ stay abroad. ax
The increase in the 1936 P. I.
sugar quota to 1,098,738 short tons
will not benefit the local sugar in¬
dustry because this year’s crop is
estimated to fall short by about
69,000 short tons. *an
Because nine of
ten questions giv¬
en in the last
CPA tests were
included in the
r eVi e w ques¬
tions given a cer¬
tain college two
days previous to
the tests by a
member of the
board of examin- A. de las Alas
ers, cancellation of the last gov-
ernment examination for certified
accountants will be ordered by Fi¬
nancemen A. de las Alas. The ex¬
aminer responsible for the leakage
will be punished with dismissal.*ax
When Teofilo Espineli, 18, of
Barrio Alulod, Indang, Cavite, open¬


Pres. Quezon


ed the door of his house last night,
a mysterious marksman blasted out
his eyes with birdshot from a dou¬
ble-barrelled shotgun.kk
Pres. Quezon intends to submit
all appointments to important gov¬
ernment vacancies in a batch to
the National Assembly. 
A voluminous bill providing for
the creation of a general retirement
and gratuity system, abolishing all
existing retirement and pension
systems, and amending the accrued
and vacation leave laws, was filed
in the National Assembly by the
committee on pensions. The bill
does not require the government to
contribute to the fund, other than
the salary saving. *ax
Raja Muda will be crowned Sul¬
tan of Sulu on June 27th. Princess
Dayang Dayang, acting sultan,
agreed to this on condition that her
father-in-law, Datu Amilbangsa, be
made crown prince, *xn
Mussolini a n -
nounced that four¬
fifths of his 500,-

workm en in

Ethiopia will re¬
main as settlers.
He calculates that
the new African
empire will be
fully developed af¬
ter fifty years B. Mussolini

William N. Bish, manager of the
Trans-Pacific Trading Co., died at
Saint Joseph’s hospital yesterday of
double pneumonia. He was 61 years
eld. *
The obvious omission of Con¬
gress to place an excise tax on
babassu oil, caused U.S. experts to
predict heavy importations from
Brazil to the detriment of P.I. coco¬
nut oil. a4
Lope de la Rosa, notorious ban¬
dit, struck again as he attempted to
hold up a commercial truck near
Barrio Bitukang Manok, Laur, N.
E., with five men. Several truck
passengers were injured. 
Some 16,264 hectares in 13 pro¬
vinces are infested with locusts, re-


ported the plant industry bureau.
Jorge Vargas the President’s secre¬
tary, received reports that the pres¬
ident of Catanauan (Tayabas) has
been negligent in conducting locust
campaigns. *a
Pres. Quezon will leave for
Cebu this coming Friday to inspect
the Cebu railroad and cement plant,
also to lay the cornerstone for the
provincial capitol, *ax
Tuesday, June 23
Two physicians will be accused
of homicide for the untimely death
in St. Luke’s hospital last week of
Pilar Cruz, 24, nurse at the U.P.
infirmary in Los Banos, Laguna.
Police findings revealed that the
girl’s death came following two ope¬
rations and an infection. Mean¬
while, the case of Dr. Francisco Vi¬
llaruz, director of the Los Banos

Pres. Quezon, in a special bud¬
get message, recommends the re-
peal of the Belo Act effective Jan¬
uary 1, 1938; also he has made
known the reorganization of the


merchant of the Ohio State Univ¬
ersity, during the National Col¬
legiate track and field meet held in
Chicago the other Saturday. The
former record, held jointly by Ed¬
die Tolan, Percy Williams, and R.
Metcalfe, was 10.3 seconds. Owens
also copped the 200-meter run in
21.3 seconds, the 200-meter hurdles,
and the running broad jump.
SWIMMING
The Aterican record in the
880-yard free style was broken by
Ralph Flanagan of Miami last June
21st during the National A.A.U.
swim held in Des Moines, la., when
he made the distance in 10 minutes
7 seconds. Likewise a new Amer¬
ican record in the 300-meter indi¬
vidual medley was established by
Paul Wolf of Los Angeles: 4 min¬
utes 2.4 seconds.

BOXING
The New York State Athletic
Commission last week announced
that it would recognize Mike Bel¬
loise of New York as the world’s
featherweight champion, declared
further that it could not recognize
the world title claims of Petey Sar¬
ron, who recently dethroned Freddie
Miller, because it had never recog¬
nized Miller’s championship claims.

Thirty-three years a government
employee, Adriano Rodenas, acting
assistant cashier of the bureau of
treasury, was found short of
P20,000 of the P30,000,000 under
his care. In defense, Rodenas said
the last cash check-up was in 1933
when all money were found in¬
tact, since then he was out many
times, with Catalino Ramos and
Gregorio Leones receiving the
keys to the treasury vaults, and
it must have been during those
periods when the P20,000 got lost.
He backed his defense with the
long services as assistant treasur¬
er of the Phil. Carnival, and ca¬
shier of the last two sweepstakes.
A complaint will be filed against

did for Wilson, to dissolve the fu¬

COMMENTS
THAT PARDON  ENJAMIN BARRUGA, triple-killer, until
D his sentence was commuted by the President
to life imprisonment a candidate for the electric chair, is said to have
cried with happiness when informed that he had been saved from exe¬
cution. And well he might. Ordinarily, considering how he committed
the murders, only one such murder would be enough to forfeit his life.
He has taken three lives. And he still lives.
There may be good arguments against capital punishment. And if
the people of this country are convinced that capital punishment does
nobody any good, then it is time we abolished it here.
But as long as capital punishment is allowed by the laws of the land
and there is no limit to the pardoning power of the Chief Executive,
there will be something of a confusion as to what kind of murder one can
commit to deserve death for the crime.
If ever there is a case of a person getting away with murder,
Barruga is it. It may be true, as claimed, that Barruga was convicted
mainly on circumstantial evidence. But considering that for a death
sentence to be upheld, the supreme court must pass on the sentence and
vote unanimously, a single dissenting vote will save the condemned, the
circumstantial evidence which condemned Barruga to death must have
been convincing enough to drive out the least doubt in the minds of the
members of the supreme court that Barruga deserved the supreme pe¬
nalty.
The President is within his rights by virtue of the office he holds.
in saving Barruga’s life. But we like to believe that in this instance
the public which believes in capital punishment where it is deserved
will prefer to stay on the side of the supreme court with respect to the
price the saved killer must pay for three murders.
* *
IT CAN BE HARDER mHE idea behind any punishment is sim¬
I ply this: to discourage, in addition to
atonement, further lapses from good conduct. Judged by this, the kind
of punishment usually meted out to erring public officials is not suf¬
ficiently corrective or these officials are incorrigibles.
Perhaps under the present laws no heavier punishments can be im-
posed for misbehavior in office. If this is so, and if the object is highe:
efficiency and morality in public offices, it is time the laws were altered
to permit heavier penalties. Expulsion, for one thing, may be tried.
* *
ONLY FAIR CECRETARY Alas has been quoted as saying:
 “When a vacancy occurs in the case of the chie"
of a division, that position will be filled by the man next in rank. No
outsider will be appointed to that position. Political influence will not
be of any consideration in such cases."
The object of this, it is said, is to keep the morale of the employees
high and encourage them to perform their duties more efficiently and
honestly.
This is significant because Secretary Alas’ new policy and its .st¬
ification very pointedly indicate admission of a long suspected vicious
practice of invalidating merit in favor of influence in government pro¬
motions. The average citizen cannot help feeling disappointed that this
practice should be condemned by high officials only now when they know
full well that the practise has been of long standing and is resposiba for
the low efficiency of government workers.
Nevertheless, the public can be thankful enough, late as the awaken¬
ing of official conscience is, that there is promise that ambitious, hard-
working employees, at least in Sec. Alas’ department, will be encouraged
to work for all they are worth with the promise that when the appor-
tunity for advancement comes no fathead from the outside or else chere,
as before, will come along armed with potent recommendation ar grab
the opportunity away.


By The EDITOR


July 2,


China should be thankful Ji
is so playful she can’t help cu
her for the fun of it. For the
is nothing like a cuffing or a
in the pants for flabbiness
weak knees.
And some day Japan will rue
day she practised on China to
fect her aim and shooting te
nique.
It is a human trait to want to d
some cuffing and kicking in
pants yourself for the benefit
the fellow who had such a fine
time doing just that sort of exen
cise at your expense.
He who cuffs last cuffs best and
China will have a good laugh yet.
We have always wondered why
the average run of labor leaders
look extremely flabby and well-fed.
Why legislators find time to get
excited about Mindanao idle lands
and corner-stone laying and fail to
get sufficiently aroused to call on
Central Luzon tenants who, if
you will believe the reports in
Manila papers, are about to fal
into fancy trouble-making.
Why Manila streets continue to
look like miniature relief maps on
extremely mountainous territor
(all humps and no valleys) whe
out there in the City Hall they ard
already frothing about suspendin
pay cuts in view of the existing
opulence of the city treasury.
Why they keep money in the
treasury in such a manner that a
responsible official who develo
an itchy palm all of a sudden can
pick up a few thousand peso;
without anyone getting wise to it
until maybe five years later.
Why Gov. Cailles of Laguna
who knows his province and cer¬
tainly his own family, thinks there
is no such thing as jueteng in the
province and Sec. Quirino who
roosts in Manila thinks there is.
Why this country is so poor in
first class brains that the idea of a
new deal in the government is no
more than a shuffle.
And why the Board of Pardons
knows more about the value of cir¬
cumstantial evidence than all the
justices of the supreme court bun¬
dled together.
