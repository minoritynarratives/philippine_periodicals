TE said before that our readers
 would hear again from Judge Gui¬
llermo Guevara, and we were not,
sy any means, just being playful. For
this week we have the judge again (page
1) and this time he is, so to speak, wash-
ino family linen in public, exposing the
judiciary of which he was once a mem¬
ber.
You may not be a lawyer, but you
anastad in the message of


che shortcomings of the iotal.
From the judicial let’s turn to the
semal: well, to manners in particular. It
ssems there is a great deal of lament over
the passing of old ways. Assistant Di¬
rector Eulogio B. Rodriguez of the Na¬
tional Library no less, thinks courtesy
(page 9) is waning in this country of
ours. But before you agree with Assist-
ant Director Rodriguez we beseech you
to read what Mrs. Paz Marquez-Benitez
of the department of English, U. P., has
written on the subject (page 8). It is not
often that you come across the writings
of this accomplished lady, less often,
across an attitude towards contemporary
life as hers.
r E would suggest to women who are
under the impression that they are
a negieted portion of society to read
Women Are Not So Helpless by a staff
member who, really, should know about
legal stulf he being a lawyer After read¬
ing this, you can’t convince us, my dear
young lady the brute took advantage of

They Do Not Want To Work


TROM time to time we hear of hunger stalking many people
in different parts of the country. These people are unem¬
ploved, so it is claimed; therefore, if they are not helped by the
nment they will be hungry.
Any should unemployment be necessarily linked
with hunger for the unemployed in this country? Must
a worker who has lost his employment fold his hands and
wait for an employment that will suit him even if he
starve while waiting? Cannot he, while waiting for a
profitable job, roll up his sleeves, use his own hands if he
must, and earn what little he can if only for his meals and
those of the members of his family? Why must he be
hungry here when with a little effort he can raise enough
to sustain life?
It is, of course, every citizen’s right to look for such employ¬
ment which will give more than the requirements for food and
helter, for, after all, life should ma a more than three meals a
4 a roof to sleep under
ut there is no excuse.


barring physical disability, for hunger.
The President rightly emphasized last eek that the
man who starves in this country is the may, vho does not
want to work. Said the President further "Any unem¬
ployed citizen of this country who is not fraid to work
and who is in earnest about earning a livig can come to
me and I will give him a job. Of course Wwill make him
take off his coat and his fine shirt and nike him sweep
the streets.
And it should be added that in most cas-the men who are
loudest in crying about unemployment are t men who do not
want to leave the comforts of city life andig towns, who do
not want to soil their clothes and callouse thehands, who are too
cowardly to face the home town crowd bec:e the crowd would
think them failures.
These men only believe they are iking for employ¬
ment. The fact is they do not reallyant to work.

His Excelleney The
President. Talking
A Resume Of The Presidents
Statements At Last Week's
Press Conference


His Excellency, President Quezon,
speaking before a crawd.


ALACANANG press confer¬
ences were no rarities in
M qe time of American gov¬
ernors-general.
Under almost all of them—from
Taft to Murphy (with the possible
exception of Wood and Gilmore)
—newsmen had access to the pre¬
sence of the chief executive almost
any day in the week.
President Quezon undoubtedly
believes that absence makes the
heart grow fonder, and so meets
the newspaper boys only once a
week: every Friday, usually from
10:30 a. m. to 1:30 p.m.


QUIRINO BECOMES INTERIOR
SECRETARY
Former Secretary of Finance
Quirino was appointed by President
Quezon secretary of the Department
of the Interior last Saturday to take
the place of former Secretary Sison
who had born appointed judge of
the Court of Appeals. Shortly after
the announcement of the appoint-
ment, Assemblyman Lavides of Ta¬
vabas said he would introduce a bill
abolishing the Department of the
Interior and creating a Department
of State.


Last week’s press conference
started promptly at 10:30 a.m. At
the appointed hour, Col. Garfinkel
emerged from the cabinet room and
announced: “The Press,” and led
the way for the representatives of
foreign and local press.
The President, seated at the head
of the cabinet table, asked, "Any
particular question you want to ask,
ladies and gentlemen?”
This time, there was but one lady
and thirteen gentlemen. The lady,
Mrs. C. E. Nathorst, represents
the London News.
Among the questions asked was
about the suspension of the pay¬
ment of salaries of ineligible em¬
ployees of the sweepstakes office.
“The question requires serious
study,” the President said. “Our
decision in this case will likely af¬
fect thousands of employees in all
government companies, like the
National Development Company,
the Manila Hotel, the Manila Rail¬
road, and others.”
The President indicated that he
would appoint new judges to the
vacancies created in the court of
first instance pretty soon. The
same, he indicated, will be true with
the remaining vacancy in the
Court of Appeals. “The adminis¬
tration of justice will greatly suf¬
fer if appointments to these vacan-
cies are not made soon,” he said.
He wants the right men for these
vacancies and is awaiting the re¬
commendation of Secretary Yulo.
In connection with his trip to
Lian, Batangas, the President inci¬
dentally stated his policy with re-
gards to the government purchase
of private estates.
He said that such purchases


would involve big sums of money
and he wants to be very sure the
government would be able to get its
money back.
In selling lots in any hacienda
purchased by the government he
said he would see to it that the
wrong practices of the past will
not be repeated.
In some estates purchased in the
past by the government, he de-
clared, some influential politicians
were able to secure large tracts of
land. This happened in Cavite, he
added. There, influential politi¬
cians purchased large tracts of
land and either sold lots or rented
spaces to tenants. This will never
happen again under his adminis¬
tration, President Quezon declared.
For the first time since he be¬
came President of the Common-
wealth, President Quezon touched on
the delicate agrarian question. “I
am aware of the fact that social un¬
rest in the Philippines is mainly
due to agrarian troubles.” The
President is making a conclusive
and thorough study to remedy
these troubles.
President Quezon has ordered the
department of labor to make an
investigation into the root of the
trouble between tenants and land¬
lords. This is the first time such
a project is being undertaken in the
Philippines. After studying the
report of the Department of Labor,
President Quezon hopes to recom¬
mend an effective measure to re¬
medy the situation to the National
Assembly.
The present law which was pre-
pared to solve agrarian conflicts
is very ineffective, according to
President Quezon. The law pro¬


vides, he said, that municipal coun¬
cils should pass resolutions adopt-
ing the measure. “No municipal
council," said President Quezon,
“has done that yet."
“The new law which I expect te
recommend to the National Assem¬
bly will give no exemptions. It will
be enforced to all, whether we like
it or not,” he also announced.

not a mere “valley of tears,” the

has remained stationary and has
not contributed any great

moral and social ailments.
Anachronistie Judicial Procedure
If justice delayed is justice de¬
nied, then it can be said that in our
country the denial of justice is more
of a general rule than an exception,
due largely to the anachronism in
our judicial procedure.
Thirty-five years ago, a mort-
gage creditor who desired to fore¬
close his mortgage, had to wait pa¬


tiently and with resignation for the
following periods to elapse: 20 days
after notice for the appearance of
the defendant if the latter could be
found within the province and 40
days if the latter was outside the
province; 10 days for the filing of
the demurrer; 5 days for the fil-
ing of the answer or for amending
the complaint; 30 days of anxiety
waiting for the court’s decision; 10
days for presenting the bill of ex¬
ceptions; 120 days for the prepa¬
ration of the brief; 90 days within
which the judgment debtor may
pay his debt according to the judg¬
ment of the court; and 20 days for
the publication of the notice of the
public auction sale.
If to all these dificrent periods
we add the time that might be con¬
sumed by the long and vexatious
trial, with its endless examinations

Shameful Result
To this unhappy combination of
an anachronistic judicial procedure,
the lack of practical sense of trial
judges, and the legal cunning of
lawyers, may be attributed the
shameful phenomenon which we
witnessed not long ago in which a
criminal case for estafa monop¬
clized all the time and attention of
a court of first instance for a pe¬
riod of two years and a half during
which time trials were often held
till 12 o’clock in the evening to hear
the testimonies of several scores of
witnesses and to examine about
43,000 exhibits and some 50,000
pages of stenographic notes. Amer¬


ica which, according to some critics,
is known for its less practical and
expeditious way of administering
penal justice because of her jury
system, has left our country far be¬
hind by disposing, in about twelve
months, of one of the most compli¬
cated and most sensational criminal
cases in the whole world—the cel¬
ebrated Lindbergh-Hauptmann case.
We, on the other hand, in order to
hear and dispose of a case of fraud
had to devote to it the exclusive at¬
tention of two judges, one after the
other. A period of two years and
a half not being sufficient, five
years had to be allotted for its final
disposal.
And to aggravate the irony, the
two judges who were responsible
for the admission of 43,000 exhib-
its and the transcription of about


50,000 pages of stenographic notes,
instead of being rebuked for their
acts, have been promoted to the
highest position a lawyer can ever
aspire in the Philippines!
An Average of Five Years a Case
It is not a rare phenomenon to
see in the dockets of our courts ca¬
ses pending for 10 years. In fact,
cases pending for 5 years may be
said to be in the ordinary course of
procedure. The writer of this ar¬
ticle, for instance, has at present
two cases pending in the court of
first instance of Manila. The first
ran in 1928 (D. Hamano, plain¬

In the presence of high government officials, court of first instance judges, prominent lawyers, and members of the fomilies of the judges of the Cou
Triday morning last week. The appellate judges (in black robes) from
Appeals, the presiding judge and seven of the appellate judges tooh their oaths of offi

Their Honors: The Judges of th
Court of Appeals


AST December 12, 1935, or
hardly a month after the
Eestablishment of the Com¬
monwealth, President Quezon in¬
formed the members of the Na-
tional Assembly of the need for
a Court of Appeals. According to
figures, he said, each member of
the Supreme Court had to dispose
and write an opinion, on a yearly
average of one hundred eighty¬
eight cases—an average of one
case for every one and a half
working days. Besides, each Su¬
preme Court member has to study
and take part in the disposition of
from four to five times the above
number.
With the establishment last week
of the Court of Appeals, the Su¬
preme Court was relieved of some
of its heavy duties: plowing
through voluminous cases which


should not be in the Supreme Court
at all.
The members of the new Court
of Appeals, namely, Judge Pedro
Concepcion, chairman; and Appel¬
late Judges Ricardo Paras, Jose
Hontiveros, Francisco Delgado, An¬
tonio Horilleno, Manuel V. Moran,
Domingo Imperial, and Teofilo Si¬
son, were sworn into office Friday

pelate judges, Cesar Bengzon and
Mariano Albert, will take their
oaths of office later. They have to
dispose of pending work in their re¬
spective present offices before tak¬
ing up their new duties as appellate
judges.
As provided by law, the presiding
judge of the Court of Appeals will
preside over the court when it
meets in banc and he will also head
the first of the two divisions of the
court. The second division will be
headed by the senior judge yet to
be determined. Until the seniority,
however, of the members is deter¬
mined, the creation of the divisions
will be delayed, and the court will
have to sit in banc all the time until
the divisions are created.
The induction into office of the
presiding judge and appellate jud¬
ges of the new court was held in
the presence of high government of-
ficials, Manila court of first in¬
stance judges, prominent lawyers,
and members of the families of the
judges of the Court of Appeals. The
ceremony was brief and simple.
All members of the Supreme Court
and the Court of Appeals were in
their imposing black robes. Chief
Justice Avancena administered the
oath. Unlike the induction cere¬
monies of other government offi¬
cials, no speeches were delivered.
The motive behind the creation
of the new Court of Appeals
is little understood, even now, by
many. That motive is revealed in
the message of President Quezon
urging the creation of this court.
He indicated in his message to the
National Assembly of December 12,
1935, that the number of cases ap-¬
pealed to the Supreme Court is not
decreasing but increasing, that “the
volume of work that has had to be
accomplished by the Supreme Court
in order to keep abreast of the ap-


peals from time to
said Court has be
has been unable to o
sary time for a ma¬

That was the general belief


among Malacanang reporters when
they trooped out of the press con-

being assured by President Que¬

But something did happen and
Manuel Roxas is not going to re¬
present the Department of Finance
in the cabinet. Coming as a big
surprise to many, Secretary Anto¬
nio de las Alas of Public Works and
Communications was named Secret¬
ary of Finance in a Malacanang an¬

this week. Sec. Alas’ name was
never mentioned in connection with
the post of Secretary of Finance,
hence the surprise at his transfer

AS there been a decline in
courtesy you ask? I should
AA like to give a qualified ans¬
wer. Courtesy, the dictionary tells
us, is an act of kindness, done in
a polite and graceful manner. The
manner, I must admit, has de¬
clined somewhat in polish and
grace, but the kindness is certain¬
ly still there.
It is very human to deplore things
that have gone never to come back,
and to wish to bring them back. But
then, periods are the same as indi¬
viduals: in both, the virtues are
necessarily accompanied by draw¬
backs. Was there ever a person so
perfect that his virtues did not
sometimes turn against him? The
generous man’s wife quarrels with
him because he has no sense of the
value of money. The tolerant man
loses the crusading spirit; and
champions of lost causes have no
patience with him because he can
not be aroused to indignation over
other people’s heathenish ways. The
lover of humanity necessarily de¬
clines as an ardent nationalist. The
methodical man is a slave to his rou¬
tine. Is there a virtue that does not
sometimes become a defect?
Graceful, ceremonious manners
are the accompaniments of more lei¬
surely living than ours. They were
the ornaments of a slower, less
crowded life. Tennyson, consider¬
ing China and the relatively active
Europe of his day, preferred a few
years of Europe to "a cycle of Ca¬
thay.” He should have remembered
that a cycie of Cathay would have
given him all the time in the world
for endless bowings and other pol¬
ite forms. One day, at a party I saw
a lady and a gentleman, both Jap-
anese taking leave of each other.
They took their time bowing deeply
to each other several times. While
their heads bobbed up and down
quaintly, I watched with delight.
Then some one behind bawled out
“What’s jamming the traffic?”
That is the kind of thing that has
killed the ceremonious manners so
characteristic of well-bred people of
my parents’ day—the busyness of
life as we must live it; the thou¬
sand and one things that must be
crowded into one’s waking hours;
the cry from behind, "kcep mov¬


ing!” “Don’t jam the traffic!” The
rhythm of our lives is different. It
must be allowed to express itself in
something that is not a minuet.
Is it to be deplored? Long ago I
learned--thank heaven—the first
lesson that life inevitably teaches
all who grow up and grow older
that nothing (no circumstance, no
situation, no person) can be one
hundred per cent satisfactory, and
that it is the better part of wisdom
not to deplore what cannot be
helped.
I do think, however, that there is
more genuine kindness and good¬
will in our lives to-day, especially
between the sexes. I ascribe that
to the fact that in demanding equal¬
ity, women have seen the need of
improving themselves, of becoming
stronger and worthier.
You ask if with greater equality
between the sexes there will be an
even greater decline in formal man¬
ners. Possibly. But I think that true
men will always be courteous to
women; for courtesy, at its best, is
the gentleness of the physically
strong toward the physically weak.
A woman is indeed ill-bred if she
does not acknowledge courtesy with
gratitude. No gentleman would for¬
get to say “Thank you” for kindness
shown: the least that a woman can
do is to be a gentleman.

OURTESY is on the wane
here and this is especially
Olamentable when we recall
the past, and remember that the
Filipino is an inherently courteous
individual. Before Spanish cul¬
ture, with the proverbial Latin
gallantry, was introduced into the
Islands, our ancestors had for gen¬
erations and generations taught
their young respect for the aged,
their elders, and the weak.
The recent courtesy drive launched
by the state university may be
taken as a hint that the younger
generation is becoming lax in mat¬
ters of courtesy. It is a fact that
there have been persistent com-
plaints from the weaker sex and
from the older folks to the effect
that the younger ones do not seem
to realize that there are older and
weaker people around them.
In my younger days, for instance,
it was considered almost a sac "ace
to rattle across the floor wh
was sleeping or otherwise
in the house. A child als
his parents’ hands after
gelus or as greeting in
ing. One knocked at the
politely asked to be pe
and never entered ano
without first indicati


sence by saying "tao po," "good
day" or “good evening" as the case
may be.
The desire, it seems, of many
young people to appear "smart”
has wrecked many a beautiful
mark of breeding. Nowadays it
is not uncommon to see people
talking noisily or guffawing among
themselves, when they should be
listening to what others are say-
ing or at least politely remain sil¬
ent. During a certain convention
in which I was present, I observed
that two university professors were
apparently swapping gags, when


they should be listening to the
speech of an invited speaker. This
is not implying that all university
professors are wanting in civility.
The incident is mentioned here on¬
ly to show that one cannot expect
young people to behave when many
of those who are supposed to be
their examples do not.
Many complaints anent courtesy
-the lack of it, rather—come from
the weaker sex. Whether the
weaker sex expects altogether too
much from men in matters of civil¬
ity, I cannot say. But giving one’s
seat to a lady in the street car or


the bus or the theater is not a sac-
rifice to grumble at. Or tipping
one’s hat to a lady acquaintance.
These are little niceties that make
life more livable. Was it not
Wordsworth who said that life con¬
sists in “those little nameless, un¬
remembered acts, of kindness and
of love?”
I am of the belief, however, that
an act of courtesy is not a one-way
affair. Ladies cannot expect at¬
tention and consideration from men
if they (the women) are unrespon¬
sive to these little favors. In other

Women Are Not
So Helpless
They Have An Array Of
Legal Provisions For Their
Protection

tolerate the lewd remarks and in¬
decent behaviour of a hoodlum by
her side. All she has to do is call
the theatre manager and have the
young scalawag arrested for an¬
noying her.
If a young woman cannot leave
her house because a jilted or dis¬
favored Romeo has been keeping
vigil, for four hours, waiting for
her to come down, she only has to
phone for the patrol wagon and
point to the pesky Romeo as a sus¬
picious character loitering in her
premises.
When Not To Abandon Her
Of all students, the smart law
boy is the greatest of heart steal¬
ers. But there is a sure, swift re¬


medy for his kind. A demure co-ed
or any girl left by him to her own
fate, can—between the time he re¬
views for the bar examinations and
he takes his oath as a full-fledged
lawyer—write a letter to the sup¬
reme court, revealing the wrong
done to her. That will mean apo¬
logy in the form of marriage or a
law career forever lost to him.
On Conjugal Partnership
On the question of conjugal pro¬
perty, the wife is far from being
unprotected. When two parties
marry, the law on persons and fa¬
mily relations confers on them an
unwritten partnership: the so-called
conjugal partnership. Roughly, this
means earnings of the husband, or


A woman has only to avail herself of the
protection the law offers to real ze that she
is not as helpless as she believes,


Y OWADAYS designing young
men, gold digging bachelors
11of leisure, not to forget im¬
pecunious widowers, under the
guise of love and marriage, usual¬
ly perpetrate all kinds of decep¬
tions on women. The hearts of
young women are toyed with; and.
very often, rich albeit aged
spinsters and widows are among
the victims.
Naturally, because of such oc-
currences, women have come to
believe they are in matters con¬
cerning honor and material in¬
terests, fully unprotected. They
think that duties and obligations,
not rights and privi'eges, are only
what the law has conferred on
them.
Amply Protected
They are, however, mistaken. The
law has invented or provided women
with a variety of weapons with
which to protect their persons and
material possessions. For every
fa’se move on a man’s part the law
steps in and in effect says, "You
can’t do that.” Only women, for
pure lack of interest or through ig-
norance perhaps, do not avail
themselves of the protection the law
conveniently offers.
There is no reason, for example,
why the movie-going co-ed should

Helpless? Nat so, for the law provides
ample protection for a woman.


both, not to mention real property
earned during marriage do not be¬
long to the husband alone. The
wife has a half interest on them.
So, upon the dissolution of the mar¬
riage or upon her husband’s death.
she gets one half of the whole con¬
jugal property acquired during the
marriage.
More interesting still: A man
tells a girl from the south, he is a
bachelor and succeeds in leading her
to the altar. They live together;
and, most likely, children are born
to them. Then it develops that a
deception has been perpetrated on
her because he has already been
previously married to a girl from
up north. Now, must she simply
weep her heart out, pack her bags,
and trundle her children to her
mother’s home? Will she call her-
se’f an illegal wife and allow the
other woman to get all the benefits
and rights?
Marriage Is Legal
Assuredly not, if she wants to
know. For her protection, she be¬
ing an innocent party, she is con¬
sidered a lawful wife and her off-
spring, legitimate children. Such
status entitles her and her children
to one-half of her husband’s pro¬
perty upon distribution of his estate
(Lao v. Dee Tim, 45 Phil. 739).
Even if both marriages, or the lat-
ter alone is invalidated, the civil
effects are still the same as men¬
tioned above (Sy Joc Lieng v. Sy
Quia, 16 Phil. 137; U.S. v. Mata, 18
Phil. 490).
Against Cruelty
Some married women, even if they
are harshly treated or made to do,
by their husbands, things offen¬
sive to morality or to their feel¬
ings, heroically remain with their
husbands, bearing all sufferings
patiently thinking there is no way


out of their dilemma. For such
shameful actuations by the hus¬
band, a wife can refuse to live in
the conjugal home (Goitia v. Cam-
pos Rueda, 35 Phil. 252). And the
courts cannot compel her to live
with him again. To do so would
make the court an accomplice to
the husband.
Again, if a wife is forced to live
apart from her husband, because of
his own misdoings, she may sue for
separate maintenance. She can
also recover attorney’s fees and
other expenses necessary to en¬
force her rights (Arroyo v. Vas¬
quez, 42 Phil. 56).
Let us turn to criminal law for
a change. There are husbands who
are, by nature, jealous. And things
go from bad to worse if a husband’s
wife is not bad to look at. He locks
his wife up in her room for say, 20
days, not allowing her to leave the
room or peep through a window.
Must a woman suffer such out¬
rage? Must she still fall on his
neck when he liberates her? We re¬


member, the Revised Penal Code
gives the jealous husband reclusion
temporal for it, meaning from 12
to 20 years imprisonment. But the
act will not be considered illegal
detention if it has been made for
the purpose of protecting her, or
from preventing her from commit¬
ting suicide.
Paraphernal Property Law
About this time, a bright co-ed
might have remembered one of her
rights: Act No. 3922, or the Law
on Paraphernal Property. For¬
merly, without permission of the
husband, or a power of attorney
from him, she cannot acquire pro¬
perty or alienate her own property.
The new paraphernal law changed
all that. She can now mortgage,
lease, sell, encumber, alienate, or in
any other wise dispose of her own
property, without asking for per¬
mission from the husband to do so.
Paraphernal property, by the
way, is the mass of property brought
by the wife with her without turn-


ing it over to the husband—to de¬
fray the expenses of married life.
The husband cannot tamper with
the private property of the wife.
As such it cannot be attached or
made to answer for the debts, gam¬
bling debts or otherwise, incurred
by the husband (Alvaran v. Mar¬
quez, 11 Phil. 263). And, likewise,
he has no authority—although he
can do it if the wife loves him
dearly and consents to it—to sell
property acquired with the money
belonging to his wife (Gefes v. Sal¬
vio, 36 Phil. 221). As further pro¬
tection for the wife, the act of the
husband in mortgaging the para¬
phernal property, without sufficient
authority from the wife, is null
and void (Bian Hin & Co. v. Tam
Bomping, 48 Phil. 523
to the courts.
s
Women are not as
many of them believe. They al-
amply protected and all they have
to do is avail themselves of the
protection provided.

He Lived To Become President


And Has Abdon Poblete, Who Saved Young
Quezon From Drowning, To Thank For It
By AGRIPINO C. MONTES


President Manuel L. Quezon (left) and Abdon Poblete,
the man who saved the President from drowning when
the latter was still a boy. Note the dedication on the
Literally: “To Abdon Poblete—whom I love


1 XCESSIVE gratitude has been
pointed out as President
El quezon's weakness. But
there is one man on whom he can
never shower too much gratitude:
an unknown farmer whose picture
or name has not even once ap¬
peared in any newspaper.
Tries Hard to Repay
Abdon Poblete is the name of
this 65-year-old man to whom Que¬
zon will always be indebted. He
is at present residing in Mauban,
Tayabas, but he was born and he
grew up in Baler, the home town
of President Quezon.
He often visits President Que¬
zon, and when they part, the Pres-
ident presses into his hand money
ranging from thirty to one hundred

Abdon Poblete told the writer.
“And once he begged me to let him
have one of my sons so he could
send him to school, but my wife
did not want to part with any of
our children."
Knows Quezon As a Boy
This man’s sixty-five years rest
lightly on his shoulders. Although
the years have dug furrows in his
face and whitened his hair, he still
has much of the strength he had
when he was younger and he still
goes to church regularly. The
years have not dulled the memory
of that eventful incident in the
bay of Baler wherein he and the
boy who would be President played
important roles. "But would you
like to know something about our
President some years before that


incident?” he inquired.
“That would explain
the thing better and in¬
cidentally would clear
up this oft-mentioned
references to our
President’s lineage.”
The President’s fa¬
ther Don Lucio was a
maestro at the Coman¬
dancia, the old man re¬
lated, and his mother
Dona Maria Molina
was also a teacher.
Both of them had
Don
Spanish blood.
Lucio had a Spanish
father and a Filipino
mother.
“Due to the early
death of his mother,”
the old man said,
"young Manuel had not
the opportunity of
knowing her. He then
lived with his aunt,
one of his father’s sis¬
ters. Later he was sent

One Friday morning one of the
priests in the convent, Father Ve¬
nancio Angolo, invited his fellow


priests for a dip at the Baler bay.
The others declined the invitation,
so Father Angolo asked Sacristan
Abdon Poblete and two convent
helps to join him. “He was espe¬
cially desirous of taking me along,”
Abdon Poblete said, “because he
knew I could swim quite well. Be¬

to spot Father Angolo who did not

For Religiom--But
 Hey WIn Take Casi
Dancing Children Feature
At Cebu Fiesta -- Are Paid
Handsomely For Dance
By RAFAEL A. BAUTISTA


YEHE dancing devotees of the
good Virgin of Ubando, Bu¬
 lacan, have nothing on the
sinulog dancers performing before
the miraculous black Senor Santo
Nino and the Lady of Guadalupe
during their annual fiestas in Ce¬
bu city. And no fiesta of the
Senor or the Virgin of Guadalupe,
whose celebration is only a month
away from each other, is consi¬
dered complete without the sinulog
dancers, small boys dressed like
toy soldiers with wooden swords
and shields.
They dance frenziedly, shouting
"Pit Senor!” when showing their
wares before the Holy Child, to the
amusement of the crowd. The dan-
cers, in pairs, number as many as
fourteen. They appear to be fight-
ing and fencing, while accompanied
by the monotonous tom-tom of
drums. They are so serious in
their sham combat that, after the
whole show is over, the dancers are
all in.
This queer manifestation of de¬
votion to the Holy Child and the
miraculous Lady of Guadalupe of
Cebu is the striking feature of the
annual fiestas of these two patron
saints. These sinulog dancers come
in groups from different districts
of Cebu city. Other dancers come


The image of the Holy Child of Cehu,
betore which devotees dance the sinulog.


These young sinulog dancers perform in hanor of their patron saints di
fiestas, but they also accept money for the entertainment they furnish.


from near-by towns purposely com¬
ing not so much to fulfill some reli¬
gious panaad or promise, but to
earn some money for their perfor¬
mance. For the sinulog performers
are paid handsomely for every
dance they make before the honored
images.
The dancers who come from the


barrio of Guadalupe are the most
popular and they are hired by weal¬
thy people to dance in their stead.
Others invite them to dance in
front of their houses for the amuse¬
ment of their small children who


usually enjoy the show.
There are non-professional sinu¬
log dancers, too. They are men
and women who dance before the
Senor or the Good Lady to fulfill

Why Shouldn't I Kill Myself?
Or My Doctor Do The Killing For Me When It
Is Necessary And I Wish It?
By RICARDO MA. ISIDRO


Aa9 a 9
In a previous issue of   (Jan. 30th), a doctor
attacked euthanasia and a university sociology professor de¬
fended it, if cautiously. Because of the professions of both
men, the discussion was considerably scientific, in the
sense that both are well qualified, in view of their profes¬
sions, to speak on the subject from their respective angles.
But what des the layrpan feel about euthanasia? This
is important because, after all, it is his kind, because his kind
predominates in society, who will bear the burden or enjoy
the blessings of euthanasia. On this page is an article in
favor of euthanasia and on the next page one against, both
written by laymen.

YNHE claim by the many who
have expressed their opinions
Aagainst euthanasia that we
cannot take away life because we
do not create life is, I think, more
a defense of fear than an argu¬
ment against the administering
of painless death. It is a conve¬
nient excuse, this claim that we
cannot take away life because we
do not create it. For if euthana¬
sia were universally accepted and
I, say, refused to take away my
life in spite of general agreement
that it would be better for me to
die: I would never recover from
my illness, I was suffering from
intolerable pain, my family was
in want and would suffer un¬
necessarily if I lived longer, I
should then, by general agree¬
ment, be a coward. But as things
stand, with euthanasia condemned,
I can refuse to die. I have no
right to do as I wish with my life.
I did not create it. I can go on
being a burden to my family and
escape being called a coward.
I have a right to do what I wish
with my own life and this right is
modified only by the requirement
that in the exercise of that right I
do not in any way cause injury to
anyone. And where in the exercise
of that right I do not cause injury
to others and at the same time do
someone some service, society ought
to thank me.
The strange thing about the op-
position to euthanasia is the incon¬
sistency of those who voice this op-
position. They are against eutha¬
nasia. And yet they are the very
first to acclaim gestures of self-sa¬
crifice and displays of heroism and
courage.
Not so long ago Manila newspa¬
pers carried a news item about an
old man who attempted to commit
suicide. The old man explained that
he wanted to die as he was too much
of a burden to his family: he
slashed his throat so he could die
and relieve his family of the bur-
den. He was seriously ill and did
not hope to recover, anyway.
Many of those who noticed the
news probably imagined, as I did,
an old, sick man entirely dependent
upon the members of his family for
support. There was in all proba¬
bility want in this family. The old
man could no longer endure the
sight of want made worse by his
unusual demands on the slender
resources of his family. So, he de¬
cided to die. I have my doubts if
the majority of those who learned
of this attempted suicide voiced any
protest against the action of the old
man.
One of the most heroic tales of


the sea concerns one of the passen¬
gers aboard the Lusitania when this
ship was torpedoed and sunk by a
submarine in the Atlantic. In the
general scramble for life-belts a
woman-passenger failed to get one
for herself. A man who was about
to jump overboard with a life-belt
saw the helpless woman. The man

You will not perhaps appreciate
my philosophy of life until I tell
you my own story. Three years ago
I was pronounced by physicians as
an invalid in one of the country’s
infirmaries. I had a kind of gas¬
tric trouble, because of which, I was
forced to see the school physician.
The school physician sent me to an
anti-T. B. center for fluoroscopy.
The result I did not know, but at
least I could guess when I was sent
out for a vacation. I took my va¬
cation and came back to school af¬
ter the end of a semester. Since


then, I had been repeatedly refused
admittance into school, and never
succeeded getting admitted until I
made special arrangements with my
professors one and a half years lat¬
er. Every time I was ejected from
school I was told that I was a sick
man. What was worse, I was told
that I would die after
But every time I was tolo anat

No Favorites
D RESIDENT Quezon's deter¬

A
public know that the govern¬

another expression last week,
when he said okay to Secretary
of Finance Quirino’s ordering
the termination of the contract
of the Manila Harbor Board
with the Manila Terminal Com¬
pany to operate the arrastre
(hauling) service at the gov-
ernment piers of the city when
the agreement expires next
Pr ev i¬
ous to the
Pr esi¬
dent’s say¬
ing the last
word on the
m a tt er,
there had
been a dis¬
cussion as to
Sec. Quiriro
whether the
Department of Finance has the
power to terminate the contract.
“It is wrong for the govern¬
ment to renew contracts without
submitting them again to public
bid,” said the President. “It gives
occasion for the charge, how¬
ever unfounded, that the govern¬
ment is playing favorites or that
the officials concerned are being
influenced by considerations
other than those of public in¬
terest.”

reported that Sec. Yulo sustained

Haussermann Visits Isabela Central

— y SED to seeing gold
picked directly
O from the earth,
Judge John W. Hausser¬
mann, gold magnate of
Luzon and one of the
richest men in the Is-
lands, must have won¬
dered at the complicated
way with which the Isa-
bela Sugar Company of
N eg ros Occidental
transformed "waste pro¬
ducts” in its factory in¬
to "gold."
Judge Haussermann
was accompanied by
Speaker Montilla of the
National Assembly and
General Manager Enri¬
que J. C. Montilla when
he recently visited the
subsidiary products department of
the company last January 28th.
What impressed him most was
the bottle factory of the division
where frascos were being neatly
turned out by about half a dozen
expert blowers. It was explained
to him that the bottles will be used
as containers for the liquors the
company has lately been manufac¬
turing.
The company will probably take
advantage of the recent finding of
the bureau of science: using bag¬
asse ash for the manufacture of
bottles. The problem of disposing
of the crushed sugar cane stalks
was practically solved when these
were dried and used for fuel. But
the problem of dumping away the
ash arose. The manufacture of
bottles out of the bagasse ash will
turn a messy waste product into
useful articles.
The various activities of the Isa¬
bela Sugar Company, which by the
way is claimed to be “the most
highly industrialized central in the
Philippines,” are calculated to make
up for the effects of the sugar lim¬
itation.
For instance, the company turned
to the manufacture of alcohol as a
sideline when the production of
sugar was curtailed.
To create
more demand for the product, the
company thought of turning out
appliances which would use alco¬
hol; hence the alcohol stoves man¬
ufactured by the company.
Speaker Montilla explained that
this subsidiary product of the com¬
pany has given employment to many
men who would otherwise be idle,
besides making the country con¬
scious of the fact that alcohol can
serve the purpose of gasoline, crude
oil, and kerosene.

words, the reaction of the men de-
pends upon the behaviour of the
ladies. If a girl thinks she is the
center of the universe, she should
not be surprised if young men
snub her.
Many men have learned to put
on a thick armor of unconcern when
they see women standing in a
crowded street car or theater be¬
cause of repeated rebuffs. If a
girl accepts a seat from a young
man, she should smile or at least
show her appreciation with a nod
if she cannot say “thanks” or words
of similar import. In the last ana¬
lysis, the rude I-take-it-for-granted
acceptance of a favor on the part
of a girl is as wide a breach of
courtesy as a man’s not offering
his seat to her.
Once when President Lincoln was
walking with a senator on Pennsyl¬
vania Avenue, a Negro whom they
met, greeted the President by tip-
ping off his hat. Lincoln bowed
in response. The senator asked
Lincoln why he saluted a Negro,
and Lincoln answered: “I do not
want a Negro to say that he is


more courteous than the President
of the United States.”
The failure of most of our young
men to observe courtesy is not with-
out cause. In my contact with
young people, they complain that
men of high standing hardly ob¬
serve courtesy, themselves. They
say that it is useless to tip the hat
to the higher-ups for they invari¬
ably ignore the greeting. Why
bother to be respectful?—they
argue. Here, then is food for
thought.
The beautiful Filipino tradition
of using po (or any of its equival¬
ents) in conversations with elders
and parents is passing out. Po
(sir) is an expression of politeness,
respect, reverence, courtesy—the
use of which essentially reflects
refinement and culture.
A great many young people per¬
haps are loathe to use the word be¬
cause they think it denotes accept-
ance of inferiority. Its meaning
should not be interpreted in that
manner for this beautiful word
merely implies respect. Certainly
this is one of the best traditions
we have inherited from our past

N OFT-SPOKEN and unassum¬
ing, yet opium smugglers,
scheming merchants, and oth¬
ers who would evade customs ta¬
riff regulations have learned to re¬
spect him. He has conducted raids
on ships resulting in rich opium
hauls. Even prominent people who
tried to smuggle jewelry into the
country were not spared by him.
This man is Jose B. del Castillo,
recently appointed chief of the
customs secret service, vice Colonel
Jose de los Reyes, now chief of
staff of the Philippine ar¬
my. Middle-aged, slightly
thin, yet there is nothing
of the old man in him; he
moves spryly about.
The public has not read
much about him. But cer¬
tainly it has read newspa¬
per accounts of opium
raids: of quantities of mor¬
phine and cocaine discov¬
ered in unsuspected places
aboard ships and in pas¬
senger baggage. Graphic
tales of jewelry smuggling,
of pier thefts promptly
solved are familiar to news¬
paper readers. Mr. Casti¬
llo, then still assistant chief,
figured prominently in the
planning of these moves to
prevent smugglers from
cheating the government.
Customs secret service
Chief Jose B. del Castillo
was born in the district of
Santa Cruz. Manila, on Ja¬
nuary 16, 1884. His par¬
ents, Jose F. del Castillo
and Isidra Roco, sent him
to the Ateneo de Manila
for his early schooling. He
did not finish any Ateneo
course, however. He want-
ed to be a seaman. So his
parents allowed him to
transfer to the Spanish
Nautical School.
Luck, nevertheless, was
against young Jose. It was
perhaps predestined that he
would never become a ship
officer. For after a stay of
two years, 1897 and 1898, the nau¬
tical school was closed due to the
withdrawal of Spain from the Is¬
lands. So he went home to Ligao,
Albay, where his parents had
moved during the days of the rev-
olution.
In 1899 he returned to Manila,
and his parents did their best to
send him back to the Ateneo. But
he decided to quit school and he
obtained employment in a shipping
house. That was in 1900. A year
later, he obtained a position with
Ker and Company, and finding
him responsible, the firm sent him
to its commercial branch in Cebu.
with a salary of P80 a month.


In 1902 he worked as supercar¬
go, for an inter-insland boat. He al¬
so became a trusted employee in
the shipping and customs divisions
of such well-known firms as the
Tabacalera, Behn Myers and Com¬
pany, Standard Oil Company, and
the Madrigal shipping firm.
On August 7, 1922, Mr. Castillo
first became connected with the
government as supervising secret
service agent, a newly-created posi¬
tion in the secret service division
of the bureau of customs. As su¬


Jose B. del Castillo
Chief, Customs Secret Service
pervising agent, he had to work
hard, at times laboring twenty-four
hours a day.
It was not long, however, before
his zeal for work was recognized.
On July 11, 1924, he was appointed
assistant chief of the division, a
very responsible position.
Together with his men, he
searched all the ships that came in
"It requires perseverance to detect
where prohibited drugs are hid¬
den," he said. "People always find
strange hiding places for them¬
and the men of the division have to
be ingenious too to discover the con¬
traband.
Heavy opium boxes, because
they are easily detected inside the


ship, are usually thrown aboard
with some safety floating device,”
he continued. "An ordinary man
will see only a piece of floating
wood, but an agent always sees a
cord to which are tied boxes con¬
taining tins of opium, morphine
cocaine or other prohibited drugs."
Jewelry, he said, is hard to de¬
tect. Ship arrivals frequently sew
them inside their clothes, or put
them in shoe heels, or inside thick
objects. Lottery tickets, too, are
another kind of contraband that
have frequently fallen into
the hands of customs
sleuths under his division.
Mr. Castillo has gone
abroad once, in 1928, when
he took a vacation of two
months and spent it mostly
in studying customs secret
service work in the ports of
Shanghai and Nagasaki in
Japan.
Of his administration
plans, Mr. Castillo said:
“I’m going to continue the
policies of my predecessors
in office. I’ll also do my
best to improve the ser¬
vice.
Customs sleuthing is kil¬
ling work. An agent does
not usually keep regular
hours, as office workers do.
He is counted upon to re¬
port at any hour of the day
or night to meet an incom-
ing boat and give it a thor¬
ough inspection and search
for contraband goods. But
Chief Castillo has an undi¬
minished love for his work.
“I don’t mind being called
at night,” he said. ""
know that is part of my du¬
ty. It may be raining
hard, the weather stormy,
or the time past midnight,
but when one is called
upon, one is supposed to do
his part.” And Chief Cas¬
tillo, now middle-aged, still
shows the same zeal for his
work which he had shown
when he was still supervising sec¬
ret service agent in 1922.
Chief Castillo shuns publicity.
And, as others observe of him,
“he does not look around much.
but he sees everything.”
Chief Castillo is married to the
former Mercedes Borras of Manila.
Married on March 18, 1912, the
Castillo family is blessed with
three daughters and seven sons, all
studying in the city. Last January
21, 1936, however, the third son of
the family died.
Chief Castillo’s leisure hours, and
here are very few of them, are de-
voted to his hobbies: painting ma¬
ine landscapes and building model
niniature ships and schooners.

SESA



By BENJAMIN E. PANAHON


E HE came to Kaisiwan one
April day. The sun was out
S in the west, beating furiously
on the bare rice fields. It shone
directly into our house I had to
close the window on that side. The
front window was closed, too, but
for a small gap between the shut¬
ters. We had to close the windows
most of the time to keep dust from
getting in. The dust is thick at
home, especially during the dry
season. It is very poor—our street
there. Not a stone on it. During
the rainy months the mud is inor¬
dinately deep, even the carabaos
get stuck in it. Then when the
street dries up in summer and the
rice has been threshed and far¬
mers haul their grains to the ware¬
houses in town or in San Isidro,
cartwheels pulverize the dried mud
into a sea of dust. And the dust:
it gets into the nose, mouth, ears,
into everything.
I was alone in the house. My


parents had sought the cool shade
of the tamarind trees that border
our yard. They were seated in the
two rocking chairs Father had car¬
ried down. That is a habit with
Father and Mother. Mother will
take with her the Liwayway and
read the stories to Father. But not
infrequently Mother finds herself
reading to nobody because Father
usually dozes after Mother starts
reading. Mother has to stop at in¬
tervals and ask Father if he is
following the story. Of course
Father will not admit he has
slept. He will explain he had
just closed his eyes to follow the
narrative better.
I was reclining ungainly on a
wicker chair by the front window
my chin resting on the sill. A ca¬
lesa passed—a cloud of dust trail¬


ing behind. I closed the window
entirely.
I went out to the balcony and
discovered that the calesa had
stopped in front of a neighbor’s
house. I saw a girl, apparently in
her 'teens, leave the vehicle spright
ly. What color! I thought. Her
dress, her vanity case, her hair rib¬
bon, and her shoes—she seemed a
bundle wrapped in red.
Aling Juana had gone down the
house to meet and welcome her vis¬
itors. They were two—the gir
and an elderly woman who, I found
later, was her mother. The girl
flung her arms around Aling
Juana and kissed her. She said she
was very happy to see her Tia
Juana. Trite, I muttered.
I was afraid I would look curious
I retreated to the sala and parted


the shutters a little on that side.
The mother and the daughter had
gone up the house. The girl moved
about the porch, her shoes tap-tap¬
tapping on the wooden floor.
thought of the boys in the high
school who made themselves con¬
spicuous by walking noisily about
in their heavily nailed shoes.
She was looking in my direction
but I knew she could not see me.
I had parted the shutters only a
little. I heard her ask Aling Juana
whose that house was, meaning
ours. Aling Juana pointed to Fa¬
ther under the trees.
“Isn’t it a nice nipa house, Aun¬
tie? Look at those beautiful flow-
ers in their balcony! I want to sit
down by them and smell their fra¬
grance! May I not pluck one of
them to pin on my dress?”
Aling Juana shook her head then
related how Father had taken pains
collecting the different plants—the
milflores, the pitimini, the dahlias,

the rosas de japon, and the begonia
with big leaves—in the balcony and
which Nita, my sister, had assi¬
duously tended.
“And where is Nita now?”
“She has gone to her Ate. She
will probably be coming home soon.”
The girl’s mother and Aling
Juana had entered the living room
and the girl was left on the porch.
There were many things I noticed
in her. Her hair which must have


been recently shortened hung in
curls around her neck. Her eye¬
brows were carefully shaped—two
semi-circles above her eyes. I won¬
dered if they were really that long,
those eyebrows. Plucked and pen¬
ciled, I imagined. And her cheeks:
they were unusually red!
Before supper Aling Juana sent
us a plate of paksiw. They are like
that—the barrio people. When
someone returns from the city or


from a distant town, he has many
things with him as pasalubong and
counted among those to receive
them are the many neighbors and
friends. Thus every time Mother
arrives from Cavite, almost every
family around has its share of ti¬
napa, tuyo, or bread. Or when Cuya
returns from a hunting trip, every
family around shares with the bag.
The next day Sister and the city
girl were acquaintances. Sister


told me her name was Mariquita.
It sounded coquettish, but it fitted
her—the city girl—the boisterous,
modern, flirting city miss that she
was to me. But she preferred to
be called Mariquing! It was very
guttural, noisy, this name Mari¬
quing. It dripped with affectation
—but just like her. Perfect, that
name—for her.
In a week she was the talk of the

Y a strange twist of circum¬
stances—call them coinciden¬
E ces if you will, or by another
name if you can see relentless Pur¬
pose working through all things—I
have lately, and almost simultan¬
eously, come into possession of two
remarkable revelations concerning
the mystery of the Woman in Red
—-the heroine of that most astound¬
ing tragedy of Monte Carlo—and
they supply the threads to lead a
thoughtful mind either to hs cem¬
plete solution ar, periaps, te a still
mistigt labgrinth within the border
land set een riesh and spiin.
My Towud Dawson, going up and
down the earth in search of health,
had been induced to try the healing
summer air of southern Arizona
and thither we went. The day af-
ter our arrival at our destination
it rained, with all the discomfort to
tourists of wetness in a climate
warranted dry. Dawson, in his
querulous, invalid’s humor, railed
at the unpleasant weather as we
paced back and forth on the shel¬
tered veranda of the hotel, his fret-
ful eyes on the muddy street an the
drift of the fine, white rain.
"Always rain, he grumbled,
"rain in London, rain in Paris, rain
on the Rhine, rain in Rome, rain
here, rain everywhere!”
“You forget,” I said, “the Rivie¬
ra."
“Ye-es,” he admitted, "but that
was two winters ago.
A girl passed by on the street
just then, erect and graceful under
her dripping umbrella. A gust of
wind, blowing back the cape from
her shoulders, exposed its scarlet
lining, which made a quick flash of
color in the dull, gray morning.
“Monte Carlo!" exclaimed Daw¬
son, with a sudden, backward leap
of memory.
“Mystery and masks, and the
Scarlet Lady,” I said in return.
It had come back to us both, at
that flash of scarlet and my careless
mention of the Riviera—the awful
tragedy of the Woman in Red and
the mystery surrounding it and
her. We had worn the subject to
threads in talking it over the first
few months after we had left Mon¬
te Carlo, though it was certainly a
fruitful subject:
The strange appearance of the
woman at the gambling resort; her
caprice of color and her invariable
mask; her success at the gambling
table; the sudden disappearance of
her young English lover and the
well-authenticated rumor that he
had lost his reason over the acci¬
dental sight of her face one night
in the Casino gardens; her suicide
immediately after: and, finally, the
madness which had come upon the
priest of Sainte Devote, who had
lifted the mask from her dead face
at her request. But gradually the
mystery had been crowded out of
our minds by the new scenes and
events of our travels and by the


ever-present anxiety for my
friend’s health, so that for over a
year the subject had not been men¬
tioned.
Now, in an instant, the old hor¬
ror and fascination of it was upon
me once more and I saw by the look
in Dawson’s eyes that it was so
with him. I saw again the tall
cliffs of Monaco, with the restless
amethyst sea at their feet; the
slender, curiously graceful figure
in scarlet as it moved before us at
Monte Carlo, in the flower-crowded
streets and in the brilliant salle de
jeu of the Casino, and I saw again
the ugly stain darkening in the sun
on the marble steps.
Without preface, Dawson took up
the subject we had dropped so long
ago.
“Jack, what in creation was be¬
hind that woman’s mask?” he be¬
gan argumentatively and with irri¬
tation.
“My dear Dawson,” I answered
wearily, "how should I know! Per¬
haps something outside the bounds
of creation."
“I am sure she was the Devil!”
he said, after a pause, but without


that emphasis which springs from
conviction.
Then we took up the old theories
about the matter, over which we
had argued so often before. With
a sick man’s nervous fancy, Daw¬
son insisted that a terrible defor¬
mity, or a disfiguring birthmark
or the signs of leprosy, if suddenly
and unexpectedly revealed in the
face of a human being, might, un¬
der certain conditions, cause insan¬
ity. But I, arguing the question
from the standpoint of vigorous
health, was positive that, while
such a revelation would undoubted¬
ly be a shock, it could not, under
any conditions, have so serious an
effect on a sound mind. There were
no special reasons for us to doubt
the mental strength of the Eng¬
lishman or of the priest, two men
who had drifted together into the
tragedy, apparently by the merest
chance. Dawson grew cross over
the puzzle and puffed his cigar vin¬
dictively.
“I wish I could get hold of that
infernal old woman,” he growled.
"I’d get the truth out of her some¬
how."


A man with whom we had formed
a slight acquaintance at the hotel
now joined us and the matter of the
Woman in Red was dropped.
could see, however, by the wrathful
crease in Dawson’s forehead that he
was thinking of it still.
His ill-humor over it lasted all
day, even until the early dusk, and
we went down to dinner. As he was
then still taciturn, I amused myself
by staring covertly at the people
about me. There were the usual
semi-invalids at a health resort and
the usual curious tourists, eager
over everything, from the February
almond blossoms on the tables to
the Arizona olives on the bill of
fare. A little bored by the scene
and not over-pleased with my din¬
ner, I was about to rouse Dawson,
when I noticed at the farther end of
the table opposite us a big, fair
youngish man, haif-hidden from my
view by a huge palm. His face was
turned from me and I caught only
the ruddy outline of its profile,
shaded by abundant, light hair, no¬
ticeably gray. Then he turned and
I saw his face.

TRIUMPH of the PLAIN WOMAN


By DOROTHY BLACK


(6NIVE me a good hard-wearing face—an all-weather face, to
( which Time can do little, should be the prayer of any
woman who has any claim to wisdom at all.
Do not envy the beautiful women, and those of whom it is
said: "Her face is her fortune.” If our face is our fortune—if
it is our only fortune—wnat then? Bankruptey stares at us,
and despair is all the companion we have left.
There is nothing quite as bitter as the lot of a woman who
has been very beautiful, when she is not quite so beautiful any
more. She has grown so used to admiration, to praise, to ap-
plause for her poorest efforts. To the burbling of the press,
the attentions of the photographers.
The plainer woman has immense advantages. She has nev-
er been accepted at face value. She has always had to sing for
her supper, so the probabilities are that she has learnt one or
two really good tunes which will stand her in excellent stead
all her lifetime.
She has not had the same number of enemies, since she
does not arouse the same jealousies. She is not surrounded by
those petty meannesses which must ever be the lot of those who
are raised, be it ever so little, above the general crowd. No
sooner do you stand out from the general crowd in any way
than you become a target for clods.
She has worked for her friendships, and she has done a
bit of chiselling at her own character, chopping away the cor¬
ners. She had to, or she would never have been asked to the
party!
People who love her, love her for herself. They will go on
loving her, because what they love in her is beyond the reach
of time, which wreaks havoc on faces but rather improves souls.
Wrinkles and crow’s feet do not accumulate on character
—on that warm responsiveness that flows from some people,
drawing all others to them, as against that chilly blast, like the
wind over snow mountains, which is the feeling others often
give us.

Facts About the
American Flag
(From FACT DIGESTI


 TO law has ever been passed to
N designate how the stars on
the U. S. flag shall be arranged.
At first they were placed in a
circle, then arranged as a large
star, and, since the number of
states rose to 48, they have been
put in six rows.
* * 
The American flag is the third
oldest of the national standards.
There is only one flag allowed to
fly above the Stars and Stripes. It
is the church pennant.
*
*
It was originally intended that
the United States flag have a star
and a stripe for every State. And
so, when Vermont and Kentucky
were admitted to the Union in 1791
and 1792, both the stars and the
stripes were increased to fifteen.
But shortly, as other States en¬
tered, it was obvious there would
be too many stripes in the emblem,
so a law enacted in 1818 called for
a stripe for each of the thirteen
original colonies and star for every
State.
Regardless of when a new State
is admitted to the Union, the star


for it in the United States flag isn’t
added until the following Fourth of
July.
When the President visits a ves¬
sel of the United States the Pres-
ident’s flag is broken out the mo¬
ment he steps aboard and is kept
flying as long as he is on the ship.

If your American flag is getting
worn and ragged (or you’ve dis¬
covered your Old Glory was man¬
ufactured in Japan) and you want
to destroy it, you might follow the
practice of the United States Gov-

Since the flags on the Capitol fly

StGk THAT COLD!
OLDS are contagious and people justly keep away
from anyone who is continvally sneezing or cough¬

when it is difficult to breathe, put some MENTHOLATUM
in a spoon, hold it over boiling water and inhale its
healing and soothing vapors. They reach the seat of
the trouble and bring welcome ease and relief. A
liberal application of MENTHOLATUM on the chest
and throat will assist early recovery.

YOR deserting a drunken friend,
X Karl Kraemer of Darmstadt,
Germany, was sentenced to three
years in prison. After a drinking
bout of several hours, the friend,
Emil Schnellbacher, offered to
drive Kraemer home. There was an
argument about starting, and
Kraemer left Schnellbacher with
his horse and carriage and went on
his own way home. Later Schnell¬
bacher was found on some isolated
railroad tracks severely injured.
His horse had been killed in his
carriage by
a passing train.
Schnellbacher died later in a hos¬
pital.
The court, in sentencing Krae¬
mer for manslaughter, ruled that it
was his duty to stick to his friend
and see him safely to his home. It
is the first time in the history of
Germany that any one has been
sentenced for such an offense.

one-time obscure Missouri pia¬

A yent to Holiywood as the wife
of a surgeon. While the doctor had
been perfecting his surgical skill in
Vienna, however, his youthful wife
had become impressed with the Aus¬
trian folk-love of music, and deter¬
mined to instill a similar spirit in
the people of America. The burst
of World War patriotism gave her
an opportunity in the “Hollywood
Sing” and the Community Chorus.
Later, when a group of civic-minded
citizens sought someone to aid in
putting to community use a lately
discovered canyon with unusual
acoustic properties, they chose the
little dynamo who had made Holly¬
wood music-conscious. The Bowl
was a test for Artie Carter’s organ¬
izing gifts and a real opportunity
to “democratize” music. In 1921
came her first inspiration, the


Above: a biologist poses with a crow

HEN CHANGED TO ROOSTER
BI BIOLOGISTS
Turning roosters into hens and
vice versa is the newest miracle to
be attempted by science. Working
at the Biological Institute of the
College of France a group of scien¬
tists are engaged in a series of
amazing experiments on the hypo¬
physis gland, a small gland situat¬
ed at the base of the brain.
It is their belief that by trans¬
planting this gland from the body
of a rooster into the body of a hen
a complete change of sex will be ef¬
fected.
In early experiments conductec
on various breeds of poultry, French
biologists have succeeded in proving
their contention.

Easter Sunrise Service, when 30,000
persons lifted their voices in song.
The acoustics were miraculous, and
Mrs. Carter determined never to
rest until a great orchestral season
of summer symphonies should be
inaugurated. In July of 1922, Dr.
Alfred Hertz lifted his baton over
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Or¬
chestra, and sounded the first note
of “Symphonies under the Stars,”
the beginning of a great concert
series which in 14 consecutive sea¬
sons has attained world acclaim for
bringing great music to large mas¬
ses at small cost.
VTRS. Gladys Gage Rogers, after
LVA years of devotion to her own
crippled son, found that it is pos¬
sible to fill a handicapped child’s
life with so many interests and so
much happiness that he shows a
marked physical improvement, even
though his disability is of a perma¬
nent nature. Six years ago she en¬
listed the aid of Miss Leah Thomas
and established a haven where such
children could learn to get the most
out of their handicapped lives. She
found an attractive Green Mountain
farm of 16 acres, named it Robin
Hood’s Barn, and carried the spirit
of the lovable outlaw of Sherwood
Forest into all its activities. The
main building contains the recep¬
tion room, open-air dining room and

the children have constructed castles
and turrets in true medieval style.
In this camp, during July and
August, the children lose the feel¬
ing of inferiority which attends
their associations with normal chil¬
dren, for all are suffering from
some physical handicap which makes
them one. Since each child has his
own counselor, the expense is con¬
siderable, and well-to-do parents are
expected to pay enough to provide
for one child of less fortunate par¬
ents.
T the end of the World War,
ADr. Frank A. Brewster of
Beaver City, Neb., bought an old
army airplane. A month later he
saved the life of an oil worker with
a fractured skull by reaching him in
55 minutes—a three-hour auto¬
mobile trip would have cost the
man’s life. Since then Dr. Brew¬
ster has flown more than a million
miles in looking after the people of
southern Nebraska and northern
Kansas. He operates daily in two
hospitals 150 miles apart. In the
early days, one of his pilots was
killed in a mid-air collision and his

So small that it may readily be
carried in a vest-pocket, a folding
safety razor for travelers has no
conventional handle. Instead, it is
grasped by a pair of hinged tabs
attached to the blade holder. The

blades, may easily be washed and
dried, and has no loose parts that
may be mislaid.

CANNED BLOOD TO SAVE
LFE
Saving life by using “canned
blood” for transfusions is the pro¬
phecy of Dr. David John Davis,
dean of the University of Illinois
Medical School. Dr. Davis states
that in Russia the use of canned
blood has been highly successful for
more than five years and that there
is no reason why it should not
prove equally successful anywhere.
The blood is taken from dead per¬
sons, tested for disease, classified,
and then sealed in sterile contain¬
ers ready for immediate or future
use. Dr. Davis announced that in
preliminary tests made on dogs re¬
sults were more than pleasing.
Until now the saving of a life de-
pended upon a person willing to
give his blood, provided it was the
correct type. Canned blood will
make this unnecessary.

Roads First
The new government should be
congratulated for pushing through
the much delayed road building pro¬
gram for Mindanao which is in line
with the national policy of coloniza¬
tion. This is a much wiser step
than the earlier one of simply send¬
ing colonists to the Mindanao hin¬
terlands where travel is difficult
even to the brave and determined
pioneer.
Once roads have traversed the
rich plains and agricultural public
lands of Mindanao, there shall be
practically no need for the govern¬
ment to coax settlers to come.
Home-seekers, of their own voli¬
tion, will come to populate the re¬
gions traversed by roads. The peo¬
ple’s willingness to come will always
be in direct ratio with the increased
facilities that may be established.
People up north, wishing to set-
tle here, usually ask their friends
from the south: Are there roads?
And the answer, invariably is: No
roads, no post office, no telegraph,
etc., and the prospective settlers
cancel their plans.
We rejoice at the renewed deter¬
mination to populate Mindanao.
But the immediate need is roads
and more roads. And we ask: how
long shall we be made to wait still?

they make the unemployment prob¬

of solution. We doubt if, with the
flow of unemployment unstemmed,
the government can fully cope with
the situation during the transition
period.
The government, however, can
partly solve this if these young men
are sent to Mindanao and given in¬
dividual parcels of land for cultiva¬
tion. Our “Promised Land" offers
a vast field for opportunities. And

A Note From The Pipes
AN, blow your pipes and I will be

I heard you play, caught your swift eye,
“A pretty melody!” called I,
"Hail, Pan!"—and sought to pass you by.
Now blow your pipes and I will sing
To your sure lips’ accompanying!
Wild god, who lifted me from earth,
Who taught me freedom, wisdom, mirth,
Immortalized my body’s worth,
Blow, blow your pipes! And from afar
I’ll come—I’ll be your bird, your star,
Your wood, your nymph, your kiss, your rhyme,
And all your godlike summer-time!

Commonwealth enjoying the luxu¬
ries of rich people, why can’t they
make monetary sacrifices? It will
be already “cruelty to animals” to
reduce the starvation wages of gov¬
ernment clerks and other low-sala¬
ried employees.
2. Taxing pleasure-going peo¬
ple. Why not tax social pleasures,
say a one-centavo tax for every
person entering a movie show?
3. Taxing professional, business
and employed women. A yearly
tax, especially from women engaged
in business, will not hurt their
pockets; and the amount thus col¬
lected from them will go a long way
towards financing our national de¬
fense program.
It is to be deplored that our high-
salaried government officials are
not taking the lead in voluntarily
reducing their salaries.
Take the case of the assembly-
man who works only 100 days. With
the amount they are getting now,
as provided by the Constitution and
the National Assembly act they
passed increasing their appropria¬
tions for personnel and stationery,
they actually receive P54 a day—a
sum which is the average monthly
salary of an ordinary teacher who
works night and day, and who fre-
quently has to give contributions
for the entertainment of big "fish-
es” in the government.
The burden of national defense
should be borne by all proportion¬
ately. The undersigned, who re-
ceives enly P100.00 as supervising
teacher, will unhesitatingly give up
one third of his salary if the highly-
paid government officials will do
the same.

Every Housewife Should
Know How To Render
FIRST
AAM
By Dr. Isabel Ferrer
Chief, Health Section, Home Economics Di¬
vision, Bureau of Science


IRST aid treatment is an immediate and
temporary help given to ease the suffer¬
Ming or to save the life of a person after
an accident or at the onset of a sudden illness.
The treatment is given before the services of
a physician is obtained, for in accidents the
time factor counts very much. Minor ailments
like small cuts, bruises, sprains, fainting, in¬
sect bites, and the like need prompt and proper
attention as much as the more serious ail¬
ments. What to do, what not to do, and an
alert but sure action are the essential require¬
ments in rendering first aid treatment.
For the housewife, a skillful knowledge of
first aid means saving of money, suffering,
and even life. Falls, cuts, bruises, burns, faint¬
ing, and dog bites are common household acci¬
dents, and the housewife who does not know
what to do may just cry, or shout to call for
help, or follow blindly the unwarranted advice
of well-meaning friends.
What To Do in Cut Wounds
When small and caused by clean instru¬
ments like table or paring knives, a sewing nee¬
dle, or a broken glass, the best thing to do is
to press and let the wound bleed. Dry and
paint the wound with a 2% solution of mer¬
curochrome or with tincture of iodine. Cover
the wound with sterile gauze and keep the gauze
in place by a bandage or adhesive tape. When
the wound is large and bleeds profusely, check
the bleeding by applying pressure with the
hand or with a tourniquet. When the wound
is dirty, as those caused by rusty nails, the
wheels of a vehicle, tin cans, etc., washing with
warm boiled water or with 206 Dakin’s solu¬
tion is necessary to remove the dirt. Deep,
punctured wounds should be opened with a ste¬
rile knife to allow cleaning and application of
disinfectants. After washing, dry the wound
with sterile absorbent cotton and paint with
2% mercurochrome or dilute tincture of iodine.
Cover with sterile gauze. A prophylactic in¬
jection of anti-tetanic serum is necessary for
dirty wounds.
Burns
When a burn causes reddening only of
small part of the skin, little or no treatmen 
necessary. Pain may be alleviated by tr.


plication of coconut oil or ink.
When there are blisters, puncture with a
flamed pin and remove the fluid. Keep the part
clean and protect it from infection by the ap-
plication of 29% mercurochrome and a clean
dressing.
When part of the skin is peeled off and a
small area is involved, the same treatment as
the preceding should be followed.
When a burn is extensive as that caused
by explosions, boiling water, acids, and elec¬
tricity, the life of a person is in danger and
the service of a physician is indispensable.
While somebody calls for a doctor, some one
may help the patient ease his pain and perhaps
tide him over the danger of death.


First aid treatment for bleeding nose.


The injured person, if weak and uncon¬
scious, should be brought gently to a warm,
dark room and made to lie down with the head
lower than the rest of the body. Let him smell
spirit of ammonia or ether, and when he stirs,
give him hot and strong coffee or tea. Remove
the clothes and put screens around him for pri¬
vacy and to avoid unnecessary pain caused by
drafts of air. The rest of the treatment should
be left to the physician.
Sprains and Strains
Sprain is a temporary dislocation of a bone
from its joint caused by slipping or by falls.
Strain is undue stretching of a muscle or ten¬
don caused by forceful exertion and falls. In
both cases there is pain, and to alleviate this
apply ice or running water, and keep the in-
jured part at rest.
Broken Bones
In falls or run-over accidents, whether
there is distinct evidence or not of a broken
bone, extreme care is necessary in handling the
person. Hasty and improper action may add
more injury. After the accident, examine care¬
fully which part of the body is injured. Give
smelling salts and prepare the patient for
transportation to a near-by hospital or clinic.
If the bone of the arm is broken, provision
" ald be made to prevent displacement of the
roken parts by the use of splints. Keep the
affected arm close to the chest, if possible, and
on the outer side of the arm apply a sufficient


padding of soft cloth and a wooden splint ex¬
tending from the shoulder to the middle of the
forearm. Keep the splint in place by tying it
to the chest. Carry the patient with the least
possible movement on his part and take him to
a hospital for treatment.
Nose Bleeding
Common nose bleeding subsides even with-
out aid, but when profuse or when it happens
frequently in a person, medical care is imper¬
ative. As a first remedy, let the patient assume
a sitting position, with the head bent backwards
or rested on the back of a chair. Apply cold
water on the face and neck. If this is not
enough, plug the nose with sterile cotton lub¬
ricated with sterile vaseline. Consult a physi¬
cian for possible nose trouble or a general dis¬
ease.


Insects in the Ear
This is very painful. Drown the insects
by dropping warm coconut oil into the ear. Dry
with cotton tipped applicators.
Seeds in the Ear or Nose
Do not wet the seeds for moisture causes
the seeds to swell and makes removal difficult.
Gently remove with forceps. If unsuccessful,
seek the aid of a physician, to avoid giving more
injury and making the condition worse. Foreign
bodies in the ear should never be pushed fur¬
ther inwards.
Foreign Bodies in the Eyes
Do no rub nor blow into the eyes. Small
particles of dust may be washed out with tears
without assistance. If necessary, remove with a
soft, clean handkerchief. If itchy or painful,
wash the eyes with warm 2%% boric acid solu¬
tion.
Fainting
In this case, there is temporary loss of con¬
sciousness and marked pallor on the face. Avoid
or break apart curious crowds of people to give


What ta do when an insect gets into the ear

her students in home economics to
use inexpensive Filipino dishes in
planning well-balanced menus. The
money spent for the materials used
for this menu was noted down by
the girls who made the purchases
and it amounted to a little over one
peso. This amount may be less,
censidering the fact that guavas

—IVEN the loveliest lady, the
ybeauty editor of Vogue says,
ifher finger nails are dirty,
if her hands are ugly-looking,
everything about her is ruined.
They stand out too literally like
sore thumbs, and what can she
do a bout them? In case of
emergency, a woman can touch
up her face with powder and
rouge, her lips with lipstick, run
a comb through her hair or cover
it with a hat, but when her hands
are unkempt or badly groomed,
there is nothing she can do about
them except to sit on them or
keep them folded in her lap, but
not for long.
It does not make much difference
to-day what size or shape your
hands or fingers are. It is the way
we take care of them that counts.
To-day’s beauty is a self-made
beauty, and to-day’s lovely hands
ave tha well-cared for hands. The


clean, smoothi, anu sor.
part of the body gives away the
woman’s age or grooming habits
more than her hands.
The next time you look into your
mirror, Max Factor says, hold your
hands up to your face, palms to¬
ward the mirror. Are they red
and wrinkled? Turn them around.
Are the backs rough and discol¬
ored? There is no reason why your
hands should not be the same color
as your face. And no reason why
they should not be as soft and
smooth. Here’s how to do it, ac¬
cording to Max Factor:
Simply keep a bottle of hand
lotion on your dressing table.
Whenever your hands come in con¬
tact with water, pour a few drops
of hand lotion into your palm and
massage it well into the skin. You
will find that your hands become
lighter in color, softer, and love¬
lier.
Instead of detracting from your
charm, your hands should increase
your loveliness.
The second step in hand groom¬
ing is a thorough, weekly manicure.
With so many preparations and
equipment for manicuring now on
the market, there is no reason why
you should not be able to give your¬
self a, good manicure as a profes¬
sional can.
To many women, a manicure
means simply shaping the nails to
the desired length and applying a
coat of nail polish on each nail.
The complete manicure consists of

three steps: shaping the nails,
softening and pushing back the
cuticle, and polishing the nails.
The Perfect Manicure
Have all the things for your
manicure ready before you begin.
These should include a bowl of
soapy water and a towel.
First, remove any remaining pol¬
ish with a small piece of cotton
moistened with the polish remover.
There is now on the market a nail
polish remover that contains oil to
prevent the drying out of the nails.
Then file each nail to a becoming


Every Week


stick, dip this end into the cuticle
remover, then work with this gently
around each nail, pushing back the
cuticle. It may be necessary to use
the cuticle scraper to remove the
dead skin which clings to the nails
or to cut away ragged edges with
the small scissors. Pass the orange
stick under the tip of each nail to
loosen up dirt and stain. Then,
with dry cotton on the orange
stick, work under each nail to re¬
move the loosened particles of dirt.
Next, rinse the hands in clear wa¬
ter. Wipe dry with a towel, gently
pushing back the cuticle and wip¬

shape. The best shape of the nail
conforms with the contour of the
finger tip and the best length does
not exceed the finger tip. Ex¬
tremely long or pointed nails are
considered bad taste. Use the
steel nail file for shaping the nails,
filing each nail from the corners to
the top with short, quick strokes.
Smooth the edges of the nails with
an emery board, using the coarse
side first, and then the fine side
Then soak the finger tips in warm
water to soften the cuticle. Wipe
the fingers dry. Wrap a bit of cot¬
ton around the tip of an orange


ing away the loosened, dead cuti¬
cle.
The nails are now ready for the
polish. Be sure that all the old
polish has been removed, that the
nails are absolutely clean, dry, and
free from oil or grease before apply¬
ing the polish, otherwise it will not
adhere properly. To be safe, wipe
the nails with a bit of cotton moist-
ened with nail polish remover.
The nail polish should be applied
carefully and uniformly. Take a
small amount of the liquid on the
brush and apply from the half moon
toward the finger tip. If the ap-


pearance of the polish is unsatis¬
factory, remove it completely with
polish remover before applying a
new coat. Many prefer to apply
two coats of nail polish to make it
more lasting.
The manicure may be finished
with the application of cuticle oil or
pomade.
In the rush of present-day act¬
ivities, many women find it diffi¬
cult to keep the nail tips clean and
smart looking at all times. How¬
ever, if they are cleansed once a day
in the manner described above, that
is, passing the orange stick with a
bit of cotton moistened in cuticle
remover wrapped around it, they
will find it easier to keep the nail
tips clean and fresh-looking. By
using nail white under each nail
tips much dirt may be prevented
from getting under it. Never use
a sharp-pointed instrument for
cleaning the nails, for this scratches
the under part of the nail tips and
makes removing the dirt more dif-
ficult.
If the nails are brittle or very
-sily or if they


par or yos¬
Correct this cause Iirst.
every night, soak the finger tips
in warm olive oil and massage the
nail bed of each finger with the
olive oil. Keep the nails short and
avoid injuring them.
It is easy to keep the hands well¬
groomed between the weekly mani¬
cures. Each night, scrub the nails
with a stiff nail brush and wash
the hands thoroughly with a mild
soap. Then wipe your hands com-
pletely dry with a soft towel. Be¬
fore going to bed, use the hand lo¬
tion. In the morning, file the
corners of each nail to keep it well¬
shaped. Clean the under part of
each finger tip with the cuticle re-
mover, as described. Apply nail
white, if desired. Every time you
wipe your hand dry, push back the
cuticle, very gently, with the to¬
wel.
Up To Your Elbows
Whatever you do to your hands,
you should also do to your arms and
especially to the elbows. The lo¬
tion after washing, the cream at
night, and the finishing prepara¬
tion when you go out during th
day—all should reach up to the el
bows. It will be a good practic
to scrub your elbows with a stifi
brush and soap every time yor
wash your hands. ,

The Return Of
BEEGAOS
In Women's Gowns


yE don't remember now
/ where we read an article
yich aimed to showy that
fashions in women’s clothes fol¬
low, or are indicative of, the fi¬
nancial condition that prevails
over the civilized world. Thus,
during the world war when every¬
thing was scarce and dear, the
short tight dresses that did not re-
quire more than three yards of
fabric came into fashion. This
same article told how textile
manufacturers found a way of
disposing of their fabrics quick-
ly. They called leading designers
and had a conference with them.
Result: the introduction of long,
full-skirted dresses. Came the de¬
pression, so cottons became the
yogue.
These stories about the origin of
fashions in women’s dresses may
not be true, but they are interest¬
ing and credible. The return of
elegance, of rich fabrics, in wom¬
en’s clothes is being taken by ob¬
servers of fashions as an indication
that the depression is nearly, if not
entirely, over. Women are again
dressing in true gala style for for¬
mal evening social functions, and
what is more, they also insist that
men do the same.
The inauguration of the Com-
monwealth seems to have been res¬
ponsible for the return of elegance
in women’s gowns here in Manila.
We learned from leading modiste
shops in the city that the most
elegant and expensive ternos they


ful .—— and safely protected


in every kind of weather.
For the face, neck, arms,
and the hands. Protects,
Softens, and Beautifies.


THE IDEAL BABE FOR FACE POWDER, TOS!


Mrs. Agustin Liboro, ane of Manila's
best dressed matrons, wears this terno,
the skirt of which is made of chiffon
velvet. The tapiz-train is plain chiffon,
embroidered with sequins around the
edge.
have made in years were ordered
for the different social functions
that were scheduled to take place
during the inauguration week, Our
women "socialites” forgot the Nepa
this time and went in strongly for
imported and expensive fabrics.
Then, too, jewelry (not costume
jewelry, with synthetic stones, but
earrings, pendants, brooches, rings,
and bracelets with real diamonds,
pearls, and precious stones) also
made its reappearance at the state
functions, but most notably at the
reception and ball that was given
by President and Mrs. Quezon at
Malacanang as a despedida for the
visiting U. S. congressmen. This
affair was voted the most brilliant
of all social functions held during
the inaugural week.
A well-known dry goods store on
the Escolta that is patronized by the
elite of Manila society revealed
that fabrics that are rich not only
in texture but also in colors are now
the most favored for European as
well as for Filipino evening gowns.
These are the chiffons, plain and
flowered, lace shot with metal
threads, lame in silver and gold
brocades, taffeta, moire, and velvet.
These fabrics range in cost from
five pesos to as high as fifteen
pesos a meter. It is not surpris¬
ing for a woman to spend as much
as seventy pesos for the material of
a gown alone. Here is an exam¬
ple: In a fashion show staged by
society girls in Manila for the Fox


Movietone and Paramount News
cameramen who were here for the
inaugural, one of the models wore
a terno made with ten meters of
lace costing twenty pesos a meter
It is no secret that the skirt alone
that Miss Conchita Sunico, Manila
carnival queen last year, wore for
her coronation cost two hundred
pesos. It was made of chiffon
completely covered with sequins.
The sequins and the labor made it
very expensive.
At the last reception and ball
given by the Rho Alpha, most of
the girls wore velvet, with dark


This terno worn by Lucy Pamintuan
and made by Jardin de Madas utilized
ten meters of a very expensive, cobweb¬
by lace and scores of hand-painted, vel¬
vet archid flowers.


colors predominating. The new
elegance in women’s evening clothes
was graphically shown in this af¬
fair. The girls wore real evening
gowns on this gala occasion.
Because the fabrics mentioned
above are very rich, they do not re¬
quire any trimming at all, but they
call for the use of equally rich ac¬
cesories in the form of elaborately
jeweled dress clips or brooches, belt
buckles, hair ornaments, earrings
and bracelets, not to mention even¬
ing bags with jeweled clasps.
In the evening, one must sparkle
from head to foot, as in the old days
when women wore jeweled pen¬
tuches in their hair and rhinestone


buckles on their shoes. What you
wear in your hair or on top of your
head does not matter; it may be a
tiara, a pair of clips, an aigrette,
a cluster of artificial or real flow¬
ers, or a string of pearls inter¬
woven in your hair. The more
sparkle it gives, the better. Then,
too, no neckline nowadays seems to
be complete without at least one
dress clip. Rhinestone dress clips
are very effective on dark-colored
velvets. Shoes are made to order
to match the dress or have rhine¬
stone buckles or heels. A very sell¬
able item in a jewelry store on the
Escolta is a convertible brooch that
may be separated into four pieces
to make a pair of ear clips and a
pair of dress clips.
Dona Pacita Longos, dean of
Manila modistes, confirmed this re¬
turn of elegance in women’s clothes.
Dona Pacita has been making ter¬
nos for the smartest women of the
Philippines for over a decade now
and she has followed the changes
that have occurred in local fash-
ions. Before the depression, she
said, a terno costing fifty pesos
was only for shopping. With the
coming of the depression, women
ordered not only fewer gowns but
also less expensive ones. She is

clasps.

monwealth seems to have been res¬
ponsible for the return of elegance
in women’s gowns here in Manila.
We learned from leading modiste
shops in the city that the most
elegant and expensive ternos they

The Return Of
LEKAOM
In Women's Gowns


Mrs. Agustin Liboro, ene of Manilo's
best dressed matrons, wears this terno,
the skirt of which is made of chiffon
velvet. The tapiz-train is plain chiffon,
embroidered with sequins araund the
edge
have made in years were ordered
for the different social functions
that were scheduled to take place
during the inauguration week. Our
women "socialites” forgot the Nepa
this time and went in strongly for
imported and expensive fabrics.
Then, too, jewelry (not costume
jewelry, with synthetic stones, but
earrings, pendants, brooches, rings,
and bracelets with real diamonds,
pearls, and precious stones) also
made its reappearance at the state
functions, but most notably at the
reception and ball that was given
by President and Mrs. Quezon at
Malacanang as a despedida for the
visiting U. S. congressmen. This
affair was voted the most brilliant
of all social functions held during
the inaugural week.
A well-known dry goods store on
the Escolta that is patronized by the
elite of Manila society revealed
that fabrics that are rich not only
in texture but also in colors are now
the most favored for European as
well as for Filipino evening gowns.
These are the chiffons, plain and
flowered, lace shot with metal
threads, lame in silver and gold,
brocades, taffeta, moire, and velvet.
These fabrics range in cost from
five pesos to as high as fifteen
pesos a meter. It is not surpris¬
ing for a woman to spend as much
as seventy pesos for the material of
a gown alone. Here is an exam¬
ple: In a fashion show staged by
society girls in Manila for the Fox


Movietone and Paramount News
cameramen who were here for the
inaugural, one of the models wore
a terno made with ten meters of
lace costing twenty pesos a meter.
It is no secret that the skirt alone
that Miss Conchita Sunico, Manila
carnival queen last year, wore fon
her coronation cost two hundred
pesos. It was made of chiffon,
completely covered with sequins.
The sequins and the labor made it
very expensive.
At the last reception and ball
given by the Rho Alpha, most of
the girls wore velvet, with dark

and made by Jardin de MModas utilizea

colors predominating. The new
elegance in women’s evening clothes
was graphically shown in this af-
fair. The girls wore real evening
gowns on this gala occasion.
Because the fabrics mentioned
above are very rich, they do not re-
quire any trimming at all, but they
call for the use of equally rich ac¬
cesories in the form of elaborately
jeweled dress clips or brooches, belt
buckles, hair ornaments, earrings
and bracelets, not to mention even¬
ing bags with jeweled clasps.
In the evening, one must sparkle
from head to foot, as in the old days
when women wore jeweled pen¬
tuches in their hair and rhinestone


buckles on their shoes. What you
wear in your hair or on top of your
head does not matter; it may be a
tiara, a pair of clips, an aigrette,
a cluster of artificial or real flow¬
ers, or a string of pearls inter¬
woven in your hair. The more
sparkle it gives, the better. Then,
too, no neckline nowadays seems to
be complete without at least one
dress clip. Rhinestone dress clips
are very effective on dark-colored
velvets. Shoes are made to order
to match the dress or have rhine¬
stone buckles or heels. A very sell¬
able item in a jewelry store on the
Escolta is a convertible brooch that
may be separated into four pieces
to make a pair of ear clips and a
pair of dress clips.
Dona Pacita Longos, dean of
Manila modistes, confirmed this re-
turn of elegance in women’s clothes.
Dona Pacita has been making ter¬
nos for the smartest women of the
Philippines for over a decade now
and she has followed the changes
that have occurred in local fash-
ions. Before the depression, she
said, a terno costing fifty pesos
was only for shopping. With the
coming of the depression, women
ordered not only fewer gowns but
also less expensive ones. She is

na Mendoza, right, photographed at the
Rho Alnha ball. The first wears a vel¬
vet gown with an elaborate brooch at
the neckline; the second, printed satin
with a plain tulle cape held with jeweled
clasps.

the camisa and the panuelo, in or¬

centers on the cut of the skirt.

BORRTED TALCUN


after the World War, it is shown
that the major problems of Japan
before were left in the hands of the
Japanese youth. Because of tr
share of responsibility given to
youth of Japan, it was able to
culcate in the young the ideology of
national dignity and independence.
Japan, thus, was able to organize
the strongest army and navy in
the Orient, making her one of the
great world powers.
The same book tells also the his¬
tory of a tottering Poland, but two
Poles, named Sienkiewicz and Ma¬
teyko, appealed to the youth; the
first writing historical novels
portraying the greatness ef Poland
during the 17th century,
second immortalizing t
events in the history of tao--
try in paintings. These two move¬
ments had been sufficient to awaken
the Polish youth into tackling and
solving their national problems un¬
til they established the present
Polish republic.
Going back to our own nation, we
have our Rizal, the patriot, we have
our Osmena and Quezon—great
Filipinos worth emulating. Why
can’t then our youth be idealistic
to the core? Why can’t we be
united, be progressive? Right now
we need action, and a youth move¬
ment, like that of the United Youth
Party can furnish that need.

wards it. It was not the priest’s
but young Manuel's. Immediately
I grabbed at the hair and swam
ashore. I was dead tired when I
could pull my load safely to the
shore. Young Manuel was on the
verge of falling unconscious and so
we remained huddled, too tired to
move.”
The two remained thus for about
half an hour, after which they
gained sufficient strength to stand.
Sacristan Abdon scanned the sea
for the priest. He shouted with his
companions but no one answered.
There was no trace of the priest.
With the ten-year-old boy, the
three went back to the convent to
tell the accident to the other priests.
The body was found at around 11
o’clock by a group of volunteers a
kilometer away from the place
where the group had stood.
Young Quezon is Put in Jail
The following morning young
Quezon, Sacristan Abdon, and the
two convent helps found themselves
in jail. They were brought out and
cross-examined by Father Hernan¬
dez at about 9 o’clock. “Tell me the
truth, in the name of God,” he said,
"why you killed Father Angolo.”
“We were dumbfounded at the
accusation,” Abdon Poblete said.
“We protested, declaring that he
had drowned and that we had tried
to save him. Young Manuel and
the others were freed earlier than
I. It was not until after a week
that I could convince them of my
innocence and I was set free.”
A few years after the Baler bay
incident, young Manuel and Abdon
Poblete parted. The former sacris¬
tan went to Mauban. When he re-


turned to Baler later, he learned
that Quezon had gone to Manila.
That was shortly before the revolu¬
tion. Young Quezon was absent
from his home and his father and
his brother Pedro were mysterious¬
ly murdered allegedly by Katipune¬
ros in the town. The case was for¬
gotten until Quezon, already a law¬
yer practising in Lucena, un¬
earthed it and prosecuted the sus¬
pects. However, he himself worked
for their release later, perhaps re-
alizing that no good would come out
by avenging his kin.
The Two Meet Again
“All this I learned when Quezon
and I met again after a span of so
many years,” Abdon Poblete ex¬
plained. “That reunion was drama¬


tic. Somebody from Mauban who
had been a client of Atty. Quezon in
Lucena, happened to mention me to
him. A few weeks later, I received
a letter from Quezon, urging me to
visit him at his address.
“When we met, I did not recog¬
nize him at once because he had
grown big and was wearing a mous¬
tache. He hugged me like a long¬
lost brother, and in my joy a lump
swelled in my throat and I could
not utter a word. I certainly had
changed in appearance after so ma¬
ny years but he recognized me at
once. I learned from him later that
his father Don Lucio had instructed
him to love me as he loved him.”

The Teaching Of Poetry In Our Schools
By GONZALO M. PELAYO
Cotobato Publie School. Cotabato


FTENTIMES in our reading
lessons or elsewhere, we
come across pieces of poetry
which, although not exactly in¬
tended to be used as model poems
for the children, must neverthe¬
less be taught to them for their
pleasure or enjoyment. This, in
the end, should be the ultimate ob¬
jective in the teaching of litera¬
ture.
The inclusion of poetry in the
reading matter of the grade pupils
is justified for a number of rea¬
sons. Poetry, in the first place,
is the literary material we have
which calls for the highest play of
the reader’s imagination. Secondly
by means of it, the teacher has the
double chance of awakening the
latent tastes and attitudes of the
pupils and presenting to them in
words of beauty a new realm of
thought and feeling. Thirdly, our¬
grade pupils, being at the age when
their imaginative powers are dev¬
eloping, are highly receptive of
poetic inspirations once their im-
agination is properly aroused.
Teaching poetry in the wrong way
to them results either in the mis¬
guidance of their literary tastes at
an early age or the inhibition of
dominant artistic motives and apti¬
tudes as a result of disgust over
the subject matter.
In teaching a piece of poetry to
any class, two big things must be

borne in mind by the teacher.
namely, the poetic image and the
poetic mood, or the poetic picture
and the poetic feeling, respectively.
A stanza always contains one or
both of these. A whole poem com¬
posed of several stanzas is a whole
picture made up of a number of
images. Or, in the case (in lyrics
generally) where the poem expres¬
ses the moods more strongly than
the images, the whole piece may be
a feeling of various moods or shades
of sentiment. Since a piece of
poetry generally expresses an idea
or feeling as a whole, it is often
advisable to start the lesson by
reading the whole piece. Such read¬
ing must be made with proper em¬
phasis on the euphony and thought
and is best done by a good reader
in the class or by the teacher. A
reading of the whole piece ought to
give the pupils a general idea of
the story or what the poem is about.
Going over the stanzas one after
another is the next step to be taken
in order to effect a vivid visualiza¬
tion of the poetic image and make
the impression more lasting in the
pupils’ minds. Where the poetic
mood is emphasized an appeal to
the heart rather than to the imag¬
ination is a better approach.
Discovering The Poetic Image
And The Poetic Mood
The most important and interest-
ing step in the teaching of poetry
is the discovery of the poetic image
or feeling. In order to accomplish
this, the teacher has to resort to a
number of devices. One way is to
bring to class pictures or views of
scenes that best depict the image
conveved in the poem. An exam¬
ple may be made by teaching Ro¬
bert Browning’s Pippa Passes. The
picture can be driven cosely to the
children’s minds by showing them
a picture of a rustic scene or an
Italian peasant girl.
Obviously, the poetic image or
feeling of a stanza is contained in
the very lines themselves. Poetry
is a drawing in words and lines,
what a painter may draw on can¬
vas in curves or figures by means
of his brush and colors, or what a
sculptor may mould out of stone and
marble by means of his chisel and
hammer. Resorting to the use of
the dictionary for the meaning of
keywords in the poem usually
proves interesting to the pupils and
awakens their initiative and self-
reliance. Such words must be
chosen with care and discrimin-
ation with the hope that the pupils
may enjoy doing their assignment.

YHEN I was a small boy, my
"yaya" who was an old wo¬
Wman alvays tla me veid
stories before I went to sleep. She
told me of the “aswang,” of the
“camacama," of the "tamao," and
many other ghost tales. Every
time I cried she would tell me that
the “aswang” would come and take
me away. I would stop crying then
for I was afraid and I believed my
"yaya” and what she told me. She
always told me that the ghosts dis¬
like so much the naughty boys, and
that I should be a good boy in or¬
der that the ghosts would not hurt
me or take me away to their homes
in the mountains. I was very much
afraid because of those weird sto¬
ries, but I always asked my "yaya’
to tell me some stories and she was
very glad to do so.

When the family decided to go to
the farm or to some other place, my
"yaya” would wrap a piece of gin¬
ger and place it inside my cami¬
seta. She told me that the ginger
will keep away the malignant spir¬
its and protect me from any harm.
Once when we went to the farm she
told me to tie the grass and the
vines into knots so we would not
lose our way, or, that the “tamao”
might not mislead us.. She even
told me to kiss a big stone beside
the spring. I hesitated- at first,
but she told me that we should res¬
pect the hospitality of the fairies
and to regard their supernatural
powers. I then kissed the big stone
'yaya” those
for I believed my
days. I was pointing at something
when she scolded me. She told me
that it is not good to point at any
thing I see. She also told me not
to throw something for I might hit
the “camacama" or the "tamao."
But now! There’s a great dif-
ference. My loving "yaya” is
dead and I mourn for her. For all
her superstitious beliefs, I forgive
her—but, for other things that she
had done for me, I honor her and
am
will remember her always.
glad that she is dead now, for I will
no longer hear her tales about the
"aswang,” the “camacama,” the
“tamao," and all other superstitions.

QUESTIONS:—My brother who
is 18 years old has been complain¬
ing of running ears with foul smell.
He has been suffering from it
ever since he was a child. I advised
him to clean his ears but it did not
do any good to him. What causes
running ears? Are there medicines
that can cure it? What is the best
treatment for it?—A  
reader, Cagayan, Oriental Misa¬
mis.
ANSWERS:—Running ears are
due to infections, and they are
curable. You are advised to con¬
sult a local physician or the health
officer for proper treatment.
—Answered by Dr. Jose P Bantug,
chief, health & publicity section,
bureau of health, Manila.
QUESTION:—My son has been
attacked by fever for several days
and now is getting hard of hear¬
ing. What test should be appliec
to him if there is any?—Avaristo
Sayo, Dagupan, Manila.
ANSWER:—There are many
tests for determining acuteness of


hearing. But two very simple
tests, however, which are more or
less reliable are the watch test
and the voice test. In the watch
test the person to be tested sits in
a chair with his eyes covered. The
room must be kept very quiet.
The ear not to be tested is closed
by the forefinger of the person to
be tested. The person making the
test holds a watch close to the
ear of the person to be tested and
allows it to remain until its tick
is very distinctly heard by that
person. It is then removed to a
considerable distance and brought
very siowly closer and closer to
the ear, noting the exact distance
from the person when the ticking
first becomes audible. The tester
then notes how far distant the
watch can be heard by a normal
ear, his own. If the watch tick is
heard by the normal ear at thirty
inches and by the ear of the per¬
son tested at only fifteen inches
the hearing is said to be only 15-
20 n o r m a l.—From “Physical
Culture.


QUESTIONS:—is the University
of Hongkong offering a course in

ANSWERS:—Full information
about the university may be ob¬
tained fro- the University calen¬
dar which is on sale at H. K.

School Certificate examination or
passed an examination recognized
by the General Medical Council
of Great Britain and Ireland as
quivalent thereto, i. e, an exam¬
ation to their matriculation
mination.
e degrees for which this
univsity prepares students in

B.S., an M. D., M. S. The course
for the V.B., B.S., takes 5 years
after premedical study. Enrol¬
ment takes place in September
each year and it costs a student


about P3,000 a year to live in this
university. This includes tuition
board and lodging, books, clothes,
and pocket money.—Answered by

the power to search a store with-
out any warrant for anything he
might allege? Can he arrest vio¬

ANSWERS:—An internal rev¬
enue agent may, in the discharge
of his official duties, enter any
house, building or place where
articles subject to specific tax
are produced or kept, or believed
by him upon reasonable grounds
to be produced or kept, so far as
may be necessary to examine or
discover the same even without a
search warrant. An internal rev¬

"Dawson,” I said, as quietly as I
could. "Look!
He glanced up in the direction I
indicated.
“Oh, by jove, by jove!” he said
softly under his breath.
It was the young Englishman of
Monte Carlo!
I know that my face was flushed
with excitement, and I heard the
fork in Dawson’s hand clatter
sharply against his plate. After¬
ward, in our room, we talked it
over. Upon one thing we were
agreed; we would ask the English-
man, point blank if need be, what
was behind the mask of the Woman
in Red. That he was the same boy,
grown older more in looks than in
years, whom we had seen at Monte
Carlo was certain; that he was
again in his right mind the circum¬
stances attested, and that we must
learn what he saw that night in the
gardens was, perhaps, the most ab¬
solutely certain thing in the world.
We must know even at the risk of
unsettling his reason again by re¬
calling the frightful incident. Daw¬
son remarked grimly that it would
be better to unsettle his than to lose
ours, and delegated to me the task
of bringing about an interview.
I bungled badly, but I managec
it. Meeting him in the hotel lobby,
I claimed a previous acquaintance
with him on the Continent, using
glibly enough his name, which I bad
ascertained from the clerk. Being
a gentlernan and a slow-minded sub¬
ject of Her Majesty, he did not dis¬
claim me, and a quarter of an hour
later he and Dawson and I sat to¬
gether in our room, talking genially
between the puffs of our cigars. W
found topics of common interest in
plenty and spent a pleasant hour
chatting over our travels and the
ranching possibilities of Arizona
in which the Englishman was evi¬
dently interested. Dawson began
to grow uneasy and signaled to me
to play trumps. Before I could
think how to begin, the Englishman
asked suddenly: “By the way, where
did you say you ran across me?”
I had not said, but I did now,
looking at him squarely:
"At Monte Carlo, two winters
ago.” The fine color left his face.
“You remember,” I continued
cruelly, "it was the winter of the
Woman in Red sensation.” He put
up his hand to hide his trembling,
ashen lips.
“For heaven’s sake, don’t!”
he
cried. But there was no thought of
finesse on our part. Dawson leaned
forward, his eyes big with eager¬
ness.
“What,” he fairly shouted, "was
behind that woman’s mask?”
And this is the story we persuad¬
ed the Englishman to tell. He drew
farther back into the shadows of
the room as he told it, his hand go¬
ing up now and then to cover his
lips, which trembled in spite of
him.
“You know the whole wretched
affair, of course,” he said, "if you
were in Monte Carlo at the time.


wish I had not been! You saw how
the Count and the Baron and I made
fools of ourselves over the woman,
I the most blatantly, without doubt.
Heaven knows I could not help it,
and I doubt if any man of my years
and temperament could have done
so. Whether it was partly the baf-
fling mystery of her mask I do not
know, but there was a fascination
about her that was irresistible. I
begged her on my knees to let me
see her face, begged a dozen times
a day, but she would only turn away
with a bitter little laugh. The more
she refused my request, the more
convinced I became that she was
beautiful and that her mask was
only a caprice. I formed in my
mind a face to fit her hair and her
white hands and her charm alto¬
gether—a face so clear to me that,
had I been an artist, I could have
painted it. I was madly jealous of
the suave old Count and the witless
Baron, and they of me, but gradu¬
ally I gained favor with her, until
it was she and I who, as a rule,
walked together and talked together
and gamed together, I following her
scarlet gown as if bewitched.
“One night we left the Casino,
where we had been playing, and
went out into the gardens, away
from the heat of the crowded
rooms. Outside the moon made it
as light as day. She was restless
and nervous and would not sit down,
so we walked to and fro on the ter¬
races. The air was heavy with the
scent of roses, and the moonlight
was like wine. Half drunk with it
and the gleam of her scarlet, I—oh,
well, never mind that. I begged her
again to take off her mask, and she
answered lightly that she had not
come out to talk of that. Angry at
her refusal, I sulked like a child.
She began listlessly slipping her
ring up and down on her finger,
and presently it slipped off and
dropped to the ground. Before I
could prevent her, she stooped to
find it. A branch of a shrub caught
in her hair and she drew back her
head with a quick, nervous start to
free it. I heard a little click, and
her mask fell upon the gravel walk.
Then I saw what I had longed so
much to see."
Dawson sat up straight in his
chair and my own pulse leaped.
“She was deformed, birth-marked,
leprous—or the Devil!” broke in
my friend.
The young Englishman drew far¬
ther back into the shadows.
"No,” he answered nervelessly.
Dawson and I stared at each oth-
er, but something in the man’s at¬
titude kept us silent.
“There was a girl once at home
in England,” the shaking voice went
on after a pause, “Margaret Alli¬
son, the daughter of a glover.
thought I loved her: at any rate, I
told her so, for she was pretty, con¬
foundedly so, and I was a young
fool. Then I found out my mis¬
take. I remember—I shall never
forget—how she looked and smiled
at me when I told her I could not
marry her. She—she killed herself,
and I went to Monte Carlo and lost

((IT has something of the gentle
I quietness of the Eagles Mere in
Pennsylvania, the languorous effect of
the Saranac Lake of New York, the
poetic enchantment of the Lake of Lu¬
cerne, as well as the soothing, consol¬
ing effects of the lakes of Interlaken,
Switzerland."
Thus exults a much-travelled busi¬
ness man about Lake Taal. Lake Taal
is a body of water which occupies a
unique place not only in the list of
the Island’s beauty spots but also in
the country’s history.


This body of water has an area of
about 326 square kilometers, an ave¬
rage depth of 10 meters, and has an
elevation of about 2.5 meters above sea
level. It is connected with the sea by
the Pansipit river. Its wealth of fish
has made it not only one of the favorite
picnic places in the province of Ba¬
tangas but also a rich source of
wealth.
Nestling in the midst of the lake is
an island on which one of the most
famous and most unique of the world’s
volcanoes rises. Taal volcano is con¬


sidered one of the lowest volcanoes in
the world and believed to have the
widest and deepest crater. There are
some indications that Lake Taal might
be the crater of an ancient large vol¬
cano now extinct. In this case, the
present Taal volcano would be a vol¬
cano on top of another volcano!
The ideal location of the lake at¬
tracted people from near-by islands ma¬
ny centuries ago. When Martin de
Goiti and Juan de Salcedo, leading 120
soldiers, on a mission of reducing “the


infidels to the vassalage of Spain and
the blessed teachings of the Holy
Church," passed this lake, they encoun¬
tered a flourishing native village around
the place. The hostility of the na¬
tives caused de Goiti to abandon his
mission. The Taal lake towns have been
able to preserve some distinctly Filipi¬
no characteristics and Doctor David P.
Barrows, former director of the Bureau
of Education, has said that the purest
Tagalog language is spoken in this re¬
gion.


money to forget about it. Now,
you may believe this or not, as you
can, but when that woman’s mask
fell, I saw at first a Thing—not a
human face, but a terrible white
blur—and out of this came Marga¬
ret’s face, which looked at me with
awful, hurt eyes, and with that
smile—O God, that smile! And
Margaret lay dead in England. You
know the rest. I believe I was
crazed for a time, winding up with
a fever. Not till long, long after
did I learn the final tragedy in the
"Woman in Red’ sensation, coming
across it one day, while searching
for something else in a file of old
papers. There! you have my sto¬
ry.
He rose and leaned against the
mantel for a moment.
"Do you wonder,” he asked sim¬
ply, “that my hair is getting
gray?” Dawson’s thin hands were
twitching nervously.
"But what do you think—” he
began.
The Englishman stopped him au¬
thoritatively and turned to go.
“if I
“I do not think,” he said,
can help it—not of that!"


When we were alone we could on¬
ly sit and look at each other.
"Dawson,” I asked finally, "what
do you think?”
And Dawson smiled a very
ghastly smile.
“I do not think,” he answered. "I
cannot."
We did not have much time to
think after that, for the state of
Dawson’s health became so alarm¬
ing that I had to telegraph for his
mother and sister. Together we
pulled him up again, and I, called
home on business, left him conval¬
escing in the sunshine.
I had been home barely a month
when I received a letter from an old
French physician, a resident of.
Monte Carlo, who had won a pile of
bright twenty-franc pieces from
me that eventful winter. This is
an English version of his letter:
MY DEAR K.—Do you remember
the Woman in Red and her career
that winter you were here? Do you
remember the priest who went mad?
Do you remember our interest in it
all? Mon Dieu! A few days ago I
was called to attend that priest, be¬
cause I have some skill and am very
cheap. I found him horribly ill; no


hope, but perfectly sane—he had
been that way for some days they
told me—only not so ill. You know
the mind sometimes comes back to
a madman shortly before death. His
face was yellow, like parchment, and
shriveled like a shrunk olive, with
eyes—ah, Diable, what eyes! He
tried all the time to speak, but could
not. Finally he signed to me, then
fell back, dying miserably. After¬
ward, I found this paper beneath his
pillow, written by him apparently in
his lucid interval. What do you
think of it? Mon Dieu, I do not
know what to think! Read for your¬
self.
The paper enclosed, in a pitiful¬
ly weak hand, read as follows:
Has it been years, or months, or
days that I have been here? They
will not tell me. I swear that my
mind again is clear as I write this
—swear it by the Sacred Host and
the blessed Mother of Heaven. Yes¬
terday I heard them whisper among
themselves that I must die, and 1
feel that it is so. Before I die I
must confess what I saw behind the
mask of the Woman in Red, -ince
that was the sight which made me
mad, and has kept ine here these
years, or months, or weeks. Per¬
haps some one coming after me can
explain it—some one more versed


the riddles of a weary world.
Before I lifted the mask from the
face of this Scarlet Woman that day
—whenever it was—I prayed, kneel¬
ing on the floor beside her, as one
would for the soul of a sinner. I
expected to see some disfigurement,
hideous enough to be concealed, but
nothing more. So it was with com¬
parative calmness that I passed my
hand under her bright hair, loosened
the metal catch and raised the fatal
velvet. Oh, that I could blot out
what I saw! That it might not come
before my eyes again!
At first a white and fearful and
shapeless Thing, not human. Then,
though the creature was dead be¬
fore me, there struggled into this
a face, so faint I could barely see
it, but, have mercy upon me, Mer¬
ciful One! it was the face' of my
old mother, with livid, purple lips,
looking at me as she did when I,
with my boy’s hands, crushed out
her life maddened by her cursed
tongue. For long years I had kept
my deed a secret, but it cried up to
me from this woman—how I knew
not. The face stayed only long
enough to stare at me and burn it¬
self into my brain forever—then it
faded away. All this time, how
long it is I do not know, I have had
before me that fearful, unheard of
Thing, through which something has

als, are gradually driven out of the
church by the sacristan and al¬
lowed to dance only in front of the
church’s entrance.
How the sinulog originated, no¬
body can exactly tell. However,
there are not a few Cebuanos to-day
who can tell you that this peculiar
way of dancing began way back
three hundred years ago. They re¬
late that during the early Spanish
days in Cebu, the Senor Santo Ni¬
no used to dance the sinulog in the


presence of many people outside
of its gold-gilded, diamond-studded
repository in the ancient convent of
the Augustinian friars.
It is said that attempts of some
of the new Augustinian friars in
Cebu to discourage people and
children from dancing the sinulog
have been made without effective
results. It seems that the deep-
rooted custom, handed down from
generation to generation, is des¬
tined to live for the centuries yet
to come.

and it deserves to be perpetuated.
Of course, in other parts of the
Philippines where the word po is
not used, this suggestion cannot
apply, but whatever is used there
for po deserves perpetuation.
The apparent decline of courtesy
in the Islands should not be placed
on colleges and schools, for these
institutions, although they offer no
formal courses in courtesy, do not
unmake a gentleman. Perhaps it
is the awkward position the youth
finds himself in: between the old
standard of courtesy and those
brought from the New World, which
makes him somewhat undecided as
to which to choose. And in his in¬
decision, he naturally does away
with both.
I do not believe, however, in di¬
viding standards of courtesy here
into Spanish and American. Neither
should be considered superior to the
other. What we Filipinos should
do is to pick out from both the best
that will fit our particular needs as
a people. For after all, courtesy
has no nationality.
We should read Don Teodoro M.
Kalaw’s recent book entitled “Cinco
Reglas de Nuestra Moral Antigua,
especially Chapter 3 on “Courtesy”
and Chapter 5 on "Family Unity.”
These two books will furnish us
practically all we need in the mat¬
ter of courtesy in our contact with
people. While I believe in accept-
ing the best of foreign courtesy
practices that fit our needs as a
people it seems sound and necessa¬
ry for us to preserve our own tradi¬
tional practices as a people.

last January 25th. Four teams
clashed in the bout for champion¬
ship: the Banga Rural High School
tennis club represented by Honesto
Macahilig and Escolastico Indelible
the invading team of the Aklan
Academy in Kalibo, Capiz, ably re¬
presented by Vicente Teodosio and
Faustino Catapang, the Kalibo Insti¬

represented by Napoleon R. Abi¬
tang. In the doubles, the Pastrana¬
Abitang partnership, representa¬

out with flying colors. The Aklan

Championship honors went to
the San Nicolas Elementary School
with 84 points when the Cebu city

NEWLY ORGANIZED SCOUT
TROOP


A few members of Boy Scout
Troop 159 of the Albay High School,
which was organized through the
efforts of Mr. Victor Pineda, field
commissioner; Mr. Marical Pones
and Mr. C. Panesa, scoutmasters;
and the troop committee men
(members of the faculty of the
high school). (Courtesy, Juan Bel¬
gica, Life Scout, Troop No. 159,

came out a close third. The super-
vising teacher, Mr. Porfirio M.
Miel, assisted by a host of princi¬
pals and subordinates, was behind
every success in this last city school
district meet.
It will be recalled that San Nico¬
las School has traditionally been
the general championship winner in
the past city school district meets.
This time, however, even if other
schools have not been declared
champions, they won the champion¬
ship in some particular events. Za¬
patera School won all the girls’ in¬
door baseball and volleyball mat¬
ches; the City Intermediate, the
track and field; while San Nicolas,
the baseball, basketball, and the
ping-pong. San Nicolas won over
the other schools just by a very nar¬
row margin.
The donors of the prizes were:
La Esmeralda, for the general
champion; Mr. Paulino Valdez,
baseball; Go Lam and Co., indoor
baseball; Mr. Jovito Elemia, basket
ball; La Republica, volleyball; Mr.
Paulino Gullas, track events; Mrs.
Esperanza Velez, field events; Mr.
Marcos Morelos, boys’ ping-pong;
and Mrs. Rufina F. Miel and Miss
Carmen Omana, girls’ ping-pong.


The junior and senior students
of the Cebu Normal School re¬

the members.

Executive Order No. 16 issued
by the President last Thursday
prohibits the automatic renewal
of government contracts. The or¬
der provides that "no contract for
public service already in force or
to be entered into by the Philip¬
pine government or any of its
branches, subdivisions, agencies,
or instrumentalities shall be re¬
newed without public bidding,
except for very extraordinary
reasons, and then only after the
Auditor General, the Secretary of
Justice, and the Secretary of the
department concerned have been
consulted and my approval has
been secured beforehand."

February 8th, the date when the
constitution was approved by the
Constitutional Convention, was last
Friday designated Constitution Day
by President Quezon. However, this
year the observance of the framing
of the constitution will be made on


the 19th of February.
* 
President Quezon told the press
last Friday that he is studying the
case of the sweepstakes employees
who were recently ordered disqua¬
lified by the auditor general for
their not being civil service eli¬
gibles. The President said that
though the constitution provides
that government officials must
have civil service qualifications,
it also allows several exceptions.
So far, he has not decided whether
the sweepstakes office falls under
one of these exceptions.
NATIONAL ASSEMBLI
For not being civil service elig¬
ibles, 34 new employees of the Na-
tional Assembly were ordered dis¬
missed the other Tuesday by the
bureau of civil service. This action
of the bureau is in line with the
executive order of President Que¬
zon enforcing the civil service pro¬
visions of the constitution. Not


long before this, 100 employees of
the charity sweepstakes office were
dismissed for the same reason.

killer, was the servant of the de-

that the killing could not have been
accidental.

quing. She would call me Dick and
she did. I did not like the nick-
name.
A month ended. A month of un¬
naturally long nights to me. Ser¬
enaders were always around Mari¬
quing. There was no use going to
bed early. I wanted to shout to the
serenaders, tell them to have a mind
for the neighbors. But I did not
shout, not once. I would sit on the
balcony for hours waiting for the
serenaders to leave. But they sel¬
dom left early. And there in the
balcony I could only think of that
girl and hated her more every time
I had to stay up late waiting for
her friends to go home to bed.
Many times I wanted to tell her
what I really thought of her.
wanted to tell her to go back to the
city. She belonged there. I wanted
to tell her she had been the cause
of my sleepless nights. If she would
only leave Kaisiwan soon, she would
be obliging me greatly.
One morning I failed to see her.
Where could that woman be? J
wondered if she had left at last and
I paced about the house and yard
eyeing her aunt’s house surrepti¬
tiously for any sign of her. I made
sly inquiries and Father informed
me Mariquing, with the members of
Aling Juana’s household, had gone
to the liaban that morning in a cart.
Their going, I found out, was
planned only last night. So we did
not know about it.
Mariquing’s party returned after
dusk. They were all smiles, they
must have enjoyed the trip im¬
mensely. I saw her coming up our
house and heard her calling for Sis¬


ter. She gave Sister a little bun¬
dle wrapped in buri leaves and some
other thing in a bamboo tube. I
knew what they were. We brought
home the same stuff from the lia¬
ban when we went there once.
How did she like the trip? Sister
asked. Fine. She had a grand time.
Everything was grand. How an¬
noying. She said the day would
have been better for her had Sister
been along. I did not believe her.
Trite! Everybody would say the
same thing.
Mariquing told Sister that the
cakes of buri sugar were for her.
“The thing in the bamboo tube is
for Dick.”
“Tuba?” Sister interrupted,
slightly shaking the tube.
“You guessed it,” Mariquing re¬
plied promptly. “It is very sweet.
Taken from a very old palm. But
I know your brother will not drink
it. He hates me. Your housemaid
told me once that he never ate any
food from our house. Better give it
to your father.”
“It is not true that Ricardo re¬
fuses to eat what you give us,
Sister explained, pinching Mari¬
quing’s cheeks. Mariquing laughed
but stopped when she saw me at the
window.
He hates me! He hates me! I
read it in her eyes. How did she
know? I had talked to her only
once—the night we were intro¬
duced.
That same night Mariquing came
again. Sister and I were singing
in the balcony when she appeared.
We stopped in the middle of a song.
She excused herself for coming un¬
asked. The next day she and her
mother would be going back to Ma¬

liaban this morning unexpectedly?'
Sister guessed. Mariquing nod¬
ded.
She had come for the last time
and she liked it to be the happiest
night of her stay in our barrio. She
made it happy to her by all means.
Sister and she sang. Sometimes
Sister and I. Then, because she
asked me, she and I.
At nine, Nita reminded her of her
departure the next day. She needed
rest. She bade us goodby, ask¬
ing us not to forget to write to
her always. She might not come
again to see our barrio.
Nita promised we would always
remember her. Mariquing kissed
Sister good night and goodby. Then
she turned to me. Her grasp was
warm and firm.
I escorted her downstairs and
found I was still holding her hand.
I told myself that was to be the last
night, I should be really more de¬
cent. In the moonlight she said,
“Ricardo, why do you hate me so?”
and before I could lie and say it was
not so she had fled to her aunt’s
house.
The next day I woke up to find
Mariquing and her Mother had left.
DID not think of her for many
months. But last night she
came to me—in a dream. I was tel¬
ling her I loved her. She was telling
me she hated me—very much, be¬
cause I was lying, I did not mean
what I was saying. Then I seized
her, gathered her in my arms and
her soft warm body nestled against
mine without protest. She looked
up and I saw in her eyes she no
longer hated me.
“Mariquing,” I said, “I have nev¬
er loved so honestly in my life as
to-night.”
Then I woke up. And wondered
why I dreamt of her—that way.

WHY SHOULDN'T I KILL...

an incurable disease either in mind
or in body might be expedited."
But the judge warned that if eu¬
thanasia should ever be authorized,
"it could be given only under the
most rigorous safeguards, and not
left to the uncontrolled discretion
of a relative. Many a sick person
might otherwise be put into unmer¬
ited danger.”
With the following concept of
how real euthanasia should work
expressed by an English physician,
Dr. Henry Roberts, I find nothing
to quarrel with:
"If assistance is, in certain
circumstances, to be officially af¬
forded a suicide, we must make
sure that the suicide is voluntary.
It is one thing to ease the death
of someone we care for and for
whom we are responsible, at his
own request and for his own re¬
lief; it is another, and a very dif¬
ferent thing to kill him because
that seems to be the most econo¬


mical or, to the survivors, the most
agreeable way of dealing with
him."



I AM A TUBERCULAR
Continued from page 54

which it has been perfected, has its
many limitations. And if science is
scientific, it must recognize its im¬
potency in more phases of life than
one, to solve many serious prob¬
lems that afflict the spirit of man
Where science fails it does not mean
that everything else will fail. Many
truths and mysteries there are
that are not revealed in the eyes of
the microscope. I make this state¬
ment in support of no religious at¬
titude. Religion is only a way of
life, and it is not the whole way
It is only a way of seeking God,
but it is not God.
Euthanasia, let us hope, is per¬
haps an attempt to create a situa¬
tion of heaven on the sad and care¬


worn planet of man. But its philo¬
sophy is based on the wrong pre-
sumption that man is unequal to
his apportioned tasks and trials,
and an acknowledgment of evil over
faith. It is an acknowledgment,
further, of the defeat of medicine
in its refusal to push its investiga¬
tions through, into the treatment
of evil. For by killing all incurable
persons, the doctors write finis on
everything. If euthanasia was
practised in the past, it surely was
done in backward and irresponsible
generations. Voluntarily ending
the life of a suffering person ends
the suffering for that person alone.
But for those who live constantly
under the fear of such diseases
pronounced with finality as incur¬
able, the suffering cannot be told.
Euthanasia, therefore, kills the
hope and faith of mankind, and
without hope and faith how much
happiness can there be in the life
of a race?

A quarrel over a bunch of bana¬
nas resulted in the stabbing of
Braulio Tabayag, 32, of Barrio
Santo Domingo, Iriga, last Janua¬
ry 26th by Pio Investro, assisted
by Atanacio Tabayag and Anatolio
Balbuena of the same barrio. The as¬
sailants used a knife and a dagger
and wounded Tabayag twice in the
right shoulder and once in the left
hip. The victim was in a serious
condition shortly after the attack.

Barrio San Juan Candaba, died the

Thirteen persons were injured the
other Monday morning in Mana¬

ger truck bound for Ilocos Sur fell
off the Sapang bridge. Most of
the injured passengers are from
Narvacan and Candon (Ilocos Sur).
According to the Manaoag police
chief, the truck met a bull cart in
the middle of the bridge, and in at¬
tempting to avoid hitting it swered
to one side and fell off the bridge.
Merchandise worth P450 was dam¬

The nomination of Graciano Pi¬

accused of abuse of chastity when
he was a school teacher, resulting
in his dismissal from the position.

people in the neighborhood. She
was smart, by unanimous opinion
of the young blades. The children
called her Bob because of her
bobbed hair. She did not like being
called Bob. The old folk also
talked about her—that is to say,
they did not like her. Young wo¬
men of their time did not cut their
hair. There was no such thing as
hair-waving, rouge or lipstick
And the women then covered them-
selves. Not like the city girl who
prides in exposing her body.
Soon the city girl, I refrained
from calling her Mariquing of Ma¬
riquita, became the recipient of fre¬
quent visits from young men who
were either frankly curious or hard-
smitten..
Once there was a group of sere¬
naders. The youthful swains sang
creditably and they were asked to
come up. They did. Mang Can¬
dong, Aling Juana’s husband, had
to yank a hen from the roost. The
hen protested violently, but the
serenaders needed nourishment.
That night I did not know when the
serenaders left. Maybe at dawn.
The girl sang, too. But why did
they make her sing all the time?
thought it was unkind. They should
stop her after the first song. That
would be enough punishment. For
her voice—well, her voice was ir¬
ritating, shrill, and harsh. Why
did they applaud her, egg her on as
if she were some prima donna?
Very cruel of them, I thought.
I avoided mentioning her name—
and meeting her, more. It was so
warm indoors. Sister and I were
sitting on the trunk of a caman¬
chile tree which Father had felled.
He said it was too old and weak it
might crash from its own weight.
So despite our protestations, argu¬
ing its fruit was delicious, he felled
it.
The girl came down, too, and

PHILATELY MAGAZINE
MAKES BOW
The "AFF” (official organ of
the Asociacion Filatelica de Filipi¬
nas), a pioneer English-Spanish
monthly dedicated to philately,
made its first bow early this month.
The purposes of the publication are
“to defend the interests of philate¬
ly and those who cultivate it, spread
among its readers up-to-date knowl¬
edge on this score, and to promote
intensive and extensive study of
the same... to see to it that by all
possible means Philippine stamps
gain international popularity and
deserve, by reason of their histor¬
ical and philatelic value, a preemi¬
nent place in public estimation."
Its honorary contributors are Vi¬

Was the Woman in Red a key¬

the dead—helpless clay, moulded by
unseen forces? Had each one who
had lifted her mask beheld beneath
it the most awful vision of which
he could conceive? Would the old

In spite of the diligence exercised
by the parties in their desire to
have their disputes ended at the
earliest possible time, a final deci¬
sion of either case seems far from
materializing in the immediate fu¬
ture. Only the said court knows
when! If this can happen in the
capital of the nation where the
judges have in their favor the pre¬
sumption that they are masters in


the science of law, what can we not
expect to happen in the remote parts
of our country?
After 35 years of constant ef¬
forts, automobile engineers and
mechanics have succeeded in multi¬
plying tenfold the speed of auto¬
mobiles and in giving to modern
cars all the comforts and conveni¬
ences that human ingenuity can
conceive of; naval engineers have
also wonderfully shortened by more
than one-half what before were long
distances; the radio and the air¬
plane have made all countries close
neighbors, and have quickened our
means of transportation. But in
direct contrast to all these marve¬
lous signs of progress, we, lawyers
and judges, steadfastly cling to the
pillar of old traditions without any
intention of eliminating many of
our extravagant and unnecessary
proceedings, or, at least, of short-
ening the periods for the filing of
pleadings.
President Quezon, who by his
recent acts and policies seems to
be determined to give the people
a New Deal in the administration
of justice, will find his dream
realized not only by appointing
highly capable men to the judi¬
ciary, but also by giving the peo¬
ple a judicial procedure which is
in consonance with the spirit and
progress of our time.

Little Blue Book Co, and members of their
families.
2. Opposite each of the jumbled words
list your solution and tell whether it is a river,
city, town, mountain, etc. The identification
must not be more than one word. For example,
your solution for the first jumble might be
LAIP-LIPA-Town.
3. In case any name has more than onc
application, either or any correct identilication¬
will have equal weight in this contest.
4. Contestants may hand in as many solu¬
tions as they like provided that each solution is
accompanied by an order (cash or money order,
not stanips; of at least 80-centavo worth of
Little Blue Books. Use the solution blank for
your solutions and jot down the number of the
books you want in the order blank.
5. The weight of the solution for each
word is 4% and the identification, 1%, making
a total of 5%. A perfect solution and identifi¬
cation of the 40 words will then give you a
rating of 200%. The contestant obtaining the
highest rating gets the first prize; the next
highest the second prize, etc.
6. There will be three sets of the Jumbled

CLOSED?
following the initiation of the drive
against gambling, a number of gambling joints have already been closed.
We are not doubting this. We are even willing to believe that more gam¬
bling dens will close soon.
But to our way of thinking this is not the important point in any
drive to suppress gambling. More important is the answer to this ques¬
tion: Will these gambling joints stay closed?
We have lost count of the number of drives that have been ordered
against gambling these last few years. But there have been many. And
yet it has been necessary, lately, for the President, no less, to order a
new one.
This is not predicting that even this last one will fail to accomplish
anything. But if it does accomplish something it is because the drive
has ceased to become the mere gesture that such a drive has always been:
a raid here and there until an aroused public sinks again into compla¬
cency; an understanding with influential gambling joint operators to lay
low for a while until the people get interested in something else.

yE have in this issue an article by Atty. Gui¬
SIGNIFICANT
 llermo Guevara, ex-fiscal of Manila and
former court of first instance judge. Just how antiquated judicial proce¬
dure is here, how slowly the local machinery of justice operates, Judge
Guevara points out clearly and pointedly in this article. There is nothing
new, of course, in the charge that our judicial machinery is rickety and
in need of some sort of overhauling. But the iteration of the charge by
no less than an, outstanding member of the local bar who is a former
fiscal and judge, who knows thus the workings of the local judiciary
thoroughly, gives the charge necessary significance.

NOW FOR RESULTS
Apeals, except one, have been named.
All but two of those already named have been sworn in. The new court is
now functioning.
Now the thing to remember is that the new court has been created
to improve the functioning of the judicial machinery. The President
from all indications was very meticulous in his selection of judges for
the new court. When the selections were announced, there was unan¬
imous approval of the men selected. We now, therefore, have the new
court and the right men for the said court.
Let us wait for results.

LAND FOR TENANTS
L nounced that in the reselling of the
big estates which the government is planning to buy from the present
owners he would see to it that influential people and government emplo¬
yees do not get the major portion of these lands. The announcement is
timely. The estates are being bought for the benefit primarily of tenants
now working on these estates. Every precaution should be taken to pre¬
vent those who already have sufficient lands from horning in and depriv-
ing the landless from benefiting from these estates. The precaution is
necessary for in the reselling of the first friar lands bought by the gov-
ernment, such horning in did take place.

Only Suspension?
y E read the other day that
W the police force of Manila is
seeking the suspension of two
medicos who find it more profitable
than ordinary practice to give a mo¬
dified form of euthanasia to those
who find it interesting to die slowly
and painlessly: there are people
who like to stuff their hides witla
morphine and the two doctors
have been very accommodating.
Said the police: "As long as
these physicians are allowed to
open their clinics there will be no
end to the illegal injection of mor¬
phine in Manila.”
Then why only a suspension?
*
A Court In The Making


TTHE Court of Appeals was sup¬
1 posed to function beginning
February 1st.
When the judges for this
court were sworn in, and only
eight of the ten selected out of the
eleven the Court must have had
taken their oath, it was already
February 7th.
Now only a minor detail re¬
mains to be done and the Court
can start functioning: the small
matter of determining who out¬
ranks whom in the Court, a simple
affair that will only force the
Court to always sit in bane until
the rankings of the judges are fully
determined. After this matter of
rankings is disposed of, the Court
can finally be divided in two divi¬
sions as provided by law and can
sfunction normally thereafter.

Why Only Japan?
wT has been the custom in this
A neighborhood to say at the least
opportunity that the Philippines
will lose her independence the mo¬
ment good old Uncle Sam gets out
here. A villain will surely come
around and grab this country of
ours from us. And the villain, of
course, will be Japan.
It is not hard to understand
just why Japan will want to grab
the P. I. And Japan is no amateur
grahber. But what we cannot un¬
derstand is why Japan alone is
pictured as the possible grabber
when there are quite a number of
others who can, if they wish, get
the Philippines from the Filipinos.
How about England, the Nether¬
lands, and France?
