—OMETIMES we are glad this world
is getting tougher and tougher:
P Mussolini going over to Ethiopia
and booting a king of kings, no less, to
Jerusalem (almost to kingdom come),
Hitler stepping into the Rhineland stag-
gering with prohibited arms, and Japan
howling for a "just" and prompt solution
of the Davao question. We are glad be¬
cause, in a way, it is good for the health.
You have to be tough in a tough neigh-
borhood or every tough around pulls your
nose. China should be thankful she has
been getting a lot of tweaking in the nose
from Japan. China is even now practis¬
ing bombing on ¡Chinese Reds, and you
just watch when Chinese aviators perfect
their aims.
ND what do you think the thousands
A of maestros who got their di¬
plomas last week as military instructors
in schools underwent a month of military
training for? Manila graduated her
contingent last week, and maybe you
would want to see just how they look like.
Turn to page 4. Incidentally, a teacher¬
trainee offers some important suggestions
about getting the most out of the effort
and money spent in training 3,500 teach-
ers to be school military instructors.
W OU will remember that national de-
l fense is one of the President’s big
passions, but we understand that he is
developing another one: yachting. You
will know just how keen we are about
this, page 6, and on page 8, you will get
convinced the Chief loves yachting, only
he used the s.s. President Coolidge for a
cruise to China in the company of High
Commissioner Murphy who is rushing
home to save Michigan for President
Roosevelt, and to take up U. S.-P. I. eco¬
nomic problems if he has time.
vv'HICH reminds us of our heroic ef¬
Wforts to get the nation economic-
minded. Chromite, fish, mushroom, Pan¬
gasinan tenants (pages 9, 16, 21, and 15),
this week’s economic dish, and don’t tell
us Sec. Quirino who wants all employees
under his department to raise food crops
is our inspiration.
S to our inspiration for the article on
A page 10: A. C. Anden read some¬
where of a debate on whether or not
books corrupt and immediately localized
it. Two people who agreed to write on
the subject A. C. A., subsequently, could
not locate, but Dr. Gilbert S. Perez said
it was one subject on which he had long
wanted to unburden himself and A. C. A.’s
idea, at least half of it, was saved. And
inasmuch as we are on the subject of
books, we would like to remind you that
A. E. Litiatco (remember this guv?) has
the second part of his article: What Our
Writers Read, page 12. Page 13 is A. E. L.
all over. When it comes to books you
can’t beat him, and he says so.
UT let us turn away from books and
P
3 tackle something that is more prac-
tical in the sense that when we get into
trouble the article on page 14 would be
of more immediate help than the subjcct
of what books to read. If you have heard
of the probation law, do not be misled
into surprising, say, the fair but adamant

THE SPOTLIGHT


one from behind in the belief that the
probation law will necessarily come to
your rescue. There are many ifs attached
to this probation thing and we suggest
you get thoroughly informed about
FrHIS week’s local short
 story is The Little
Children by Estrella D.
Alfon. You will not shed
tears reading this, al¬
though we are not sure of
that, as many did over
Miss Alfon’s Home Be¬
fore the Journey. We
wish we had. the training
to get into verbal hyste¬
rics over this story. It is E. D. Alfon
that good, really. And if
you are wondering how Miss Alfon can
give the atmosphere peculiar to her stories
here is the secret: "I’ve learned (don’t tell
A. E. about this, or he’ll blush to the roots
of his hair) that writing a story as
though I talk to a rerson makes the thing
quite easy. I have, in my two last stories,
always pretended I talked to A. E. You
see, the way he comments and tells me
about my own works, makes him just the
person I would like to talk to. Seeing that
I really cannot talk to A. E., I have, in¬
stead, to talk to myself. I listen to my
own voice, and the words I speak. And
after I’ve got the right words, I type them
down.” (As to A. E.’s blushing, Miss Al¬
fon, we have been working with him for
something like half a dozen years and we
have yet to sce him do that even before
dishes of applesauce.)
rrHE cover painting
 depicts a scene
A. E. L. ought to be very
familiar with by now—
he has been there long
enough, we mean in Ba¬
guio, to know his pine
trees, if not Igorot girls.
Aside from the artistic
ability of the painter, Mr.
Marcelino R. Rivera, it
M. R. Rivera is obvious the gentleman
has a sense of humor.
Imagine submitting this cover to us
when thermometers in Manila reg¬
istered 95 degrees in the shade and
we were ready to swear it was at
least 195! You will remember Mr. Ri¬
vera’s country lass with the water jar
( , February 20th), not only for
the truly sylvan scene depicted but for
the fact that for once, a local painter had
the sense to paint a country beauty with
a whole (not broken) jar.
If you have already forgotten, Mr.
Rivera is a son of Malabon, Rizal, and the
U. P. School of Fine Arts is his Alma
Mater.


coming issues
r E have received a number of inqui¬
ries concerning the legality of va¬
rious schemes to make a lot of mo¬
ney: mutual aid associations, contests,
chain-letters. The inquirers, we take it,
do not want to part with their money un¬
til they are sure these schemes are not
rackets. We went to see the authorities
and we are sure you will be as surprised
as we were at the things we found, You
will read about them next week.

Hard Work Ahead


N the 16th of next month, the Assembly will open for
O work with problems not only of vast importance bat
needing immediate solution awaiting the assemblymen.
No other group of local legislators ever had to face more
serious matters than those confronting the first assembly
of lawmakers under the Commonwealth. For theirs is a
great deal of foundation work: the laying out of a solid,
broad base for the Commonwealth within the limits pro¬
vided in the Constitution.
The economic problems, of course, are of first importance:
the Commonwealth will succeed or flounder, depending upon the
way the economic questions are treated. Involved in these ques¬
tions are necessary adjustments in U. S.-P. I. trade relations; the
partial industrialization of the country with a view to producing
locally most of the products we import at present; the settlement
of our vast, fertile, uncultivated tracts of land which in their pre¬
sent state aliens covet and are thus a source of danger; spurring on
nationals to strive for more participation in commercial under¬
takings; conservation and development of the natural resources


so as to give the utmost benefits to the nation; and other equally
important economic puzzles like increasing the tax revenues with-
out making taxation onerous and the construction of needed high-
ways or railroads when funds are short.

There, also, is the need for an educational overhaul to
obtain better results from the money being invested in
education. There are the Mindanao problems, including
the ticklish Davao question, all so important that no less
than the President suggested a special legislative inves¬
tigation of the matter.
All this is just a glimpse of the magnitude of the work ahead
for legislators. Not one of their problems is unsolvab'e, it is true,
but these problems, if the best solutions are the object, will tax
to the limit not only the collective and individual abi'ities of law¬
makers but their patriotism. Whether the ability and the patrio¬
tism are extant in the national lawmaking body, the results in
this coming legislative session will amply show.

cently, under the leadership of Cap-
tain T. M. Calleja of the motor
vessel Governor Taft, the Bicolano
Gocdwill Tourist Party was organ¬
ized, and it left Legaspi, Albay, for
the South last April 28th.
The party visited important
towns in the Visayas such as Cat-
balogan (Samar), Baco od (Occ.

attend the carnival in Cebu.

There were more women than
men in the Bicol Goodwill Tourist

that women here are more travel¬

FrWO steps nearer President
Quezon’s pet dream of es¬
tablishing a citizen army
here were made last Friday, May
15th, when the 20-year-old boys
who will undergo the 5-1-month
trainee instruction in 1937 were
picked out, and the teacher-trai¬
nees who took the prescribed 30-
day course in military tactics gra¬
duated, ready to teach the school
children next June.
Drawn By Lot
As provided in the National De-
fense Law, the selection of young
men who will train next year was

done by lot publicly. The law does
not define who should draw the
counterfoils containing the serial
numbers of the registrants, and so
girls were put on the job, the idea
perhaps borrowed from the national
charity sweepstakes. Or maybe it
was prompted by the same thought
which led to the printing of the
much-lambasted “This - Or - That'
posters aimed at prodding the
young men to enlist. In either case,
the feminine touch was not out of
place.
The girls presented a resem¬
blance to Bind Justice, as they
were blindfolded with thick white
gauze when they drew the lots: no-


thing was spared to make the pro¬
cess above suspicion. In the pro¬
vinces a board composed of the pro¬
vincial governor, the provincial fis¬
cal, and the provincial military
commander was present in the
drawings; in Manila and Baguio
the board was composed of the city
mayor, the city fiscal, and an of-
ficer of the Philippine Army cho¬
sen by the provost marshal general.
Drawings
Prompt'y at half past eight in
the morning, the drawing began in
Manila. Mayor Posadas, City Fis¬
cal Gervacio Diaz, Captain Jose P.
Guido, Chief of Police Antonio


Torres, Captain Manuel Argonza,
City Engineer Artiaga, and several
policemen were present inside the
enclosure where the drawing was
made, at the Araullo High School.
Outside the enclosure sat scores
of 20-year-old youths who could not
wait for the papers to announce the
names of those chosen.
The whole day before the draw-
ing was spent in checking the coun¬
terfoi's and placing them in sepa¬
rate boxes: the Group A box for
those who completed and who will
complete their 20th year before
July 1, 1936; the other for those
who will be twenty after that date
up to December 31st. This job was
supervised by Mayor Posadas, City
Fiscal Diaz, Chief Torres, Captain
Guido, and Captain Argonza.
Two girls drew the lots at the
same time, one from box A, the
other from box B. The first num-
ber drawn from box A was 5565,
corresponding to the serial number
of Marcelino Dimacali; that from
box B was 5251, corresponding to
the serial number of Manuel Tim-
breza.
Three recorders, one of them a
policeman, seated at a near-by
table, record the numbers. The two
girls were replaced by another set
after 1 hour, and so on after every
hour.
Only Half To Train
In Manila, out of the 7,012 who
registered, the names of 1,884 from
box A were drawn, while the same
number was drawn from box B.
The number of names drawn from
each box is twice the number of
those who will actually train, to


May 21, 1936

The drawing of Jots to decide who of the 20-year-olds of Manila are to undergo trainee instruction next year mas held in the
presence of (left to right) Fiscal Diaz, Mayor Posadas,, Cuptain Jase P. Guido, and Police Chief Torres. The numbers were
drawn by blindfolded sirls, alsa shown above.


give allowance for those who may
be given deferments, exempted for
physical reasons, or those who fail
to report on time. That means to
say, le of those whose names were
drawn from box A will train begin¬
ning January 1, 1937, while 12 of
those whose names were taken from
box B will start training on July
1, 1937.
The 20-year-olds who registered
in the entire Is ands last April 7th
numbered 148,964. Out of these
80,000 names were drawn last Fri¬
day, 40,000 under age-group A, and
the same number for age-group B.
Actually there will be only 20,000
young men who will receive trainee
instruction beginning next January
1st.
Eagerly Await Their Numbers
So eager were the young men in
Manila to be chosen that they
crowded near the enclosure where
the lots were being drawn, the bet-
ter to hear their numbers called. A,
young man in shirts'eeves nearly
jumped up with glee when his num-
ber was called. Another, upon hear¬
ing a number of a friend called, re¬
marked: “Lucky, that fellow.” One
began to worry when the numbers
around his were being announced,
but not his.
Probably it was the novelty of
the thing, the distinction of being
among the first bunch to train,
that made the boys so enthusiastic.
Maybe it was simply the love of
soldiering.
Three Thousand Five Hundred
Graduate
Last Friday night 3,500 teacher¬
trainees from all parts of the coun¬
try received their diplomas after
training for 30 days. The around
140 in Manila impressed General
Santos with their precision in close
order drill when he reviewed them
a day before their graduation.

during their graduation exercises
at the Gagalangin barracks.
Without receiving any compensa¬
tion, except their subsistence and
lodging, these teachers submitted
to the grueling training and sur¬
prised themselves with the amount


of military knowledge they could
cram in during those 30 days.
Verily, the sum of around P2,625
spent daily by the government for
the maintenance and subsistence of
these teacher-trainees has been
more than repaid.


Wasted Training?
However, “Teacher-Trainee No.
81" of La Paz, Iloilo, thinks that
the huge sum the government has
spent will be so much waste of mo¬
ney unless these teacher-trainees
are given the necessary facilities to
enable them to effectively transmit
what they have learned to their pu¬
pils.
To bring this about, according to
“Teacher-Trainee No. 81” who has
been a military instructor in a high
schoo! for 5 years, military instruc¬
tion in our schools must be a sepa¬
rate and distinct subject, or must
be a prerequisite for promotion as
is being done in the U.P. and in
some private colleges; it must be
placed under the supervision of
trained teachers who should devote
all their time to military drill; it
must be given sufficient funds.
Teacher-trainees must wear milita¬
ry uniforms to get the proper res¬
pect due them, and must be address¬
ed accordingly.

President Manuel L. Quezon: wears a

INCE the appearance of
O'Brien’s article in the “Re¬
O view of Reviews" and Manly’s
in the “Chicago Tribune," no other
article dealing with the P. I. has
drawn as much comment here as the
short Associated Press dispatch
from the United States, received
here last week:
"Washington, May 12.—Quintin
Paredes, Philippine resident com¬
missioner in the United States,
disclosed to-day that President
Manuel L. Quezon, of the Com¬
monwealth, is considering the
purchase of an official yacht.
"At President Quezon’s request
the commissioner has inquired
about the steam yacht Casiana,

of Los Angeles, once the property
of the late E. L. Doheny, oil mag¬
nate. Other inquiries have been
made regarding the Southern
Cross at Bermuda.
Unlike the O'Brien and the Man¬
ly articles, there was nothing of¬
fensive in the news report; neither
was there anything in it to reflect
upon the good name of the Filipino
people. Indeed, the story might
even make American readers be¬
lieve that we have become signifi¬
cantly prosperous.
Reactions
Quite expected'y, however, reac¬
tion to the report has been sharp
and prompt. The austere Tribune
“This govern¬
asked edicorially;
ment is too poor to provide its
chief executive with that luxury.
A yacht is expensive both as to its
original cost and to its upkeep...
This is the reason why it has been
husbanding its resources. How
should one square this with a
luxury that is a yacht?”
But more stinging were the re-
marks made by taxpayers. “Unne¬
cessary waste of public money,” re¬
marked one official in a whisper,
looking around to be sure nobody
else was within hearing distance.
Our coffers, he said, cannot stand
further inroads, especially for un¬

during inspection tours.


reasonable purposes.
"A presidential yacht is a’l right,
even fitting, for executives and
kings of other countries. But cer¬
tainly not for the President of the
Philippines," put in an assembly-
man from a near-by province.
would fight the idea if the question
is placed before the National As¬
sembly.”
Reason Behind Purchase
But this assemblyman will pro¬
bably change his mind, for a for¬
mer colleague of his, Serafin Mara¬
but, upon whose hefty shou ders
rests the task of cutting loose unes¬
sential services in the government


with the end in view of making our
government one of the "simplest
and cheapest in the Far East," has
come out in the defense of the mas¬
ter with a correction of the Paredes
Washington tale. In the absence of
President Quezon, who could nei¬
ther confirm nor deny the Paredes
story, Marabut, playing the role of
Malacanang spokesman, admitted
that the plan to purchase the
yacht is true but this yacht—either
the Southern Cross or the Casiana
—will not serve as a presidential
yacht but wil be placed in the
general service of the national gov¬
ernment like any ship of the gov-
ernment. The same clarification,
in effect, was advanced by Secret¬
ary Vargas.
Was Paredes Misinformed?
From the Malacanang spokes¬
men’s statement of clarification,
one may deduce that Commissioner
Paredes was either misquoted or
plainly lying. The opinion among
Ayuntamiento officials that he in¬
advertently let loose a "state secret”
prevailed, however. It was the opi¬


nion last week that Paredes had
talked too prematurely.
It was explained that the Pres-
ident, upon being apprised of the
very heavy yearly expense for the
maintenance of the s.s. Bustamante
due to her old age, requested Philip-
pine Resident Commissioner Pare¬
des to make inquiries as to the pos¬
sibilities of acquiring another
boat.
Nevertheless, official communica¬
tions on the subject and a series of
previous incidents point to the de¬
sire of President Quezon to have at
least one government boat at his
disposal for inter-island inspection
trips.


Behind the cabled request that
Commissioner Paredes look into the
possibility of purchasing a new
government vessel, two significant
incidents appear to be of consider¬
able interest.
New Vessel Needed
The first occurred during one of
the inspection trips of President
Quezon to the South. The Pres¬
ident, displeased with the inade¬

quate facilities of the boat he had
taken, ill-humoredly announced that
he would have one for the exclusive
use of Malacanang. Because the
government coastguard cutter Ara¬
yat has to do some patrol work in
Philippine waters, and because in¬
ter-island steamers operated by pri¬
vate companies have definite iti¬
neraries, President Quezon fre¬
quently finds much inconvenience in
using both for his frequent inspec¬
tion trips.
The second incident devolves
upon the use of the Arayat. Last
April, the question was placed be¬
fore customs officials that only one
vessel, the Arayat, was doing patrol
work. One government cutter, the
Mindoro, has been laid up for the
last four years for lack of funds to
maintain it. But the Arayat, since
the early part of this year, has been
placed at the disposal of President
Quezon and has virtua’ly been con¬
verted into a presidential yacht.
For this reason, the Philippine wa¬
ters, especially those in the southern
islands, were practically left un¬
guarded. It was discovered that
smugglers of Chinese immigrants
and prohibited drugs were particu¬
larly active in the southern waters,
taking advantage of the opportun¬
ity offered by the absence of patrol
vessels. Customs laws, according to
reports, had been ruth'essly violat¬
ed by vessels engaged in smuggling
between the ports of Borneo and
Cagayan de Sulu and Balabac. For
this reason, in 1934, when the Ara¬
yat was still doing patrol work,
sixteen vessels of domestic owner¬
ship were found violating customs
laws and fined. Since the begin¬
ning of this year, not a single ves¬
sel has been apprehended for simi¬
lar crimes.
Overhaul Bustamante
These things considered, customs

officia’s looked into the possibility
of overhauling the Bustamante and
of placing this vessel at the dis¬
posal of President Quezon. The
Arayat would thereby be placed on
the regular run once more.
Whether the President objected


to making the Bustamante, an old
vessel as the flagship of the minia¬
ture Philippine navy, and as his of-
ficial yacht, is not known. What is
known is that he caused a cable to
be sent to Resident Commissioner
Paredes, asking him to inquire into


the possibility of acquiring another
vesse'. Commissioner Paredes, com¬
plying with the instruction from
Manila, inquired about the steam
yacht Casiana and the Southern
Cross. The amount of P150,000 was
asked for the Casiana and P1,000,-


000 for the Southern Cross.
Costly to Operate
Steam yachts and coastguard
cutters are costly to operate. The
Bazahaw now used by the bureau
of commerce, the Kanlaon, Busta¬


mante, and Mindoro were placed in
the drydocks a few years ago as no
funds for their operation were
made by the legislature.
The Arayat, the only coastguard
cutter now being operated by the
bureau of customs, is costing the
government no less than P123,000 a
year. For its maintenance, upkeep,
and crew, the government paid
₱123,952.00 in 1935. On the other
hand the Bustamante cost the gov-
ernment P150,000 a year when it
was in operation. The Apo, the
Phi ippine gubernatorial yacht,
was turned over to the U.S. Army
a few years ago because it, too, was
using up government money at the
rate of P150,000 annually.
The claim has been advanced by
Malacanang spokesmen that it
would be cheaper to purchase the
Casiana than to overhaul the Busta¬
mante. However, those familiar
with steam vessels, and those who
know the type of the steam yacht
Casiana, maintain that while the

Quezon Regrets Departure
President Quezon deeply regret¬
ted that High Commissioner Mur¬
phy had to leave the Islands. In his
very words, he voiced the reason
for his regret: “I fear that with
a High Commissioner lacking in a
large vision and true statesmanship,
the whole purpose of the Indepen¬
dence Act may be, if not complete¬


ly, defeated, at least so seriously
jeopardized as to make its achieve¬
ment difficult. The tact, wisdom,
and statesmanship of High Com-
missioner Murphy have made the
position of the High Commissioner
one of great usefulness and help to
the Philippines; ...... We feel that
we are partners, that what will
make a success for the High Com¬
missioner will also make a success
for the President of the Philip-
pines, and that what will be a cre-
dit for the government of the Com-
monwealth will also be a credit to
the High Commissioner..."

YO, there is no end to the
variety of minerals in the
A ( Philippines which can be or
are being profitably exploited. We
have producing gold mines in the
northern Luzon regions, a rich
iron ore mine in Camarines Nor¬
te, rock asphalt and marb'e de¬
posits in the Visayas. But it re¬
mains for the mountains of Zam¬
bales province, particularly around
the municipalities of Santa Cruz,
Candelaria, and Masinloc, to offer
high-grade chromite ores.
About twelve kilometers east of
Barrio Lucapon in the municipa'ity
of Santa Cruz, Zamabales, lie 1,098
hectares of chromite mining claims
owned by the Luzon Consolidated
Mines Company, Inc. In Candela¬
ria, the Insular Chromite Reserva¬
tions are situated, while in Masin¬
loc may be found the United States
Chromite Reservations. Of all
these deposits, as verified by relia¬
be geologists, the 122 claims of the
Luzon Consolidated Mines are con¬
sidered the best.
They require
only a little exploration, develop-
ment, and proper exploitation.
Accessible
Thick bushes and giant trees
cover most of these chromite claims.
Valuable hard-wood timber also
covers the mountain sides.
From Manila, there are two ways
of reaching these mining deposits
over first c'ass roads. One is by
way of Bataan province and Olon¬
gapo, Zambales; the other is by
way of Tarlac and Pangasinan
provinces. By traveling over a
distance of 287 kilometers one
reaches Barrio Lucapon. From this
place there is a first class road
built by the Luzon Consolidated
Mines Company to its mining loca¬
tion.
After winding your way through
dense growth of giant trees, you
come to the workers’ village. There
are, from here, several trails lead¬
ing to the different mineral depos¬

In the village there are several
thousand tons of chromite ore
deposited in open bodegas. The ore

Lack of money for books one
wishes to read is not the only
problem of the book lover. For
even if he had all the money he
needed for all the books he wanted
to possess, he could buy and
possess only those books the cen¬
sors say are good for him to read.
There is need to protect adoles¬

should any kind of book be with-

The following article attempts
to answer this question. It ought
to be interesting to censors.
AN a book corrupt a person?
This is a question that can¬
O not be answered unless we
define the word “corrupt.” If by
corruption we mean a change of
view point then we may emphatic-
ally state that the reading of certain
books may corrupt an individual. In
the ear'y part of the last century
the corporations which were for
the most part ardent royalists and
faithful subjects of His Spanish
Majesty believed that the inscrip-
tions on the coins of the recently
liberated South American republics
were demoralizing to the morale
and to the patriotism of Spain’s far
eastern colony. They believe that
such inscriptions as "Libre por la
Constitucion,” "Fiel y Firme por la
Union.” “Union Y Fuerza,” “Repu¬
blica Peruans" and other equally in¬
siduous and corrupting propaganda
"wou'd sooner or later undermine
the traditional loyalty of the Indio."
So they petitioned to the govern-
ment and asked that no coins from
these countries be permitted to cir¬
culate in the Islands. However,
crass materialism and a hungry sto¬
mach had to be appeased. Unfor¬
tunately, these South American
states were the only countries from
which the Philippines could pur¬
chase silver for the commerce of
the country. So they compromised.
A royal edict was issued and a steel
die made that would absolutely dis¬
figure these coins and erase these
most “b'asphemous, anarchistic and
unpatriotic inscriptions.” As the
good fathers soon realized that the
fact that these colonies were now
free and independent could not be
concealed indefinitely the censoring
and counterstamping of these coins

was discontinued in 1836. These
coins are now the most interesting
and expensive specimen in Philip-
pine Numismatics.
In an absolute monarchy, Patrick
Henry’s speech would be considered
most corrupting. In a Soviet coun¬
try all books attacking the commu¬
nist regime would be immediately
censored. In a conservative repub¬
lican country, Karl Marx’s “Capi¬
tal" would undergo the same fate.
Because of differences in religious
thought in different states, Gibbon’s
"Faith of our Fathers,” “The Book
of Mormon,” Paine’s "Age of Rea¬
son,” Fox’s “Book of Martyrs,”"
“The Koran,” Darwin’s "Origin of
Species," and even the Bib’e would
be considered most corrupting to
the existing religious morale of the
youth of the country. In a country
noted for prudery, Balzac’s “Tales,”
Boccaccio's "Decameron,” Marlowe’s
“Hero and Leander,” Friar Rabe¬
lais' "Gargantua and Pentagruel,"
and an annotated and explained edi¬
tion of "King Solomon’s Songs”
would be placed on a bonfire. In
a country where ignorance of sex
and sex hygiene is colossal, all books
or magazines on this subject would
be immediate'y censored.
However, in countries where edu¬
cation and progress and where cul¬
ture and freedom have developed a
citizenship that thinks for itself
and that does not have to have some¬

one else to do their thinking for
them, there would be no censorship
of any of these books. There would
be no need to censor them because
those who would read the books
would have a mind of their own
and it would be impossible to cor¬
rupt them.
It is true that some of the books
would be kept away from the youth
of the country who may be too im¬
mature in mind to read them intel¬
ligently but none of the books would
be kept from the library shelves of
scholars, thinkers, and of mentally
matured citizens. In some progres¬
sive countries a large number of
books are kept away from the book¬
stacks of Juvenile libraries, but all
of the inhabitants of the country
are not reduced to a state of unde¬
veloped ado escence by censoring all
books which might corrupt imma¬
ture and youthful readers.
We should have enough confi¬
dence in the Presidents of our uni¬
versities, in librarians of national
and university libraries, professors
and scientists in our colleges, pro¬
fessional men and mature scholars
and book lovers to enable them to
purchase whatever book they would
like to obtain without placing upon
them the same restrictions which we
would place upon a group of ado¬
lescent schoo boys and convent
school girls. If they are not worthy
of that confidence they should not
be permitted to occupy either their
posts or their standing in the com-
munity. How can legislators talk

gently upon certain questions if all
literature on those subjects are
banned by over zealous censors?
The way of the censor is strange
and of the censoress passing
strange. With a fig-leaf attitude to
wards books, statues and paintings,
they will go through a book store
or newsstand and purge it of all
books having on their cover a Ve¬
nus de Milo or a trouserless boar,
but after they have gotten through
with their job one could go through
the same store and find scores of
books which are far more anti-socia
and demoralizing to youth and to
the civic welfare of the country
than those magazines which tell the
young people, in a decent manner,
the things which the young people
of yesterday had to learn in the
mire of the gutter and from dep¬
raved companions. The publishers
of anti-social books, however, do
not believe in illustrations. They
cover their pamphlets with simple
covers and as the censors are handi¬
capped by a one-track obsession
these books remain on the shelves.
These comments do not refer to
any special country or any special
group of censors. Some have used


their discretionary powers well—
others have leaned backwards in
the wrong direction.
A great furor was raised when
the novel “Ulysses” was censored
by several countries. I was very
much interested and wanted to see
a copy of the book. When the cen¬
sorship was removed and I was able
to get it, I was surprised to find
that that voluminous tome could be
placed within reach of any high
school boy and within the reach of
many college Freshmen and Sopho¬
mores and a large number of college
seniors without corrupting them in
the least. Few of them would be
able to wade through the many
chapters and few or none of them
would understand them even if
they had the patience to wade
through all of them. But “Ulysses"
was expressly written for mature
minds.
Books can corrupt undeveloped
minds. As the minds of the young
are still in the process of deve op
ment and as young people are pro¬
verbially impressionable, at that
age it may be more than wise to li¬
mit their literary menu but it
would not be to the credit of a

culation at the U. P. library.


country to admit that so many of
its adults were still in the undeve¬
loped adolescent stage that meas¬
ures would have to be taken to pro¬
hibit the circulation of books which
circulate freely in countries which
have reached a stage of mental ma¬
turity and of independent thinking.
There are stories and magazines
which glorify crime and criminals.
They make heroes of them and place
a crown on the brow of the gang¬
ster and a halo around the head of
the racketeer. They make them end
their careers without paying the
debt which they owe to humanity
because of their continued and per¬
nicious anti-social attitudes. That
type of literature escapes the cen¬
sor because some censors cannot
obtain vicarious enjoyment in read¬
ing them and in suppressing them.
Yet they are the very type of books
and magazines which have led
the greatest number of our
young people on the road to crime;
a far greater number than have
been led astray by those ma¬
gazines which treat of a subject
which could always be learned by
young people long before the first
book was ever published. We can¬
not keep the young people in igno¬
rance of sex because sex is all
around them, but we can keep them
away from certain anti-social ten¬
dencies because these ideas propa¬
gate themselves almost exclusively
from the written page and from
soap box oratory. There may be
some sex books which are vicious
but a sex book or magazine should
not be censored merely because it
refers to sex.
Books can corrupt the immature
and the mentally undeveloped, but
no book, it does not matter how vi¬
cious it might be, can corrupt men
or women who have minds of their
own and who do their own thinking.
In a recent trip to Europe, I made
the acquaintance of a very interest-
ing greup of young Irish Jesuit
priests. I was amazed at their fa¬
miliarity with the best books which
have been written for and against

tioned this to one of them he replied,
“We do not have these books on
the shelves of our colleges for
young people, but all of us have ac¬
cess to them because we believe
that we cannot successfully and ef-
ficiently combat something about
which we know absolutely nothing."
There is a need in every country
for an intelligent and a cultured
censorship; -a censorship that has a
sense of relative values; a censor¬
ship that will not bite at a gnat
and swallow an elephant.
One must not imagine that all
conservative thought is related to
social betterment or that all liberal
thought is anti-social. Many crimes
have been perpetrated in the name
of liberalism and many a conserva¬
tive, sacrosanct doctrine may also
conceal hidden cesspolls of social in¬
justice. The ignorant mass-mind
does not reason—it only believes,
and the most erroneous (I do not
say radical or conservative) beliefs
instigate mass psychology which

of the gentlemen....
ALVADOR P. LOPEZ, column¬
ist and associate literary editor
of the Herald and managing editor of
the Commonwealth Advocate, writes
poems, stories, reviews, and essays.
His Roll of Honor is composed of:
“John Ruskin—for his mastery of
the language and for his heart that
was good.
“Bertrand Russell—for his fresh,
courageous insight, for a style
which makes clear the most ab¬
struse of philosophies.
“Branch Cabell—for his naughty
whimsicalities, his flawless style,
for recreating romance.
"H. L. Mencken—for his courage,
his gift of epithet, his ability to
damn and damn well.
"Walt Whitman—for his forth¬
right verse and the resonance of
his lines.
“John Keats—for pure, unalloyed
poetry.

“Feodor Dostoievsky—for the

which like “Crime and Punishment"
I have actually finished and en¬

“Christopher Morley—for the

comes with a surprise and makes
one say, 'Why didn’t I use that be¬

“Joseph Hergesheimer—because
he has a gift of character analysis,


Manuel E. Arguilla, one of our best
short-story writers: has a great variety
of favorite authors.
and because he writes a cadenced

thing I myself fancy.
"Aldous Huxley—for "Point
Counter Point’ and his stories, for
his frankness and honesty, and for
his smooth, brittle heresy of the
liberated intellectual.
“Bernard S h a w—because he
thinks he is greater than Shakes¬
peare, and because he is one of
those rare writers who can embody
the sublimest truth in the lightest
of pleasantries.
"Edna St. Vincent Millay—be¬
cause I like her sonnets, because I


think she is far more passionate
and a greater poet than Mrs.
Browning.
“Rupert B r o o k e—because he
wrote such joyful and vital poetry,
full of the jote the vivre, and be¬
cause he was handsome and died
young.
“Thomas Hardy—because he is
dark, deep, and doomful (shades
of Liberty!), because his poetry is
full of fate and the tyranny of cir¬
cumstance, because he wears the
ironic smile gently yet like a true¬
born physician of mankind."
Y YARCISO G. REYES, former
4 ( editor of The Quill and now
with The Philippines Commonweal,
is perhaps the most significant of
the Veronicans to date and one of
our most versatile writers: stories,
essays, plays, poems, and what-nots
have flowed from his pen. He
says: “I doubt if I can help you
as much as I would wish. I have
such few favorites: Hilaire Belloc,
Max Beerbohm, Rupert Brooke,
Stephen Leacock, Sigrid Undset,
John Galsworthy, Willa Cather,
Shelley, Francis Thompson, Emily
Dickinson, and Edna St. Vincent
Millay—and why they are my
favorites only God knows."”
NONRADO S. RAMIREZ is one

writes stories once in a while. He
classifies his favorite authors thus:

 N last week’s issue and in this,
you will have seen a number
of our leading writers naming
their favorite authors. At the risk
of exalting myself by implication,
I shall not resist the itch to join
the fun.
But first, what do I consider my
favorite authors? Are they those
whom I respect or admire? Not
necessarily. There is no critic
whose views I respect more than
those of Brother Leo. And the
critic in me admires the technique
of Kipling, Wilbur Daniel Steele,
Ring Lardner, Edna Ferber, O.
Henry, Ibsen, O'Neil', Wells, and
many others, in their better mo¬
ments. But none of them is my
favorite.
Is it the writers who have never
quite disappointed me? No. For
I could say that of Willa Cather,
Galsworthy, Chekhov, Anatole
France, Cabell, Edith Wharton,
Dickens, Thackeray, Jane Austen,
Thomas Mann, H. E. Bates, L. A. G.
Strong, etc. But none of them is
my favorite.
Is it the authors who have influ¬
enced me somehow or other at one
time or another? No.. Christopher
Morley, Katharine Brush, Gorky,
Kisfaludi, Wilde, F. Scott Fitzge¬
rald, Dorothy Parker, et al have
left their impress, temporary or
permanent, on me. But none of
them is my favorite.
Is it the scribes whom I am moved
to imitate? No. As a columnist, I
should like to be as satirical as J. B.
Morton or as entertaining as Alex¬
ander Woollcott. As a story-teller,
I would not object to writing like
Katherine Mansfield, Pirandello,
Liam O'Faherty, Andreyev, Callag¬
han, Maupassant, Remarque, Sher¬
wood Anderson—the Sherwood An¬
derson, at any rate, who wrote “I
Want to Know Why” and “The
Strength of God,” “The Triumph
of the Egg" and "Im a Fool.” But
none of them is my favorite.


field—Old-fashioned, substantial
poetry is his forte. A master of
classical proportions. His lines are
like 'those slow, old tunes of Spain."
Aldous Hucley—His treatment of
the Leda legend is peerless, espe¬
cially at the end where he describes
very aptly the feelings of his sub-
jects. Paul Valery—For poetry
that is strange and sweet. Fyodor
Sologub—There is beauty, and the
pain that goes with true beauty, in
his lines replete with that fatalis¬
tic realism that only one who has
suffered deeply can understand.
"AE' -(George William Russell)—
(Contired on page 44)


Is it the pen-wielders whose
works I never let pass when they
come my way? No. Somehow,
am always attracted by the book
reviews of Clifton Fadiman and
the comments on plays of George
Jean Nathan. Whenever I see the
column of Westbrook Pegler or of
Howard Brubaker, I never skip it...
But none of them is my favorite.
Is it the “brain parents” of fav¬
orite essays, poems, plays, stories,
and novels of mine? No. "Of Hu¬
man Bondage” by W Somerset
Maugham is one of the best novels
I have ever read; “Bill’s Little
Gir.” by Zona Gale, one of the best
stories; and "A Bouquet for Jenny
by Joyce Kilmer the best familiar
essay. But neither Miss Gale,
Maugham, nor Kilmer is a favorite
of mine.
What, then, do I consider a fav.


orite writer? One who is all those
—and more. That is, one who has
not only won my respect and admi¬
ration, never quite disappointed me,
influenced me somehow at one time
or another, moved me to follow in
his footsteps, won me into missing
none of his works, and written fav¬
orite pieces of mine, but who has
become so close to me, so associated
with sources of happiness, that I
have come to feel a certain affec-
tion for him which has nothing to do
with a pigeon-holed because of this,
that, or the other. These, in other
words: G. K. Chesterton, J. M.
Barrie, Elizabeth Barrett Brown-
ing, Dorothy Thomas, Edna St. Vin¬
cent Milay, Jerome K. Jerome,
George Bernard Shaw, H. H. Mun¬
ro (Saki), Coventry Patmore, Ivan
Turgenev, Per Hallstrom, and Jef¬
fery Farnol.
This is all, except that, like Mrs.
Reyes, I feel that there are authors
who would be my favorites also if
only I had read more of their works.
This is true, for example, of Ferenc
Molnar and Rudolf Besier. The
latter wrote my favorite p'ay, “The
Barretts of Wimpole Street. But
I have read but one other play by
him—although that, too, is good.

and guests of the National Pro¬
bation and Paro'e Association
who honored him with a banquet
at the Manila Hotel, Monday noon,
May IIth, on the eve of his depart¬
ure for the United States.
“You have a great champion of
social justice in your midst,” he
continued, "and that champion is no
other than President Quezon who
cherishes in his heart great sympa¬
thy for the masses. Present your
problems to him, you who are in¬
terested in social work, and you
will find in him a great ally in your
endeavor to improve the lot of your
less fortunate countrymen."
“My idea of social justice,” he
went on, "is like a tree with many
branches, one of which is spread
over the lot of the destitute, the
poor, the helpless. That branch is
to give protection and aid, succor
and she ter against the ravages of
injustice. You have plenty of room
for social work in your beloved
isles. All you have to do is to bear
the burden and labor hard in its
accomplishment.”
The High Commissioner recount¬
ed his resolution in his early years
as judge of the Municipal Court of
Detroit, that if he should err in his
judgment in the cases before him,
he should err on the side of mercy.
The High Commissioner related
that when he was elected a judge
in Detroit, those who had anything
to do with probation were political


appointees. He introduced a reso¬
lution placing appointments on the
merit basis. In conjunction with
this, he advocated the establishment
of a psychiatric clinic for proba¬
tioners for the study of their here¬
dity and mentality on purely scien¬
tific basis.
As judge, the High Commis¬
sioner did not depend merely on his
judgment in deciding cases. He in¬
novated the novel idea of creating
what he calls a sentencing board
composed of the chief probation of-
ficer and the chief psychiatrist.
The matter is referred to them by
the presiding judge. The proba¬
tion officer de'ves into the social
history of the accused, his education
and ear'y life, his family and neigh-
borhood conditions, his habits and
associates, and his religious train¬
ing. The psychiatrist probes into
his heredity, his mentality, his
emotions, and beliefs.
On the basis of the findings, the
judge, the probation officer, and
the psychiatrist render judgment
on the case. The first considera¬
tion in their final judgment is
public interest, the second is the
interests of the accused. The High
Commissioner admits that this me¬
thod is one that he did not sponsor
in the Philippines, but he has high
hopes that in the future, when the
citizenry shall have been well in-
formed about social justice, that
this will be adopted in due time. In¬

COMPLAINTS OF PARII
TENANIS REVEAL
By PORFIRIO VIN. SISON


Department of Labor officials, tenants, and municipal officials of Rosales, Pangasinan, photagraphed after a meeting where the
tenants were allowed to voice their grievances. In the picture are Sec. Ramon Torres, Hilarion Silayan, ex-Rep. Domingo of Tar¬
lac, and athers.


(XACTLY what is the labor
situation in the province of
M Pangasinan? Why are farm
tenants there so restless that
authorities have to pacify them at
times to prevent their unrest from
developing into something more
serious? Are the landlords un¬
just in their treatment of farm
hands?
The vexing questions were an¬
swered by farm tenants and labor¬
ers of Pangasinan when a special
fact-finding committee of the De-
partment of Labor—composed of
Special Investigator Pablo Manlapit,
Public Defender Antonio Mejia,


cidentally, the judicial innovation
which he introduced died out soon
after he left the bench.
“You might encounter opposi¬
tions, criticisms, and reverses in
your fight for social justice but
keep up the good fight until you
attain your objectives. Probation
has to be understood thoroughly by
a well-meaning public, and once un¬
derstood it is there to stay. You
have all the necessary agencies to
make probation a success."
First Five Months of Probation
DULT probation is only five
months old in the Philippines
Aput they are five months of

and ten assistants—conducted pub¬
lic hearings in the province lasting
a whole month. Representative
agricu'tural towns, barrios, and
sitios were visited by the commit-
tee, and from all these places the
answers were surprisingly similar.
Many Injustices Bared
People in the remote barrios, ten¬
ants who dwell in frail nipa shacks,
welcomed the committee. The
meetings were organized with the
cooperation of the municipal of-
ficials. It was during these open
forum meetings that the tenants
made open their complaints and ex¬
posed the injustices being perpet¬
rated on them by their land ords.
The agrarian situation was found
acute in the towns of San Quintin,
Santa Maria, Umingan, Rosales,
and Santo Tomas, while San Car¬
los, Binmaley, and Lingayen, did not
have much to complain about. In
the former towns, the tenants claim
they are like slaves who work un¬
der any condition offered by land¬
lords.
As told to the investigators, they
were afraid to reason out with their
landlords lest the strips of land
they are now cultivating be taken
away from them.. Long hours at
manual labor are compensated with
ridiculously low wages.
Fines Imposed
The wages while unjustly small
are still made sma ler by the impo¬
sition of fines which scheming land-
lords resort to under flimsy excuses
and pretexts. The tenants cannot
borrow money from the landlords
without being charged exorbitant
rates of interest.
Two pernicious farm practices
were revealed to the committee:
the “canon," which is a system of
rents paid by the tenant to the land¬
lord, and the "posture," an entrance
fee paid by the laborers, before the
landlords will give them any kind


of work in the farm.
To Form Labor Societies
At one time, Secretary Ramon


Torres of Labor came down to
Pangasinan to pacify the laborers.
who demonstrated their discontent.
Mr. Torres counseled them to re¬
main calm, and promised them that
their rights would be protected by
the government.
It is said, after the completion
of the survey, that the committee
will suggest the organization of lab¬
or societies in the province. At
present there are only two such so¬
cieties, one in Umingan and another
in Tayug, both of which are inef-
fective. Labor leaders will also be
employed to guide the tenants, the
committee further pointed out.

one fishing ground where the Ja¬
panese have not gained consider¬
able foothold.
A couple of years ago, the
Japanese tried hard to cover the
northeastern portion of the island
of Bohol, using their modern fish-
ing methods, with the end in view
to taking from the hands of crafty
Boholanos the sizable returns of the
fishing industry in that region.
But it took the foreigners some
time to make adjustments that
would bring profits to their ven¬
ture, because the Bcholanos al¬
though using crude fishing imple¬
ments did not prove easy to defeat.
Rich Fishing Grounds
As it was then, the Japanese and
Boholano fishermen competed hard
along the northeastern portion of
Bohol which, dotted by tiny islands,
abounds with fishes of all kinds.
The Nipponese plowed the seas of
Bohol, while the natives confined
themselves mainly along the sea


not long after that, with the use
of a little “plain horse sense,” the
native fishermen also used lights,
so that at present the mainland of
Bohol can be seen dotted with
flickering lights at night coming
from alcohol fishing lamps of these
Bohol fishermen.
This modern method, so quickly
adopted by the Boholanos, requires
only a very simple contraption so
that it can be of great practical


places, she is the only island in the
Visayas which is no longer pestered
by the more crafty Japanese fisher¬
men.

coasts, and the day’s catch was al¬
ways brought to the markets of the
province of Cebu.
With the ready market and abun¬
dant fishing grounds, the Japanese
were then making Bohol one of
their permanent fishing sites.
However, the Boholano fishermen,
sensing that it would only be a
question of time before their means
of livelihood would be taken away
from them, adopted the Japanese
fishing methods.
Fishing With Lights
While still clinging to their old
fish corrals, the Boholanos careful¬
ly noted the successful results be¬
ing made by the Japanese through
the use of powerful lights. It was


use. The lighting apparatus is
hung at one end of the boat, and
two persons hold a net in readiness
near-by so that the net can be im
mediately thrown into the water
as scon as schools of fish attracted
by the light, swim close to the sur¬
face.
Natives in Full Control
Because of this change in fish-
ing methods, the Japanese fisher¬
men had been driven away from
the fishing grounds of Bohol.
Aside from this, the new impetn
being given by the fishermen
the industry has caused new co
munities to spring up along t.
coasts of the province. Just now,
Bohol is proud to boast that of all


making shipments to Japan, Ger¬
many, and the United States.
Shipments wi'l most likely start in
Juiy of this year.

and faith to those who were given
the responsibility to organize it.
Lacking in necessary facilities and
background for probation work, the
practice used in the United States
and in European countries had to
be utilized, modified, of course, to
suit local conditions. In this hard
task, the one man fitted for the
work, because of his deep humanity
and his interest in the downtrod¬
den and the oppressed, Judge Arse¬
nio C. Roldan, was appointed acting
chief of the probation office.
Forty-five cases of probation
have already been referred to the
probation office for study. Sixteen
of these cases have been favorably
acted upon and those involved are
now enjoying freedom under the
supervision of the probation office.
Nineteen persons were denied pro¬
bation because it was decided that
it would be to the best interest of
society to commit them to prison.
The remaining ten cases are await¬
ing the recommendation of the pro¬
bation officers designated to study
their cases.
How it Works
In the consideration of applica¬
tions for probation the would-be
probationer undergoes legal, social,
and personality tests on the result
of which the judge bases his deci¬
sion of any probation case.
In the legal test the offender’s
court record is examined, the nature
of the offense, and the version of
the complaining party. If the court
record reveals that he is a habitual
offender, he is denied probation
and is sentenced accordingly. Like¬
wise he is denied probation if the
offense is of the kind beyond pro¬
bationary treatment. Also, the com-
plainant is consulted since he is the
citizen whose rights have been vio¬
lated.
The social test embraces his edu¬
cation and early life, his family
and neighborhood conditions, em¬
ployment, recreation, habits and as¬
sociates, religious training, miti¬
gating and aggravating circum¬
stances that led to the commission
of the crime. This study is neces¬
sary in order to ascertain the na¬
ture of corrective treatment neces¬
sary.
The investigation concerning per¬
sonality involves determination of
his heredity, study of his physical
condition, state of his mentality, his
capacity, traits, and interests, his
emotions, sentiments, and beliefs,
his character and conduct, his man¬
ner and appearance, and all that
goes into the making of the person
who committed the crime. These
are necessary so that the offender
may be given the benefits of mod¬
ern scientific correctives.
The following cases will serve
as examp'es of the work the pro¬
bation office is accomplishing.
Abduction
Case No. 1. X is a young man
Hineteen years of age, a secondary


student in a recognized private
school with poor academic records
but of good behavior, a member of
a family of moderate means and
good reputation, with highly-edu¬
cated parents who have his inte¬
rests at heart and who can control
him. He eloped with his sweet¬
heart who was below eighteen years
of age, a girl of poor parents. The
youthful lovers are found the next
day after their elopement. X was
convicted of the crime of abduction
with consent.
Upon investigation, the probation
officer found that at the time of
the commission of the offense he
was enjoying great liberty at the
house of the offended party, and
that gave him the impression that
he could possibly do anything with-
out being held to account for it, and
that X was ignorant of the crimi¬
nal nature of the act of eloping
with a girl below eighteen years of
age even with her consent. X was
granted probation. Under proper
guidance and supervision, X com¬
pleted the secondary course with
good grades, came out successful¬
ly in the validating examination
given by the commissioner of pri¬
vate education, and is now taking
summer courses in the Far Eastern
University. He is well-behaved
both at home and in the office, at¬
tends Sunday School at the Central
Student Church, and has kept away
from bad company. He has paid
the sum of P1,000.00 to the offend-
ed party.


Trespass
Case No. 2. M is a dangerous
character convicted of the crime of
trespass. Probation wwas granted
him by the court. But now, as a
probationer, with the suspended
sentence dangling like a sword over
his head, ready to fa’l the moment
he makes any untoward act or re¬
vert to his old ways and with the
advice and guidance of a probation
officer, has mended his ways. He
no longer gets into brawls and is
more considerate to his wife and
children.
Case No. 3. A has been convicted
for theft. Now, he is paying back
the amount little by little. He is
an illiterate, but is learning how to
read and write. He has shown will-
ingness to reform. He is attend¬
ing mass every Sunday at the
Tondo Church and is highly prais¬
ed by the parish priest who sees to
it that he observes strict’y his reli¬
gious duties. His employer speaks
highly of his conduct. He seldom
goes to the movies and avoids con¬
sistently bad companies.
If the cases cited, as reported by
Atty. Hilario Bernardo and Atty.
Rafael David, Jr. of the probation
staff are indicative of effective in¬
dividual reform as accomplished by
the probation office, it is safe to
predict that probation work has
possibilities in this country. But
a friendly public is necessary to
realize fully these possibilities.

ORAEMAM
By ESTRELLA D. ALFON


yT is May. Little children pass
by the house, look longingly at
A the clusters of pink adelfas at
the door, then walk on. After a
while the same children pass by the
house again, look up with the same
longing, and again pass on.
My two brothers and a cousin are
gathered around a box, making
beastly noise with the round discs
they endeavor to shoot into one of
the four measured openings down
the end. Luz and Oscar kick each
other on the shins, disputing a turn
at shooting. And Firo shoots the
discs down the box with furious
clatter. Noise and shouting, and
the click of wooden dises hitting


each other.
I crowd myself into the dispute.
Settle it by shooting at the holes
myself. Now they are all against
me, but they either serve at the
holes and pile up the holed dises or
I gather them all inside and give
them errands to do.
The same little children pass by
the house again. It’s almost a play
now Shuffle by, look up at the
flowers, look at me, shuffle on
again. No, this time, they stop.
A little girl with chubby cheeks
and curled hair steps forward to
peer into the box. She looks at me
with big round eyes,. then glances
back at the four other children she
left on the side of the street. They
motion with shoulders and faces to
her, then look at the flowers.
Inday, give us some of your flow¬
ers, she manages to say at last. No
please, only the tone of the voice
suggests that. The two brothers
and Luz stop arguing and look at
the little girl who turns to face
them with a defensive pucker in
her mouth.
Grandmother’s face appears out
of a window, looks at the child and
inquires about her mission. Her
three grandchildren all answer her
at the same time. Grandmother
barks on order not to touch even
one of the flowers and withdraws


her head. The little girl frowns
frankly now at my brothers and
Luz, turns to me and explains it is
for the Flores. “But Grandmother
said no, child.” And the little girl
looks at the flowers, looks at her
four companions, then joins them
and together they walk away. A
short distance from us, they turn
their heads and fling a native word,
calling me selfish. My brothers
and Luz shakes their fists at them,
and fall to discussing the badness
of children who will not accept a
refusal for flowers gracefully.
We are tired of the game soon,
and we sit down at the edge of the
sidewa’k, Luz' dress and mine
wrapped around our legs so they
will not trail into the slime in the
ditch. We talk of former Mays
when I used to be in the Flores and
I was asking for flowers from
“selfish” people too.
My aunt and I. How well re¬
membered are the days. Come
May, and I’d be frantic about my
white veil. Aunt would smile in
contempt at my disorderliness and
get both our veils from her little
trunk, well folded, a little dusty,


smelling of camphor balls.
Leaves were easy to get. You
broke them off in branches from
the camuning bush at the side of
the old well. But the flowers.
Either your grandmother would
not give you the centavo with
which to buy them or the flower
vendor wouldn’t cut any of his pre¬
cious blossoms for a mere brown
coin.
What we would do: we’d save the
centavos until there were two. That
meant to-day we’d steal the flow-
ers and the next day, buy them.
You passed by a house. You looked
up at the flowers. You got suffi¬
cient courage to ask for some. You
were always refused. So you passed
on. Then you watched until the
owner went in, and you thought he
wouldn’t come out for long yet. A
stick and a few jumps did the trick.
You had the flowers. If  anyone
saw you, perhaps a malicious child
of about your own age, you ran for
dear life at the set-up cry, your
precious flowers clutched to your
laboring chest. And if the child
passed your house, you stoned him.
Luz says, let’s go to church this


afternoon. And the boys say, we
are going with you. Then we all
go into the house.
After a while Oscar goes out and
immediately sets up a hue and cry
about some children having broken
some adelfa flowers from the
branches. There is Oscar shouting
threats at the same children who
asked for flowers and were refused.
There are the pink flowers on the
ground. And one cluster has fallen
into the ditch. “Shut up, Oscar,
shut up. All that threatening.
And the flowers are on the ground.
I pinch Oscar in the arm and he
grunts at me in angry protest.
“Shut up, I tell you. Only Oscar


is a boy, that is why he rubs his
arm and mutters about sisters who
pinch with their nails.
I pick up the flowers. Adelfas
are so delicate, they are of no use
two hours after picking. Their pe¬
tals all grow limp and there is
nothing of their beauty any more.
If I put them in a vase, I’ll have to
throw them out after a while, and
Grandmother will be mumbling for
hours about her adelfas wasted that
way. I place the flowers back on
the ground. If the girls come back,
they shall see them, and pick them
up.
I hide myself in the house where
I can see them, if they return.
Grandmother comes out of the
kitchen and asks, what are you do¬
ing peeping behind the window
panes. I hurriedly close the win¬
dows lest she sees the broken flo¬
wers on the ground. Why do you
clese the windows, she asks in fret-
ful tone. She moves to open them.
“Let me open them if you want
them opened," and Grandmother
steps back in mild astonishment at
my suddenly being such a dutiful
granddaughter.
The broken blossoms are still on
the ground. If the little girls do
not come soon, the flowers will
wither on the hot earth. Even if
they pick them up now, in the eve¬

—a forgone conclusion


In the last Dental Examination, Dr. Jose V. Librojo, a graduate of our Col¬
lege of Dentistry, obtained the highest average of 87.34% — an average that
breaks the Civil Service record.
According to the official records of the Board of Pharmaceutical Examin¬
ers and Inspectors, corroborated by the report of President Bocobo to the Board
of Regents of the University of the Philippines, among the three leading col¬
leges of pharmacy in the number of candidates during the last five years, the
MANILA COLLEGE OF PHARMACY has the highest percentage of passing
candidates, and during the same period, the same college has the great¬
est number of successful candidates of all colleges of pharmacy, which means
that this college HAS THE GREATEST NUMBER OF STUDENTS, and the
public is justified in preferring this college. REGISTRATION BEGINS—

How About the
—ospital Altemer.
Wards, Operating Rooms Get
The Publicity, But The Kitchen
Is Also Important
By FERMIN B. QUEJADA


YNVHOUSANDS of interested peo¬
ple, during the island-wide
A celebration of National Hospi¬
tal Day last May 12th, were treated
to the opportunity of visiting and
viewing city and provincial hospi¬
tals, and noting how these houses
of mercy minister to the needs
of the sick. While the crowds
went with minute interest through
the surgical, medical, obstetrical,
and other departments of hospitals,
very few availed themselves of the
opportunity of visiting the hospi¬
tal kitchens.
Speaking of hospital kitchens, no
other perhaps can equal the
kitchen of the Philippine General
Hospital. From there, balanced,
tempting dishes have reached the
patient’s roem only after hours of
careful supervision and cooking at
the kitchen. And let it be said that
the main kitchen of the P G. H.
is the largest in the Philippines.
That is undisputed.
The Main Kitchen
Try inspecting the hospital kit¬
chen, and you will see a spacious,
airy hall, with complete kitchen-
ware for the preparation of all
kinds of hospital subsistence.. At
the center of the hall is a marble
U-shaped table with shelves for the
food trays. Back of the table is a


big gas hearth of about forty square
meters. On it are always found
the countless food containers with
viands cooking inside.
During the kitchen’s busiest mo¬
ments, one will notice the’ kettles
singing, the steam curling white, the
aroma of different dishes which is
pleasing to the sense of smell and
taste. Also there will be the rat¬
tle of dishes, of forks, spoons, and
knives being boiled and wiped, and
trays laid ready for immediate ser¬
vice.
Other Kitchen Sections
Just a little way off is the Char¬
ity Section. Next you open the
door leading to the lower dining
room, and the parked trolleys will
greet your eyes. On the tables may
be seen enamel trays being laden
with food for the charity patients.
You still go around and you will
discover the hospital kitchen com¬
plete with a commissary section, a
domestic science or demonstration
room, a cold storage, pantry and
scullery rooms, and of course the
office of the dietitian.
An Able Staff
The kitchen staff is composed of
Miss N. Farolan, chief dietitian,
and the Misses F. Vergara, R. Ar¬
gonza, D. Roman, and G. Batac¬
lan, assistants. There are also five

cooks, each one with an assistant;
one butcher, and thirty-six other
kitchen helpers.
Work in the hospital kitchen is
so divided that everything goes on
smoothly. Work is continuous and
quite heavy during meal hours, but
the kitchen help surprisingly keep
their temper. They even find the
humor to jest around while wash-
ing dishes, wiping trays, scrubbing
floors or scouring pans. Miss Fa¬
rolan and her efficient assistants
shower kindness around, while


drudgery is made light by the funny
antics of Mang Panyong.
Wins First Prize
The P.G.H. kitchen is not with-
out honors. It won first prize for
neatness and tidiness in last year’s
Silver Jubilee. In the recent Na¬
tional Hospital Day, May 12th,
members of the Executive Commit-
tee toured the kitchen and nodded
delightedly at the orderliness of
things in the hospital kitchen.

to him. Then the player at the or¬
gan strikes some keys, the singers
around the instrument clear their
throat and sing Dios te salve, Ma¬
ria, and after a while, the people
mumble again Santa Maria—. The
only clear words in the mumbling
are the stressed “"San" of the San¬
ta, and the Amen at the prayer’s
end.
Im finding out: I did not come
here to pray. What did I come for,
then? Why, I came for the child-


ren, dressed in white, the wreaths
of paper flowers perched on their
hair. Some have white veils and
these are he'd in place by their
wreaths. Some have only veils, and
some have nothing on their heads
at all. I came, I think, for the five
girls there, set off from the others,
kneeling at five pedestals. They
are slightly older than the rest, and
they can never sit down. They can
only kneel, their arms on the pe¬
destals, their hands folded. Their
vei’s are very long, held back at
their temples with hair pins, so
that their faces look sweet and
saintly. At the waist, their veils
are pinned up again, but even then,
they still reach to the ankles.
Before each pedestal is a letter
of flowers, and this is mounted on
a pole. Five letters: M-A-R-TA.
While the singers raise voices in
the salves, a girl stands up; takes
a letter, and walks to the altar: The
M-girl first. She walks very slow¬
ly, the letter held before her. On

Y Y OT until the bureau of plant
industry was very sure did
1 Tit announce the possibility
of profitably raising edible mush¬
rooms here like the common vegeta¬
bles. That was the other week, 1
year and 7 months after the first
attempt at raising mushrooms was
begun at the experimental plots of
the bureau.
Very Fastidious
What fresh mushrooms we have
here are chance growths in places
where they may happen to secure


a foothold: among piles of rotting
hay, at the bases of banana trunks,
on animal manures, etc. They are
very fastidious plants, requiring
just the right amount of moisture
and the particular kind of rotting
plant matter to feed on in order to
grow at all. In their wild state
they grow here from the months of
May to August. When there is no
rain or when there is too much rain
they do not show up.
It is not very surprising, then,
that local farmers have never at¬
tempted to raise mushrooms even
only for home consumption. And

even if they had wanted to, they
would have been at a loss as to
which part of the mushroom to
plant. They have taken it for
granted that mushrooms are not
within the control of man.
Experiments Successful
But the experimental work done
by the bureau of plant industry has
proved that local mushrooms can be
domesticated as easily as those they
grow in other countries. “It was
a hard job learning how to please
the mushrooms,” Dr. Feliciano M.
Clara, chief of the plant industry
p'ant pathology section, admitted.
“We had nothing to guide us in our
work, there being no previous ex¬
periments along the same line here.
We know the methods used by for¬
eign countries but our species of
mushrooms are different from
theirs and so cannot use the same
methods. We relied mostly on the
trial-and-error method."
Now the bureau is harvesting at
least two to four pounds of mush-
rooms from each of its experi¬
mental plots daily. A plot is 7 me¬
ters long by 1 meter wide. Dried
mushrooms are not so delicious as
the fresh ones, and yet those that
we import from China and Japan
sell for from ₱1.50 to P4.50 a
pound. We a’so import canned
mushrooms from the U. S. and
France.
Not Difficult To Raise
According to Dr. Clara, there is
mothing difficult in the raising of
mushrooms. Disappointments are
likely to happen in the beginning,
he said, but once the planter has
acquainted himself with the char¬
acteristics of the species he is
growing, it is easy sailing from
then on.
It was believed that mushrooms
grow best in dark places, but the
bureau has its plots exposed to the
light of the sun all day. When the
moisture conditions are controlled,
mushrooms can be raised any time
of the year. To control the mois¬
ture, one must have the plots under
a roof; the amount of water poured
into the hay each day must also
be determined.
Preparing the Spawn
The spawn in muishroom culture
roughly correspenils to the seedlings
in the case of the ordinary vege¬


table garden. Preparing the spawn
is the most difficult part in raising
mushrooms, as it requires sterile
conditions in order not to contamin¬
ate the mushroom "seeds" with
other fungi (the mushroom is a
fungus) which might prove pois¬
onous.
This is how they do it at the bu¬
reau: Ordinary rice straw is cut
into small pieces which are put in
jam jars. These jars are stoppered
loosely with cotton and then are
placed in a container through which
steam is passed for some hours.
This steaming kils all organism in
they hay and the bottle.
When the steamed hay bits have
cooled, a portion of a mushroom
stem is “planted” with the aid of
a sterile needle on the surface of
the medium. The bottle is again
carefully stoppered with the same
sterile cotton wad and placed in a
shelf in the room.
After one or two weeks the mass
of dark-colored hay bits will have
been shot through with cobweb-like

Are The Filipino Movie
Extras In Hollywood
By P. C. MORANTTE
  Hollywood Correspondent


rrHE hoggest, lousiest, dunder
headest bunch of movie ex¬
 tras in Hollywood are the Fi¬
lipinos. To use a full-dress Holly¬
wood adjective, my countrymen
working on this side of purgatory
are “hexed, teched in the haid and
just plain balmy." Frank Capra,
the ace director, and Robert Risk-
in, his scenarist, have already a
word of their own fit to describe
our movie extras from the Philip-
pines: pizilated! And the other
night, while shooting on location
at the Metropolitan Airport in
Van Nuys, Mr. Capra undoubted¬
ly used it to express his disgust
and disappointment over the Fili¬
pino's inability to grasp and fol¬
low orders during a bandit raid
scene in the "Lost Horizon" pic¬
ture. His assistant, enraged, trail¬
ed lustily after the three trucks
filled with Filipino “soldiers”
dressed like Chinese and carrying
bayoneted rifles. He stooped low
verbally to rid his system, shout¬
ing out his lungs, "Hell, hell, stop
that firing!” But even before his
sharp words of reproof had died
on his lips, there was that burst-
ing of blank bullets—bang, bang,
bang, again.


Stop Firing!
"For God’s sake, stop firing,”
cried the assistant director. "Don’t
you understand English? Captains,
talk to them, tel them to keep
their rifles safe and shut. Tell
them to stop this bang, bang!"
“Bang!" once again went off a
rifle, done either purposely or
otherwise.
The four captains
shouted, "Stop firing!”
“Stop firing!” chorused all the
boys in the trucks. The assistant
director wanted to say something,
but his words were drowned in the
chorus. He walked away, very
much disconcerted and throwing his
hands in the air in utter despair.
Several minutes later he came back
and approached the trucks.
“Listen, boys,” he said, his voice
weighted down softly by all the
loads of patience in the world out¬
side what Jesus Christ suffered in
Golgotha. "Please listen to orders.
Do not monkey with your guns.
Do not keep on firing. Please let
us do this scene right. Do you
understand me?”
“Yes, sir," all the boys chorused
again.
The assistant director then pro¬


ceeded to instruct the drivers: the
three trucks were to go to the op-
posite side of the field, about four
hundred yards away; the trucks
were to run all full speed toward
where the cameras and the directo¬
rial staff were stationed; the
machine gunner in "leader" truck
should start firing as soon as the
truck came upon the first row of
field kleig lights; then the soldiers
or Filipinos were to follow suit,
that is, keep on firing at random
as soon as the machine gunner had
started the firing.
More Stubbornness
As the trucks were about to re-
sume their positions at the other


side of the field, one of the direct-
orial aids spotted the boy at my
side wearing a felt occidental hat
instead of the Chinese kind.
“Hey, you take off that hat,”
commanded the aid. “You are sup¬
posed to be a soldier-bandit of
China, not a dandy."
“I do not have a Chinese hat,”
replied the dunce. Just why he
didn’t get one from the wardrobe
department; I can’t understand.
“Take it off, don’t wear any hat,"
said the aid.
“Okay, Ill take it off later
when we get to the other side of
the field," argued the Filipino
stupid.
“All right, but don’t forget,”
compromised the aid.
When we reached the other side
of the field, this writer, whose in¬
terest in trying to get first-hand
information on Filipino extras


drove him to get work as extra—
taking the place of a boy named
G. Bautista, reminded the boy with
the fe’t hat to remove it.
"Aw, leave it there, what’s the
use taking it off. They won’t see
me. Besides, it’s cold tonight.” He
grunted.
I left him alone. To argue with
a fool is unprofitable. It only gets
one into trouble. But that boy is
plain stupid, stubborn, and "pixi¬
lated.”
Why Dilatory Tactics
This particular sequence I men¬
tioned above was done three times
before Frank Capra and his right
hand man were satisfied, if ever


they were. It took us one hour
and a half to accomplish it pro¬
per'y. According to schedule the
scene was supposed to be made in
forty-five minutes. The seventy-five
Filipino extras who made that se¬
quence were to be dismissed after
that, that is, at 2:30 or 3:00
o’clock in the morning. Each of
the Filipino extras was to receive
the regular wage of $7.50. But
because they delayed production by
almost an hour through stupidity
and dumbness, Columbia Studios
lost $138.00. You see, for the over¬
time, each extra got $1.84 more.
In other words, for actual or active
work of 1l2 hours plus 8 hours do¬
ing nothing but standing by, each
Filipino extra got $9.34. Just how
much the company lost by the
delay, I cannot say; you see, over¬
time of the staff has to be paid
too.

For quick relief, apply MENTHOLATUM

the chest. So mony people hava found

ilipino movie extras in Hellyuood, about whom Mr. Morantte writes in the
ccompanying article.


The reason my countrymen were
glad to de'ay or hold off produc¬
tion was the paltry extra payment
for overtime. But what they did
not know was that the displeasure
they had caused the directorial
staff accounted for their being laid
off the next day. This particular
night, several men on the set ex¬
pressed open desire to dispense
with Filipinos and get Mexican In¬
dians instead.
Quarrelsome Filipino Women
Our women extras left something
much to be desired also. Filipino
girls who were brought over on
location to provide background put
up a squabble with Chinese women.
Result: the following night they
were removed from employment by
the casting office. And in meet¬
ing an American friend, this observ¬
er was asked: “In Los Angeles, I
am aware that women of various
nationalities find it hard to get
along with Filipino women. Why
is it?” I am going to answer it in
a full-length article in the imme¬
diate future.
Hogs
I opened this artic'e with the
mention of the word “hoggest."
The word is apposite to what I had
in mind—which is the common hog.
In my dictionary a hog is defined
as a "grasping, gluttonous person."
That’s exactly what our Filipino
movie extras are. They hog Tom
Gubbins’ office in Chinatown. Tom
Gubbins is agent for Central Cast¬
The Filipino boys desiring
ing.
jobs as extras go to him, pester
him, hang around his place from
morning till evening. They hog the
busses that take them to studios or
to location. They hog the ticket
windows of the studios. They hard¬
ly keep in line, unlike the Chinese
or Mexicans or Americans. They
scramble to the pay-window. They
hog the mess quarters. The only
time they never hog is when they
are asked to work. They certainly
slack down and shirk.
Vulgar-Minded
E
On thiss occasion this writer
found it extremely disgusting the


way his people hogged the mess
quarters. Shortly before midnight,
I noticed the Filipino boys disap-
pearing from the open set and
trekking in the dark toward the
wardrobe shed. I wondered why they
were leaving the field one by one.
Nobody told them to go anywhere,
and I was a trifle apprehensive lest
they be called for immediate action
and found missing. I looked at the
250 coolies, hunched together in
the field, ever ready for work. I
admired their behavior. They stay¬
ed at their posts. The Filipinos
were scattered. Some were talking
dirt. Others, feeling the cold night
air, built a fire, using studio props
It was fortunate they
for fuel.
were not found out. I wonder why
my countrymen are so lacking in
self-possession, so wanting in
decency, so bankrupt in good ideas.
I listened to their conversations
and found them vu'gar.
Dinner!
When the call to dinner was an¬
nounced, my countrymen ran to¬
wards the mess quarters as fast as
their legs could carry them. Lord,
Ive known how it is to be hungry,
too, but not even hunger is an ex¬
cuse for the gluttony I saw that
night. If one takes into consider¬
ation that the meal served was
chicken a la king plus cakes and
delicious sandwiches, there is ex-
cuse for assertion that any man,
however well fed, may be tempted
to run too. But knowing there was
more than enough for all and realiz¬
ing that we were foreigners, there
should have been proper restraint.
But I guess my people have lost all
conception of decency. And who
am I to cast the stone, anyway?
Exceptions
Not all the 75 Filipino boys who
went to Van Nuys as extras
deserve condemnation. I should
like to mention men like Fraser
Acosta, Leo Abby, Tommy Estre¬
lla, Sammy Labrador, Jack Santos,
Monico Gonzales, and a couple of
others who were there. These boys
were well-behaved. To them were
relegated the difficult task of

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
On the hour set for the funeral of Harolo
Monkhouse, his mourners: his widow, Barha¬
ra; Madeline Norris, a member of the house
old; his secretary, Wallingford; and Rupert
Mayfield, are informed by a police sergeant
that the funeral has heen ardered postponed
by the coroner who has issued summans to
the memhers of the Monkhause household to
he present at the inquest. It is revealed a
the inquest by experts consulted by the Rev.
Amos Mankhause, hrother of the dead man,
that the deceased has died of arsenic poison¬
ing and not from the ailment which had con¬
fined Harold Mankhouse to hed as an inva
lid. It is revealed that the invalid’s hottle o
medicine contains arsenic and that previous
to his death Harold Mankhouse was for a
long time suffering from arsenic paisaning.
Thers is strong suspicion from evidence so
far revealed in the inquest that the man has
heen paisoned. But haw, and by wham?
Dr. Dimsdale, the Monkhouse lamily phy¬
sician, Mrs. Mankhouse, and Miss Madeline
Norris who lives with the Mankhauses are
made to testify at the inquest. Dr. Dimsdale
is positive the arsenic which killed the in¬
valid did not come from the medicine he pre
pared for the sick man. Mrs. Monkhouse
states that her husband's relapses invariably
ecurred when she was away. Miss Norris
who teaches coaking and prepared the foos
of the invalid most of the time fails, in her
testimony, to give a clue as to haw the ar
senic which killed Harold Monkhouse was ad
m n ster d. Wallinglord, the dead man’s sec¬
retary, instead of throw ng light on the case.
only succeeds in displeasing the coroner an 
the jury with his contradictory statements.

Chapter VII
THE SEARCH WARRANT
HE consciousness of the horrid
notoriety that had already at¬
Atached itself to us was brought
home to me once more when the taxi
drew up at the house in Hilborough
Square. I stepped out first to pay
the driver, and Barbara following,
with the latch-key ready in her hand,
walked swiftly to the door, looking
neither to the right nor left, opened
it and disappeared into the hall;
while the other two, lurking in the
cab until the door was open, then
darted across the pavement, entered
and disappeared also. Nor was their
hasty retreat unjustified. Linger¬
ing doggedly and lookng about me
with a sort of resentful defiance,
found myself a focus of observa¬
tion. In the adjoining houses, not
a window appeared to be unoccu¬
pied. The usually vacant foot-wa
was populous with loiterers whose
interest in me and in the ill-omened
house was undissembled; while rau¬
cous voices, strange to those quie
precincts, told me that the astute
news-vendors had scented and ex¬
ploited a likely market.
With ill-assumed indifference I
entered the house and shut the doon
—perhaps rather noisi y and was
about to enter the dining-room when
I heard hurried steps descending the
stairs and paused to look up. It was
the woman—the cook’s sister,
think—who had been left to take
care of the house while the servants
were absent; and something of ea¬
gerness and excitement in her man¬
ner caused me to walk to the foot of
the stairs to meet her.
"Is anything amiss?” I asked in
a low voice as she neared the bottom
of the flight.
She held up a warning finger,
and coming close to me, whispered
hoarsely:
“There’s two gentlemen upstairs,
Sir, leastways they look like gentle-


men, but they are really policemen.
“What are they doing upstairs?
I asked.
"Just walking through the rooms
and looking about. They came
about a quarter of an hour ago, and
when I let them in they said they
were police officers and that they
had come to search the premises."
"Did they say anything about a
warrant?”
“Oh, yes, Sir. I forgot about
that. One of them showed me a
paper and said it was a search war¬
rant. So of course I couldn’t do
anything. And then they started
going through the house with their
note-books like auctioneers getting
ready for a sale.
“I will go up and see them, said
I; "and meanwhile you had better
let Mrs. Monkhouse know. Where
did you leave them?
"In the large back bedroom on
the first floor,”" she replied. “I
think it was Mr. Monkhouse’s.
On this I began quickly to as¬
cend the stairs, struggling to con¬
trol a feeling of resentment which,
though natural enough, I knew to
be quite unreasonable. Making my
way direct to the dead man’s
room, I entered and found two tall
men standing before an open cup
board. They turned on hearing me
enter and the elder of them drew a
large wallet from his pocket.
“Mr Mayfield, I think, Sir,"
said he. “I am Detective Superin
tendent Miller and this is Detec¬
tive-Sergeant Cope. Here is my
card and this is the search warrant,
if you wish to see it."
I glanced at the document and re¬
turning it to him asked: "Wouldn’t
it have been in order if you had
waited to show the warrant to Mrs.
Monkhouse before beginning youn
search?"
“That is what we have done,” he
replied, suavely “We have dis¬
turbed nothing yet. We have just
been making a preliminary inspec
tion. Of course,” he continued, "I
understand how unpleasant this
search is for Mrs. Monkhouse and
the rest of your friends, but you,
Sir, as a lawyer will realize the


position. That poor gentleman was
poisoned with arsenic in this house.
Somebody in this house had arsenic
in his or her possession and we
have got to see if any traces of it
are left. After all, you know, Sir,
we are acting in the interests of
everybody but the murderer.
This was so obviously true that
it left me nothing to say. Nor was
there any opportunity, for, as the
superintendent concluded, Barbara
entered the room. I looked at her
a little anxiously as I briefly ex¬
plained the situation. But there
was no occasion. Pale and sombre
of face, she was nevertheless per¬
fectly calm and self-possessed and
greeted the two officers without a
trace of resentment; indeed, when
the superintendent was disposed to
be apologetic, she cut him short by
exclaiming energetically: “But,
surely who should be more anxious
to assist you than 1? It is true that
I find it incredible that this hor¬
rible crime could have been perpet¬
rated by any member of my house¬
hold. But it was perpetrated by
somebody And if, either here or
elsewhere, 1 can help you in any
way to drag that wretch out into
the light of day, I am at your ser¬
vice, no matter who the criminal
may be. Do you wish any one to
attend you in your search?
“I think, Madam, it would be well
if you were present, and perhaps
Mr. Mayfield. If we want any of
the others, we can send for them.
Where are they now?”
“Miss Norris and Mr. Walling¬
ford are in the dining room. The
servants have just come in and I
think have gone to the kitchen or
their sitting room.
“Then,” said Miller, "we had bet¬
ter begin with the dining room."
We went down the stairs, pre¬
ceded by Barbara, who opened the
dining room door and introduced
the visitors to the two inmates in
tones as quiet and matter-of-fact as
if she were announcing the arrival
of the gas-fitter or the upholsterer.
I was sorry that the other two had

of Japan who preceded the sun god-
dess Amaterasu, reputed ancestress
of the present imperial family.


Founded by an illiterate peasant
woman, the cult was described as
a tissue of superstition; it at¬
tracted members large'y through
the claim to be a religion for mili¬
tants with the mission of spreading
Japanese influence throughout the
world.—New York Times.
But ours is a democratic coun¬
try, hence we allow our cults to
grow unmolested, although once
in a while we feel bellicose
enough to do what the Nipponese
did to the Omotokyo..


We understand now why Phil-
ippine women agitate so much for
feminine suffrage. After all, it
is truly feminine to wish not to
be left behind, very much, by
sisters in foreign lands. Here’s
the reason:
Last year (1935), women entered
into public affairs to a greater ex¬
tent than ever before. They doubled
their vote in the Dominion of Ca¬
nada election. Fifteen women con¬
tested seats in the House of Com-
mons, against four in 1930. There
are two women members of the new

No wonder we suffer a com¬
pound fracture of the illusions
when we come across a woman
built in terraces, whom we remem¬
bered while in college as breath¬
lessly sylph-like. As Dr. Rollin H.
Walker says:
“There are some girls who are so
beautiful in college that they al¬
most need a fly-swatter to keep the
boys away. But after ten years
they come back a little disillusioned.
Life has been a disappointment
and their charm has fled. And
there are other girls who attract
but little attention in college but
after they have been out ten years,
they come back and we old teachers
say: “Why did we not realize that
she was so good-looking?” The
fact is, that a certain inner radiance
has transformed her. I said to a
boy the other day: "Do you know
what God’s business is?” When he

When I was younger I went to
France to paint. Like many young
artists, I thought I needed stimula¬
tion—something outside of myself
and my environment—to make my
work more interesting and impor¬

France I realized that exotic and
unusual things had not changed
me. Indeed, I could not work as well
in France as I could at home among
the ordinary, familiar things

There’s a flourishing club in Den¬
mark which insures young women
against spinsterhood. It’s called
The Anti-Celibacy Insurance So¬

between the ages of thirteen and
twenty. The dues are low but if
she marries before she is forty
she forfeits all she has paid in
—that is, the payments are added
to the Capital Fund of the Club
Should she reach the age of
forty and still be unmarried, she
begins to collect, depending on the
stipulation in the contract and the
paid-in amount. Danish ladies
thus solve a vexing problem.

A new glass-walled factory at
Corning, New York, is to make
spun-glass wool, which has now
been brought to such a state of
perfection that it can compete
with other textiles.
Glass wool can be spun on
standard textile looms, and the
resulting fabrics are fireproof.
In the glass houses of the future,
the housewife may wear a glass
dress, have glass curtains, walk
on glass rugs, and sleep on glass
mattresses.—Literary Digest.
Our firemen will be able to
sleep peacefully or sit up late
playing checkers lazily during
these fire-inviting summer nights,
if only Manila’s houses were not
built of materials that are suscep¬
tible to combustion. There is hope
yet for firemen and their age¬
worn fire engines, for as Time
describes:


Practising Table Tennis
Alone Possible


Practice in table tennis can be done
alone with the aid of a rubber string, as
shown above.


If you need a little practice in
table tennis, here is the way to get
it alone without having to run all
over the game room after the ball.
Simply cement one end of a long
rubber string to the ball and tie the
other end to the handle of your pad¬
dle. Then you can drive the ball
across the table and return it with
the string.


Fireproof wood has been dev¬
eloped by a New Jersey manufac¬
turer who impregnated red oak
and maple in pressure tanks with
ammonium salts, which, when
hot, release combustion-smother-
ing gases. The treated wood is
almost as easily tooled as ordina¬
ry wood, and takes varnish well.
Testers from the National Board
of Fire Underwriters created con¬
flagration conditions in large
chambers fired by gas nozzles.
Although untreated walls went
up in flames, the treated wood did
not burn at all. When exposed to
intense heat for long periods, it
charred deeply, but did not pro¬
duce appreciable flame or aid the
spread of combustion.

And here’s good news for our
salt makers who always complain
that the demands do not at all
approximate the industry’s sup-
ply:
Highways of salt are now being
bui t as the result of experiments
by the International Salt Company
of Ithaca, N. Y. The salt is either
mixed with or inserted between
layers of road material and rolled
to a firm surface. It draws moist¬
ure from the air and at the same
time reduces the film of moist-
ure around each particle of clay,
so that the clay packs down hard-
er. Once the salt has crystal¬
lized on the surface, the road
sheds water during a rain and
does not become slippery or mud¬
dy. It resists traffic abrasion to
a marked degree. Salt roads can
be built for around $450 a mile,
whereas $1,500 is the minimum
cost for a mile of asphalt road. A
high'y successful one, connecting
Ithaca with its new airport, has
been in use for the past two years.

1 T is the opinion of high army
officers, among them Milita¬
 ry Adviser MacArthur, that
there is no other Filipino in the
service of either the Philippine or
the United States army who is
better prepared to organize the
military intelligence and opera¬
tions and training sections of the
Philippine Army and to act as
chief of these sections than Capt.
Fidel V. Segundo.
Capt. Segundo, whose promotion
to the rank of major of the United
States Army is expected
within a month, has been
officially invited by Pres¬
ident Quezon to join the
Philippine Army with the
rank of colonel. He is one
of the few Filipino officers
of the federal army pick¬
ed out by General Douglas
MacArthur to occupy key
positions in the Phi-ippine
Army.
The selection of Capt.
Segundo is generally re¬
garded as a happy one.
Than the U. P. command¬
ant of cadets, no Filipino
officer has had a more
varied service in the United
He served
States army
in the infantry of the U.
S. army, with station at
Fort William MCKinley
and commanded an in¬
fantry battalion in the
federalized Philippine Na¬
tional Guard, with the
rank of major. Later, he
served in the field artillery
unit of the U. S. army and
in this branch of the serv¬
ice, he attained the rank of
battery commander of the
firing batteries. He acted
as chief of plans and
training officer of the
field artillery regiment at
Fort Stotsenburg. Later,
he was transferred to the
cavalry where he command-


same school, he likewise completed
a course in machine gunnery.
Capt. Segundo is the first Fili¬
pino commandant of cadets of the
University of the Philippines. He
was appointed to that position,
succeeding Col. A. Garfinkle, in
1931. Before he was appointed
commandant, however, he was al¬
ready connected with the U. P. as
executive officer of the department
of military science. For the last
seven years, Capt. Segundo has
been engaged in giving military
instruction to all U.P. young men.


division.
Capt. Segundo comes from Laoag,
Ilocos Norte. He was born on
April 24, 1896, the son of Luciano
Segundo and Paula Ventura.
He studied in the pub-ic schools
of Laoag, Ilocos Norte, and after
completing his third year in the
high school, he came to Manila. He
finished his secondary course in
1913 at the Manila High School.
In 1913, while he was still in
the high school, he took the exa¬
mination given to candidates fon
the West Point Military Academy.
He passed the examination

and obtained the second
highest rating. He would
have been sent that year
were it not for the fact that
only one candidate was
sent to West Point in
1913.
The following year, he
enrol ed at the University
of the Philippines, taking
preparatory medicine. He
took the West Point exa¬
mination for the second
time and obtained the
highest rating. He left for
the United States in May,
1914, and entered West
Point, where he was grad¬
uated barely three years
and a half after, in August
30, 1917 He belongs to
the first "war class" of
the West Point Military
Academy.
Horse-back riding and po¬
lo are the favorite hobbies
of Capt. Segundo. He is an
expert with the pistol,
mounted and dismounted
He is also rated in the
army as expert in field
artillery and expert with
the sword (cavalry).
Capt. Segundo married
the former Miss Ange a
Agcaoili of Laoag in 1919
and has four children:
Fidel, Jr., 16; Lourdes 12;
Luciano, 8; and Bobby, 2.

Washington newspapers vie with
each other in publishing pictures of

by photographers of both the In-

WHEN PLANNING YOUR HOUSE


Remember These Fundamental
Points


PLAN 6 ELEVATION
SCALE 1100


y T is not enough that a house be
a structure with four walls,
Iseveral windows and doors, a
staircase, and a dash of paint. It
does not have to look like a "pala¬
tial mansion.” In fact, it may be
only a small cottage, but if its


construction is guided by good
taste, it carries proportion, balance.
rhythm, harmony, contrast, domin¬
ance, and unity.
Style in architecture, according
to a noted architect, is an unstable


basis of beauty in a house because
it changes with the use of new
materials, new modes of construc¬
tion, and the rise of new social hab¬
its. Architectural style, besides
being like a fashion in clothes,
chooses places: one fitted for one
country may not fit another.
However, beauty in a house can
be achieved by considering these
points:
Balance is a basic requirement.
An unbalanced structure suggests
a feeling of strain.
There should a’so be rhythm.
The eye seeks the measured repeti¬
tion of motifs, ornaments, and open¬
ings. And these may be found in
window spacing, and in the play of
light and shade in different planes.
A building is said to be in har¬
mony when there exists a common
tie that binds the composition toge¬
ther—be it their relation in shape,
color, or design. Accent provided
by contrast, dominance attained by
having a principal unit subordinat¬
ing all the lesser elements of the
design to it. All this makes for the
harmony of a structure.
Some suggestions that may be
followed in order to achieve the
best possible resu’ts in construct-
ing a home are as follows:
Plain and soft colors are best for
the exterior painting of a house.
Harsh and loud colors are ap¬
parently more attractive but they
cannot hold our eye long because
they tire them. It is always better
to fo low standard colors rather
than to experiment on new ones.
Small lots can be made to appear
larger by having a well-planned
garden in front of the house.
Shrubs and hedges produce a more
enhancing effect than a mere lawn


and are to be planted along the
edges of the lot, against the
foundation of the house, at corners
and angles of steps and porches.
Also light foliage trees are best
adapted for front planting as they
do not tend to keep the house from
view. Climbing vines must not
be over-used for its shading pro¬
perties but rather as a decorative
element in the formation of pat¬
terns of color around the house.
When they get too thick, do some
trimming. Where space does not
allow extensive landscaping, a
few flower beds will do. Paths
and other details should be avoid-
ed.

They kept their heads.
It is also worth mentioning that
our boys hate, above all things, the
imposition of whatever discipline.
Maybe, it’s because an overwhelm¬
ing majority of those who come to
work as extras were frequent
visitors to Chinatown gambling
dens, hence, demoralized an d
devoid of decent outlook.
I saw Pete Sarmiento, whilom
rich boxer and pride of the Filipi¬
nos, desperately shuffling his way
into a $7.50 job. I saw Gene Espi¬

heard, plunging into this mob, yes,
to get his share. And when all the
boys had gotten their wages,

fect of their arrival. But, of
course, they made no outward sign
of interest in any of us but pro¬


ceeded stolidly with their business;
and I noticed that, before proceed¬
ing to a detailed inspection, they


opened their note-books and glanced
through what was probably a rough
inventory, to see that nothing had
been moved in the interval since
their preliminary inspection.
The examination of the dining
room was, however, rather perfunc¬
tory. It contained nothing that
appeared to interest them, and after
going through the contents of the
sideboard cupboards methodically
the superintendent turned a leaf of
his note-book and said:
"I think that will do, Madam.
Perhaps we had better take the lib-
rary next. Who keeps the keys of
the bureau and the cupboard?
"Mr Wallingford has charge of
the library," replied Barbara, "Wi.l
you give the superintendent your
keys, Tony?”
“There’s no need for that," said
Miller. “If Mr. Wallingford will
come with us, he can unlock the
drawers and cupboard and tell us
anything that we want to know
about the contents."
Wallingford rose with a certain
alacrity and followed us into the
library, which adjoined the din¬
ing room. Here the two officers
again consulted their note-books,
and having satisfied themselves
that the room was as they had left
it, began a detailed survey, watched
closely and with evident anxiety by
Wallingford. They began with a
cupboard, or small armoire, which
formed the upper member of a
large, old-fashioned bureau. Com¬
plying with Miller’s polite request
that it might be unlocked, Walling¬
ford produced a bunch of keys, and,
selecting from it, after much ner¬
vous fumbling, a small key, endea¬
voured to insert it into the key-
hole; but his hand was in such a
palsied condition that he was un¬
able to introduce it.
“Shall I have a try, Sir?” the
superintendent suggested, patiently,
adding with a smile, "I don’t smoke
quite so many cigarettes as you
seem to."
His efforts, however, also failed,
for the evident reason that it was
the wrong key. Thereupon he
looked quickly through the bunch,
picked out another key and had the
cupboard open in a twinkling, re¬
vealing a set of shelves crammed
with a disorderly litter of card-
board boxes, empty ink-bottles,
bundles of letters and papers and
the miscellaneous rubbish that ac¬
cumulates in the receptacles of a
thoroughly untidy man. The sup-
erintendent went through the col¬
lection methodically, emptying the
shelves, one at a time, on to the
flap of the bureau, where he and
the sergeant sorted the various art-
icles and examining each, returned
it to the shelf. It was a tedious
proceeding and, so far as I could
judge, unproductive, for, when all
the shelves had been looked through
and every article separately in¬
spected, nothing was brought to
light save an empty foolscap enve¬
lope which had apparently once con¬
tained a small box and was ad¬
dressed to Wallingford, and two

Correction
Referring to my article “More
Trainee Enlightenment,” which ap-
peared in  ’s April 2nd is¬
sue, I wish to correct the impres¬
sion it has given that residents of
Zamboanga have frowned upon
compulsory military training.
On the contrary, Zamboanga res¬
idents are for military training, as
shown by reported registration re¬
sults. In my published letter, “More
Trainee Enlightenment,” I simply
wanted to point out, to bring good
results, that some particular indi¬
viduals in the barrio of Recodo,
fifteen kilometers from Zamboan¬
ga town, were averse to compulsory
military training.
I hope this correction will satis¬
fy the people of Zamboanga.

Despite the law against card

now wallows in rampant gambling.
And I might as well add: policemen
are not doing their duties properly,
because so many abuses are pre¬
sently being perpetrated on inno¬
cent people, without the culprits
being brought before the bar of
justice.
I am of the opinion, therefore,
that our town can be freed from
gambling abuses if Constabulary
soldiers are assigned here now and
then.

wanted jobs but did not want to
work, and also quoted therein the
words of President Quezon urging
the unemployed elements of the
Philippines to go to him for work,
provided they would be willing to
remove their nice ties, silk shirts
and coats and sweep the streets, or
some such form of labor.
I immediately wrote President
Quezon after I had read the edi¬
torial. And, to make a long story
short, although unemployed at the
time I read the editorial, I am now

For Livestock Stations
Establishment of livestock breed¬
ing stations in every province will
encourage our people to raise hogs.


This week we offer a poem by a well-known American poet and antho¬
logist, Louis Untermeyer.


Rebels
STIFF in midsummer green, the stolid hillsides
March with their trees, dependable and stanch.
Except where here and there a lawless maple
Thrusts to the sky one red, rebellious branch.
You see them standing out, these frank insurgents,
With that defiant and arresting plume;
Scattered, they toss this flame like some wild signal,
Calling their comrades to a brilliant doom.
What can it mean—this strange, untimely challenge;
This proclamation of an early death?
Are they so tired of earth they fly the banner
Of dissolution and a bleeding faith?
Or is it, rather than a brief defiance,
An anxious welcome to a vivid strife?
A glow, a heart-beat, and a bright acceptance
Of all the rich exuberance of life.
Rebellious or resigned, they flaunt their color,
A sudden torch, a burning battle-cry.
"Light up the world,” they wave to all the others;
'Swiftly we live and splendidly we die."
—Louis Untermeyer


goats, sheep, and chickens in their
farms. The trouble is they do not
know the advantage of raising im¬
proved breeds of animals out of
which they could derive great pro¬
fit, simply because they do not get
practical instruction along that line.
Another thing, livestock farmers
are forced to raise the ordinary
breeds because of the high cost of
buying improved ones from the Bu¬
reau of Animal Industry and their
livestock farms.
A breeding station of the Ala¬
bang Stock Farm quality, established
in each province for the purpose of
experimentation and sale of im¬
proved breeds at low prices, will be
a big inducement to the people to
produce only the better kinds of
livestock for consumption purposes.
Likewise, if this is carried out, I
am sure our meat importation will
be reduced to a great extent.

Lef's Think Twice
In “Build a Navy Also," appear¬
ing in  ’s April 9th issue,
Mr. Ramon D. Soliman of Oton,
Iloilo, suggested that for the P.I.
to build an adequate navy, each pro¬
vince should contribute one battle¬
ship, and each provincial district a
squadron of airplanes. Naval bases
and fortified forts, he added, should
be constructed at strategic points.
But I’ll simply allow Shakespeare
to answer Mr. Soliman with his: “If
to do were as easy as to know, cha¬
pels had been churches, and poor
men’s cottages princes’ palaces,
etc.” Apparently he did not look
deep into the economic situation of
the Philippines. For just how much
will one battleship cost? A squadron
of airplanes? Or naval bases and
forts? I appreciate his good ideas,
but Mr. Soliman should have con-
sidered the financial angle of the
suggestion first. It will lead him
to an accurate computation of ex¬
penses before we have those things.

pieces of what looked like chem¬

which showed that they had been
small packets. These were not re
turned to the shelves, but, without
comment, enclosed in a large enve¬

scribbled a few words with a penci
and which was then consigned to a
large handbag that the sergeant had
brought in with him from the hall.
The large drawers of the bureau

which had evidently been stuffed
into them to get them out of the

was obtained which interested the

These, however, contained nothing
but stationery and a number of let¬
ters, bills and other papers, which
the two officers glanced through
and replaced. When all the small
drawers and pigeonholes had been
examined, the superintendent stood
up, fixing a thoughtful glance at

filaments which are called myce¬
lium. These structures are the
mushroom "seedlings” to be trans¬
ferred to the plots.
The Mushroom Plot
The mushroom plot differs from
the ordinary garden plot in that it
is elevated very much above the
surface of the ground. The kind
of soil does not matter much be¬
cause mushrooms do not get their
nourishment from it. Disintegrat¬
ing ce lulose (the bulk of all plants)
forms the food of all fungi.
Soil is piled in a rectangular bed
until a sort of table 18 centimeters
high is formed. This forms the
base of the mushroom plot. Now
this is watered until the soil is
moist. Next, the spawn is broken
up into bits and particles about the
size of small buttons are planted
1 foot from each other at the up-
per edge the tab'e of soil. After
this, a loose covering of hay is scat¬
tered on the soil base until the
thickness of the whole plot is
around a meter. This decaying hay
furnishes the food of the mush-
rooms below.
Every day the hay covering is
watered. Between 11 and 17 days
from the time of planting the
spawn, the mushrooms are ready to
be harvested. One of the plots at
the bureau has continually yielded
mushrooms for a year without be¬
ing replanted. This same plot
yielded about 6 kilos every month
during the first few months.

old bureaus, this one had as a cen¬
tral feature a nest of four very
small drawers enclosed by a door. I
knew the arrangement very well,
and so, apparently, did the super
intendent; for, once more opening
the top drawer, he pulled it right
out and laid it on the writing flap.
Then, producing from his pocket a
folding foot-rule, he thrust it into
one of the pigeonholes, showing a
depth of eight and a half inches,
and then into the case of the little
drawer, which proved to be only a
fraction over five inches deep.
“There is something more here
than meets the eye,” he remarked
pleasantly. "Do you know what is
at the back of those drawers, Mr.
Wallingford?”
The unfortunate secretary, who
had been watching the officer’s pro¬
ceedings with a look of consterna¬
tien, did not reply for a few mo¬
ments, but remained staring wildly
at the aperture from which the
drawer had been taken out.
"At the back?” he stanimered, at
length. “No, I can’t say that I do.
It isn’t my bureau, you know. I
only had the use of it."
“I see,” said Miller “Well, I ex¬
pect we can soon find out.
"He drew out a second drawer
and, grasping the partition between
the two, gave a gentle pull, when
the whole nest slid easily forward
and came right out of its case.
Miller laid it on the writing flap,
and, turning it round, displayed a
sliding lid at the back, which he


drew up; when there came into view
a set of four little drawers similar
to those in front but furnished with
leather tabs instead of handles. Mil¬
ler drew out the top drawer and a
sudden change in the expression on
his face told me that he had lighted
on something that seemed to him
significant.
“Now I wonder what this is?”
said he, taking from the drawer a
small white-paper packet. "Feels
like some sort of powder. You say
you don’t know, anything about it
Mr. Wallingford?
Wallingford shook his head but
made no further reply, whereupon
the superintendent laid the packet
on the flap and very carefully un¬
folded the ends—it had already
been opened—when it was seen that
the contents consisted of some two
or three teaspoonfuls of a fine,
white powder.
“Well," said Miller, "we shall
have to find out what it is. Will
you pass me that bit of sealing¬
wax, Sergeant?”
He reclosed the packet with the
greatest care and having sealed both
the ends with his signet-ring, en¬
closed it in an envelope and put it
into his inside breast pocket. Then
he returned to the little nest of
drawers. The second drawer was
empty, but on pulling out the third,
he uttered an exclamation.
“Well, now! Look at that! Some¬
body seems to have been fond of
physic. And there’s no doubt as
to what this is. Morphine hydro-


chlor, a quarter of a grain."
As he spoke, he took out of the
drawer a little bottle filled with
tiny white dics or tablets and bear¬
ing on the label the inscription
which the superintendent had read
out. Wallingford gazed at it with
a foolish expression of surprise as
Miller held it up for our—and par¬
ticularly Wallingford’s—inspection;
and Barbara, I noticed, cast at the
latter a side-long, inscrutable glance
which I sought in vain to interpret.
“Morphine doesn’t seem much to
the point,” Miller remarked as he
wrapped the little bottle in paper
and bestowed it in his inner pocket,
“but, of course, we have only got
the evidence of the label. It may
turn out to be something else. when
the chemical gentlemen come to
test it."
With this he grasped the tab of
the bottom drawer and drew the
latter out; and in a moment his
face hardened. Very deliberately,
he picked out a small, oblong enve¬
lope, which appeared once to have
contained a box or hard packet, but
was now empty. It had evidently
come through the post and was ad-
dressed in a legible business hand
to "A. Wallingford Esq., 16 Hilbo¬
rcugh Square.” Silently the super¬
intendent held it out for us all to
see, as he fixed a stern look on
“You observe, Sir,
Wallingford.
he said, at length, “that the post-
mark is dated the 20th of August;
enly about a month ago. What
have ycu to say about it?'
"Nothing,” was the sullen reply.
“What comes to me by post is my
affair. I am not accountable to
you or anybody else.
For a moment, the superintend
ent’s face took en a very ugly ex¬
pression. But he seemed to be a
wise man and not unkindly, for he
quickly controlled his irritation and
rejoined without a trace of anger,
though gravely enough:
“Be advised by me, Mr. Walling¬
ford, and don’t make trouble for
yourself. Let me remind you what
the position is. In this house a
man has died from arsenic poison¬
ing. The police will have to find
out how that happened and if any
one is open to the suspicion of hav¬
ing poisoned him. I have come here
to-day for that purpose with full
authority to search this house. In
the course of my search I have
asked you for certain information.
and you have made a number of
false statements. Believe me, Sir,
that is a very dangerous thing to
do. It inevitably raises the ques¬
tion why those false statements
should have been made. Now,
am going to ask you one or two
questions. You are not bound to
answer them, but you will be well
advised to hold nothing back, and,
above all, to say nothing that is not
true. To begin with that packet
of powder. What do you say that
packet contains?
Wallingford, who characteristic¬
ally, was now completely cowed by
the superintendent’s thinly-veiled
threats, hung his head for a mo¬


MAASAGRMA


There seems to be no speedier way to end a headache¬
and there is certainly no safer way—than two tablets of
Cafiaspirina. If you ve tried it, you know. And if you
saw Cafiaspirina made, you would know why it is of such
uniform, dependable action. No disagreeable taste or
odor. No injurious quantities of salicylic acid to upset
the stomach. No coarse particles that won’t dissolve.
Nothing to depress the heart. So keep
these tablets handy, and keep your en¬
gagements—free from headaches, neural¬
gia, or other sudden discomfort.

QUESTION: — A love-struck
young man of our "Devil Q" so¬
ciety is engaged to a young girl
Both of them want to marry, but
the young man has no courage to
tell his parents about it because he
is presently iob'ess. Now they
want to marry secretly. Do you
think they can do it?—Blueto
Monteras, Fort Stotsenburg, Pam
panga.
ANSWER:—The new marriage
law, now in force here, prohibits
secret marriages. However, if
the girl is 18 and the young man
20 years old, they can marry each
other without their parents’ con¬
sent.—Answered by Atty. Isidro
L. Retizos,   Staff Mem¬
ber, Mani a.

QUESTION:—Where coa n I


ment and then replied, almost in¬
audibly, “Cocaine.
“What were you going to do with
cocaine?” Miller asked.
“I was going to take a little of
it for my health."
The superintendent smiled faintly
as he demanded:
“And the morphine tables?'
"I had thought of taking one of
them occasionally to—er—to steady
my nerves.
Miller nodded, and casting a
swift glance at the sergeant, asked:
"And the packet that was in this
envelope: what did that contain?”
Wallingford hesitated and was so
obviously searching for a plausible
lie that Miller interposed, per¬
suasively: “Better tell the truth and
not make trouble”: whereupon Wal¬
lingford replied in a barely audible
mumble that the packet had con¬
tained a very small quantity of co¬
caine.
"What has become of that co¬
caine?” the superintendent asked.
“I took part of it; the rest got
spilt and lost.
Miller nodded rather dubiously at
this reply and then asked:
“Where did you get this cocaine
and the morphine?"
Wallingford hesitated for some
time and at length, plucking up a
little courage again, replied:
“I would rather not answer that
question. It really has nothing to
do with your search. You are look¬
ing for arsenic."
Miller reflected for a few mo¬
ments and then rejoined, quietly:
“That isn’t quite correct, Mr.
Wallingford. I am looking for any¬
thing that may throw light on the
death of Mr. Monkhouse. But I
don’t want to press you unduly.


obtain the complete instruction and
instruments for making pop-corn
and rice, like the one made by the
Japanese?—Francisco Gimenez, Na¬
bua, Camarines Sur.
ANSWER:—T h e popping of
corn and rice is easily done by
using the popping machine. The
machine is provided with a burner
which is petroleum fed. The palay
or corn to be popped is placed in¬
side the chamber of the machine
closed, and is heated with the
burner, thus popped corn or rice
is produced.
The company dealing in the
above described machine is Osaka
Boeki Kaisha, Ltd., 446 Dasmari¬
nas, Manila.—Answered by Jose
S. Camus, director of plant indus¬
try, Manila.


only I would point out that you
could not have come by these drugs
lawfully. You are not a doctor or
a chemist. Whoever supplied you
with them was acting illegally and
you have been a party to an illegal


transaction in obtaining them.
However, if you refuse to disclose
the names of the persons who sup-
plied them, we will let the matter
pass, at least for the present; but
I remind you that you have had
these drugs in your possession and
that you may be, and probably will
be compelled to give an account of
the way in which you obtained
them.
With that he pocketed the enve¬
lope, closed the drawers and turned
to make a survey of the room. There
was very little in it, however, for
the bureau and its surmounting
cupboard were the only receptacles
in which anything could be con¬
cealed, the whole of the walls being
occupied by open-shelves about
seven feet high. But even these
the superintendent was not pre¬
pared to take at their face value.
First, he stood on a chair and ran
his eye slowly along the tops of
all the selves; then he made a lei¬
surely tour of the room, closely in¬
specting each row of books, now
and again taking one out or push
ing one in against the back of the
shelves. A set of box-files was ex¬
amined in detail, each one being
opened to ascertain that it contained
nothing but papers, and even one
or two obvious portfolios were taken
out and inspected. Nothing note¬
worthy, however, was brought to
light by this rigorous search until
the tour of inspection was nearly
completed. The superintendent was,
in fact, approaching the door when


his attention was attracted by a row
of books which seemed to be un¬
duly near the front edge of the
shelf. Opposite this he halted and
began pushing the books back, one
at a time. Suddenly I noticed that
one of the books, on being pushed,
slid back about half an inch and
stopped as if there were something
behind it. And there was. When
the superintendent grasped the
book and drew it out, there came
into view, standing against the back
of the shelf, a smallish bottle, ap-
parently empty, and bearing a
white label.
“Queer place to keep a bottle,"
Miller remarked, adding, with a
smile, "unless it were a whiskey
bottle, which it isn’t.” He drew it
out, and after looking at it suspi¬
ciously and holding it up to the
light, took out the cork and sniffed
at it. “Well,” he continued, "it is
an empty bottle and it is label ed
Benzine. Do you know anything
about it, Mr. Wallingford?
"No, I don’t,” was the reply. “I
don’t use benzine, and if I did I
should not keep it on a book-shelf.
But
I don’t see that it matters
much. There isn’t any harm in
benzine, is there?
"Probably not,” said Miller: “but,
you see, the label doesn’t agree with
the smell. What do you say, Mrs.
Monkhouse?
He once more drew out the cork
and he’d the bottle towards her.
She took it from him and having
smelled at it, replied promptly:
“It smells to me like lavender.
Possibly the bottle has had lavender
water in it, though I shouldn’t, my-
self, have chosen a benzine bottle
to keep a perfume in.
“I don’t think it was lavender
water," said the superintendent.
“That, I think, is nearly co ourless.
But the liquid that was in this bot¬
tle was red. As I hold it up to the
light, you can see a little ring of
red round the edge of the bottom.
I daresay the chemists will be able
to tell us what was in the bottle,
but the question now is, who put it
there? You are sure you can’t tell
us anything about it, Mr. Walling¬
ford?
“I have never seen it before, I
assure you,” the latter protested
almost tearfully. "I know nothing
about it, whatsoever. That is the
truth, Superintendent; I swear to
God it is.”
“Very well, Sir,” said Miller,
writing a brief note on the label
and making an entry in his note¬
book. "Perhaps it is of no impor¬
tance after all. But we shall see. I
think we have finished this room.
Perhaps, Sergeant, you might take
a look at the drawing room whi'e I
go through Mr. Monkhouse’s room.
It will save time. And I needn’t
trouble you any more just at pre¬
sent, Mr. Wallingford."
The secretary retired, somewhat
reluctantly, to the dining room
while Barbara led the way to the
first floor. As we entered the room
in which that unwitnessed tragedy
had been enacted in the dead of. the
night, I looked about me with a sort

QUESTION:—My aunt has been
suffering from Raynaud’s disease
for about eight years. Her trou¬
ble seems to be mainly with her
hands, although some parts of
her body get numb, but are not
painful as yet. She consulted a
doctor and the doctor has agreed
that an operation on the sympathe¬
tic nerve might lessen the symp-
toms but she is afraid to submit
to it as she thinks it might in¬
capacitate her hands, which are
her means of livelihood. She is
a shoe designer and seamstress.
Does this operation interfere with
skill?—An Inquirer, Manila.
ANSWER:—If t h e patient’s
physician has agreed that she is
suffering from Raynaud’s disease,
then his suggestion of an opera¬
tion on the sympathetic nerves is
a good one. That operation when
it is successful, does more good
for early cases of Raynaud’s
disease than any other treatment.
It the disease has progressed to
the gangrenous stage, operations
on the nerves do not do much
good; amputation of the gan¬
grenous finger or toe should be
done then. Manual skill or dex¬


terity will not probably be re¬
duced. The nerves which control
the movements of the hands and
fingers are not the same as the
ones which control the circulation.
—From "Hygiea."
QUESTION:—My son, aged 10
months, is suffering from diphthe¬
ria. What is the proper remedy
for it?—B. C., Tondo, Manila.
ANSWER:—When a child ac¬
tually has diphtheria the pro¬
per remedy is antitoxin. This
must be given at the earliest pos¬
sib'e moment. A very large per¬
centage of lives are saved when
antitoxin is given early enough.
Antitoxin does not protect from
another attack for more than a
few weeks, hence it does not take
the place of toxoid or toxin-anti¬
toxin. Children exposed to diph-
theria should be given a protec¬
tive dose of antitoxin if they have
not already been immunized by
toxoid or toxin-antitoxin. Anti¬
toxin is a cure and temporary pro¬
tection whereas toxoid or toxin¬
antitoxin is a life protection.
—From “The Parents’ Magazine.”


awesome stillness that pervaded
that ill-omened room.
As the superintendent carried out
his methodical search, joined pre¬
sently by the sergeant, Barbara
came and stood by me with her
eyes fixed g’oomily on the table.
“Were you thinking of him, Ru¬
pert?” she whispered. "Were you
thinking of that awful night when
he lay here, dying, all alone, and I
—Oh! the thought of it will haunt
me every day of my life until my
time comes, too, however far off
that may be."
I was about to make some reply,
as consolatory as might be, when
the superintendent announced that
he had finished and asked that
Wallingford might be sent for to
be present at the examination of his
room. I went down to deliver the
message, and, as it would have ap-
peared intrusive for me to accom¬
pany him, I stayed in the dining
room with Madeline, who, though
she had recovered from the shock
of the detectives’ arrival, was still
pale and agitated.
“Poor Tony seemed dreadfully
upset when he came back just now,
she said. "What was it that hap-
pened in the library?
"Nothing very much,” I answer¬
ed. “The superintendent unearthed
his little stock of dope; which, of
course, was unpleasant for him, but
it would not have mattered if he
had not been fool enough to lie
about it. That was a fatal thing
to do, under the circumstances.”
As Wallingford seemed not to
have said anything about the bot-
tle, I made no reference to it, but
endeavoured to distract her atten¬
tion from what was going on in the
hcuse by ta king of other matters.
Nor was it at all difficult; for the
truth is that we all, with one accord,
avoided any reference to the hor-
rible fact which was staring us in
the face, and of which we must all
have been fully conscious. So we
continued a somewhat banal conver¬
sation, punctuated by pauses in
which our thoughts stole secretly
back to the hideous realities, until,
at length, Wallingford returned.
pale and scowling, and flung himself
into an arm-chair. Madeline looked
at him inquiringly, but as he of-
fered no remark but sat in gloomy
silence, smoking furiously, she ask-
ed him no questions, nor did I.
A minute or two later, Barbara
came into the room, quietly and
with an air of calm self-possession
that was quite soothing in the
midst of the general emotional ten¬
sion.
"Do you mind coming up, Made¬
line?” she said. “They are exam¬
ining your room and they want you
to un ock the cupboard. You have
your keys about you, I suppose?”
“Yes,” Madeline replied, rising
and taking from her pocket a little
key-wallet. “That is the key. Will
you take it up to them?”
“I think you had better come up
yourself,” Barbara replied. “It is
very unpleasant but, of course,
they have to go through the formal¬


of shuddering interest. The bed had
been stripped, but otherwise nothing
seemed to be changed since I had
seen the room but a few days ago
when it was still occupied by its
dread tenant. The bedside table


still bore its pathetic furnishings;
the water-bottle, the little decanter,
the books, the candle-box, the burnt-
out lamp, the watch—though that
ticked no longer, but seemed, with
its motionless hands, to echo the

Airplane Modeling Contest Held
By JUAN E. BADILLA


TEACHERS EARNING VACATION SERVICE CREDITS


Teachers from the division of Zamboanga, district of Dipolog, who
are earning vacation service credits this summer by binding circulars,
memoranda, bulletins, etc., photographed with a portion of what they
have accomplished. Reading from the left: Pacifico Alvarez, supervising
teacher: Eleno Razo; Florencio Albano, shop teacher; and Felipe Mo¬
jares, librarian.


AKING the boys proficient
in the use of simple tools
and developing whatever
latent inventive capacities they
possess, are two fundamental aims
of industrial arts instruction in
our public schools. As a teacher
of industrial arts at the Goa Ele¬
mentary School, Camarines Norte,
had the happy experience of
teaching the boys how to make
mechanical toys and simple house¬


hold articles that appealed to their
creative instincts.
Announces Plane Contest
By the midd e of January of
this year, however, I announced an
airplane modeling contest similar
to those conducted in the United
States. I organized the seventh

grade boys into a club, the Goa
Airplane Modeling Club. I prepar¬
ed a set of rules and promised to
give prizes to the best models.
We first studied the different
types of planes, their forms, the
sizes and proportion of parts, and
the materials suited to each kind.
Plans were drawn, corrected, and
revised. I took care that the boys
made original plans, although books
and magazines like Boy Mechanic,


Flying Aces, Model Airplanes News
were utilized to get airplane ideas
from.
Interest At High Pitch
The boys became so enthusiastic
that some of them even skipped
classes to devote more time to
making their models. The club ex-
perimented in making the propeller
turn, the rudder flap, and the plane
run. A Boy Scout member of the
club equipped his model with a
control lever which, when releas¬
ed, opened the vacuum at the
wings, moved the rudder at dif-
ferent angles, and made the plane
run. Some of the models had cab¬
ins with seats, beds, and tables.
Although actual shop work re¬
quired only eighty minutes daily,
the boys worked on their models
at home during evenings and on
Saturdays and Sundays. Much time
was spent in carving parts, reshap-
ing them, assembling, finishing,
and painting. In colors. the models


looked very real.
Contest Winners
At the commencement exercises,
the planes were exhibited before
an enthusiastic audience. The Rev.
Father Canuto Acantalicio, local
parish priest, and Mr. Juan Pandes,
district supervisor acted as judges.
Plane after p'ane was passed upon
for its originality, lightness, dura¬
bility, beauty of color, and suitabi¬
lity of name.
Of the twenty-four models, first
prize went to "Air Pals," built by
Boy Scout Nazario Garchitorena.
It was a low-winged monoplane
with two powerful engines design¬
ed to carry the pilot and two pass¬
engers. “Philippine Clipper,” a
high-powered hydroplane with


four engines, equipped with ponto¬
ons, designed to carry sixteen pass¬
engers, won second prize for Fran¬
cisco Vargas. Joaquin Villarosa’s
"P. I. Protector," an army mono¬
p ane capable of great speed at
high altitudes, was honorably men¬
tioned.
Army Motif of Planes
Interestingly enough, most of the
models were army planes carrying
the names of the P. I. Army or
Commonwealth Army. The win-
ners received carpenters’ tools as
prizes, and it might be added: they
received offers for their models
from the public, but they prefer¬
red to keep their planes as souve¬
nirs of their school work.

taking a dispassionate inven¬
Itory of my features. At the
corner of my left eye there is a
pin-point mole somewhat brownish
in color. On my chin several
strands of straggly hair stand out
in confusion. There is an oval scar
the size of a mongo seed on my
forehead, about a centimeter below
the hairline. There are minute
grooves spreading outward and
downward, like so many veins in a
delicate leaf, from the tail of my
eyes.
I have known every blemish and
pore and seam and tiny wrinke on


my face. It would be the last thing
I would forget, my face. For the
past five years—perhaps ten years
—I have not missed looking into a
mirror every day. I cannot say
that I have noticed any change in
my features. Everything on my
face seems to have been there al¬
ways.
And yet this cannot be because last
night a friend whom I hadn’t seen
for years said I have grown quite
old. It is not pleasant to be told
that one has grown old. Before
last night, I had never let my mind
dwell on the possibi'ity that some
day I would have gray hair, my
teeth will loosen and fall out, my
cheeks will wither and sink into
ugly hollows.
I tell myself that it would take
years, nay, decades before I would
grow as old as that. And yet this
is poor consolation because I know
that I am growing old every min¬
ute, every second. Every breath
that I make is a breath removed
from my life. Every tick of the
watch pushes me nearer the inevit¬
able end. Inevitable. Nothing
can stop it. Not power nor wealth,
nor fame. I am growing old. But
I am not afraid. Everybody else
is being dragged along with me. A
am not afraid. No, not afraid.

ANUEL E. ARGUILLA is
Lk one of our very best short¬
story writers. We feel that his
breaking into Story and Prairie
Schooner is but a prelude to fur¬
ther triumphs of his works abroad.
His favorites:
“ESSAYISTS: Christopher Mor¬

‘The Fight.' Stevenson—for the

so curious if they had been not

Mona has long curly tresses and
a rather youthful face. Perhaps in
her younger days she was quite a
pretty girl. One day I asked her
why she didn’t marry, and she just
shook her head.
Pablo is a widower and a jolly
fellow. His loves can be counted:
tuba, his game cock, and Junior.
Junior is our land ady’s son. What
is queer is, Mona loves Junior too.
That seemed to be the only thing
she and Pablo had in common. If
somebody suggested that she had
better marry Pablo, she would
transfix him with a glare. If you
asked Pablo why he did not marry
Mona, he would say, "Marry her?
Not if she is the last woman on
earth and I the last man."
Last week I noticed that for
once Mona and Pablo did not quar¬
rel. And Mona acted queerly. The
fo lowing Sunday Mona and Pablo
were married quietly. Yesterday
I surprised Mona sewing tiny gar¬

of men. Pains in the waist, fatigue,
nervousness, swollen ankles, diffi¬

kidney trouble. Hot passages, fre¬

ities, and we must not appear un¬
wil'ing to help them."
"No, of course,” said Madeline.
“Then I will come with you, but I
should like Rupert to come, too, if
he doesn’t mind. Will you?” she
asked, looking at me appealingly.
“Those policemen make me feel so
nervous."
Of course, I assented at once; and
as Wallingford, muttering "Damned
impertinence! Infernal indignity!"
rose to open the door for us, we
passed out and took our way up¬
stairs.
“I am sorry to trouble you, Miss
Norris," said Miller, in a suave
tone, as we entered, “but we must
see everythingvif only to be able to
say that we have. Would you be so
kind as to unlock this cupboard?
He indicated a narrow cupboaro
which occupied one of the recesses
by the chimney-breast, and Made¬
line at once inserted the key and
threw open the door. The interior
was seen to be occupied by shelves,
of which the lower ones were filled
tidily enough, with an assortment
of miscellaneous articles—shoes,
shoe-trees, brushes, leather bags,
cardboard boxes, notebooks and
other "oddments”—while the top
shelf seemed to have been used as
a repository for jars, pots and bot¬
tles, of which several appeared to
be empty. It was this shelf which
seemed to attract the superinten¬
dent’s attention and he began ope¬
rations by handing out its various
contents to the sergeant, who set
them down on a table in orderly
rows. When they were all set out
and the superintendent had inspect¬
ed narrowly and swept his hand
over the empty shelf, the examin¬
ation of the jars and bott'es began.
The procedure was very method¬
ical and thorough. First, the ser¬
geant picked up a bottle or jar,
locked it over carefully read the la¬
bel if there was one, uncovered or
uncorked it, smelled it and passed
it to the superintendent, who, when
he had made a similar inspection,
put it down at the opposite end of
the table.
“Can you tell us what this is?”
Miller asked, holding out a bott'e
filled with a thickish, nearly black
liquid.
“That is caramel,” Madeline re¬
plied. “I use it in my cookery
classes and for cooking at home,
too."
The superintendent regarded the
bottle a litt'e dubiously but set if
down at the end of the table with¬
out comment. Presently he receiv¬
ed from the sergeant a glass jar
filled with a brownish powder.
“There is no label on this.” he
remarked, exhibiting it to Madeline.
“No.” she replied. “It is turmeric.
That also is used in my classes;
and that other is powdered saffron."
“I wonder you don’t label them,"
said Mi ler. “It would be easy for
a mistake to occur with all these
unlabelled bottles."
“Yes,” she admitted, “they ought
to be labelled. But I know what


each of them is, and they are all
pretty harmless. Most of them are
materials that are used in cookery
demonstrations, but that one that
you have now is French cha’k,
and the one the sergeant has is
pumice-powder."
"H’m" grunted Miller, dipping
his finger into the former and rub¬
bing it on his thumb; "what would
happen if you thickened a soup
with French chalk or pumice-pow¬
der? Not very good for the diges¬
tion, I should think."
“No, I suppose not,” Madeline
agreed, with the ghost of a smile
on her pale face. “I must label
them in future."
During this colloquy I had been
rapidly casting my eye over the
collection that stil awaited exami¬
nation, and my attention had been
almost at once arrested by an empty
bottle near the end of the row. It
looked to me like the exact count-
erpart of the bottle which had
been found in the library; a cylin¬
drical bottle of about the capacity
of half a pint, or rather less, and
like the other, labelled in printed
characters “Benzine.
But mine was not the only eye
that had observed it. Presently, I
saw the sergeant pick it up—out
of its turn—scrutinize it suspi¬
cious'y, hold it up to the light, take
out the cork and smel both it and the
bottle, and then, directing the latter,
telescope-fashion, towards the
windows, inspect the bottom by
peering in through the mouth.
Finally, he clapped in the cork with
some emphasis, and with a glance
full of meaning handed the bottle
to the superintendent.
The latter repeated the procedure
in even more detail. When he had
finished, he turned to Made ine
with a distinctly inquisitorial air.
“This bottle, Miss Norris," said
he, "is labelled 'Benzine.' But it
was not benzine that it contained.
Will you kindly smell it and tell me
what you think it did contain. Or
perhaps you can say off-hand.
“I am afraid I can’t,” she rep'ied.
“I have no recollection of having
had any benzine and I don’t remem¬
ber this bottle at all. As it is in
my cupboard I suppose I must have
put it there, but I don’t remember
having ever seen it before. I can’t
tell you anything about it."
“Well, will you kindly smell it
and tel me what you think it con¬
tained?” the superintendent per¬
sisted, handing her the open bottle.
She took it from him apprehensive¬
ly, and, holding it to her nose, took
a deep sniff; and instantly her al¬
ready pale face became dead white
to the very lips.
“It smells of lavender," she said
in a faint voice.
“So I thought," said Miller.
“And now, Miss Norris, if you will
look it at the mouth of the bottle
against the light you will see a faint
red ring round the bottom. Appar¬
ently, the liquid that the bottle con¬
tained was a red liquid. Moreover,
if you hold the bottle against the
light and look through—the label,
you can see the remains of another

label under it. There is only a tiny
scrap of it left, but it is enough
for us to see that it was a red
label. So it would seem that the
liquid was a poisonous liquid¬
poisonous enough to require a red
poison label. And then you notice
that this red poison label seems to
have been scraped off and the ben¬
zine label stuck on over the place
where it had been, although, as
the lavender smell and the red
stain clearly show the bottle never
had any benzine in it at all. Now
Miss Norris, bearing those facts in
mind, I ask you if you can tell me
what was in that bottle.
“I have told you,” Madeline re
plied with unexpected firmness,
that I know nothing about this
bott'e. I have no recollection of
ever having seen it before.
I do
not believe that it ever belonge

board when I first began to n¬

occasion to remark to the superin¬

me.
The bottle having been carefully
wrapped up and deposited in the
sergeant’s hand-bag, the examina¬
tion was resumed; but nothing fur¬
ther of an interesting or suspicious
character was discovered among
the bottles or jars. Nor did the
sorting-out of the miscellaneous
contents of the lower shelves yield
anything remarkable with a single
exception. When the objects on the
lowest shelf had been all taken out
a small piece of white paper was
seen at the back, and on this Miller
pounged with some eagerness. As
he brought it out I could see that
it was a chemist’s powder paper
about six inches square (when Mil¬
ler had carefully straightened it
out), and the creases which marked
e places where it had been fold
ed showed that it had contained a
nass of about the bulk of a dessert¬
poonful. But what attracted my
tention—and the superintendent’s
-was the corner of a red label
nich adhered to a torn edge in
mpany with a larger fragment of
vhite label on which the name
lescription of the contents had
sumably been written or print¬
Miller held it out towards Ma¬
line, who looked at it with a puz¬
ad frown.
“Do yolemember what was in
his paper, Miss Ntrsis?” the for¬
mer asked.
“I am afraid I don’t, she replied.
"H’m," grunted Miller; “I shou'o
have thought you would. It seems
to have been a good-sized powder
and it had a poison label in addi¬
tion to the descriptive label.
should have thought that would
have recalled it to your memory.
“So should I,” said Madeline.
“But I don’t remember having
bought any powder that would be
labelled "poison. It is very odd
and it is odd that the paper shoulo
be there. I don’t usually put waste
paper into my cupboard.
“Well, there it is, said Miller;
but if you can’t remember any
thing about it, we must see if the
analysts can find out what was in
it.” With which he folded it and
having put it into an envelope,
bestowed it in his pocket in com¬
pany with his other treasures.
This was the last of the discov
eries. When they had finishec
their inspection of Madeline’s room
the officers went on to Barbara’s
which they examined with the same
minute care as they had bestowed

on the others, but without bringing
anything of interest to light. Then
they inspected the servants’ bedrooms
and finally the kitchen and the
other premises appertaining to
it, but still without result. It was
a tedious affair and we were all
relieved when, at last, it came to
an end. Barbara and I escorted
the two detectives to the street
door, at which the superintendent
paused to make a few polite ac¬
knowledgments.
said he, “for the help you have
given us and for the kind and rea¬
sonable spirit in which you have
accepted a disagreeable necessity.
I assure you that we do not usual¬
ly meet with so much considera¬
tion. A search of this kind is al¬
ways an unpleasant duty to carry
cut and it is not made any more
pleasant by a hosti'e attitude on
the part of the persons concerned."
“I can understand that, replied
Barbara: “but really the thanks
are due from me for the very
courteous and considerate way in
which you have discharged what I
am sure must be a most disagrce¬
able duty. And of course, it had
to be; and I am glad that it has
been done so thoroughly. I never
supposed that you would find what
you are seeking in this house. But
it was necessary that the search
should be made here if only to
prove that you must look for it
somewhere else.
Aite so, Madam, the super¬
intendent refrrrlad a little drily:
"and now I wil wish yotr—xood af¬
ternoon and hope that we shalr
have no further occasion to trou¬
ble you.
As I closed the street door and
turned back along the hall, the
dining room door-—apparently al¬
ready ajar—opened and Madeline
and Wallingtord stepped out; and
I could not help refleating, as .
noted their pa e, anxious faces and
shaken bearing, how little their ap¬
pearance supported the confident,
optimistic tone of Barbara’s last
remark. But, at any rate, they
were intensely relicved that the
ordeal was over, and Wallingford
even showed signs of returning
truculence. Whatever he was go¬
ing to say, however, was cut short
by Barbara, who, passing the door
and moving towards the staircase,
addressed me over her shoulder.
"Do you mind coming up to my
den, Rupert? I want to ask your
advice about one or two things.
The request seemed a little in¬
opportune; but it was uttered as a
command and I had no choice but
to obey. Accordingly, I followed
Barbara up the stairs, leaving the
other two in the hall, evidently
rather disconcerted by this sudden
retreat. At the turn of the stairs
I looked down on the two pale
faces. In Madeline’s I seemed to
read a new apprehensiveness, ting¬
ed with suspicion; on Walling¬
ford’s a scowl of furious anger
which I had no patience to seek
to interpret.

SWIMMING
A new Phi ippine record in the
100-meter free style was chalked
up by Jikirum Adjaludin, crack
Army free style splasher, in the
Olympic try-outs May 13th, wher
he made the distance in 59 seconds
flat. The standing P. I. record
which he made during the recent
P.I.-Formosa dual meet is 59.9
seconds. Nils A. Christiansen was
clocked at 1:9.5 in the 100-meter
backstroke, which is 1.5 seconds
faster than the P.A.A.F. qualify-
ing standard for the Berlin Olym-
 pics.

A big upset was created last Fri¬
day night, when Lou Salvador’s
Plaza dribblers trounced the P. I.
Olympic basketeers,. 26-25, at the
Jose Rizal Field. With only four
minutes more to go. the Olympic
team was leading, 25-20; but the
Plaza dribblers gave a last-min¬

There must be prayers that do
not have to be mumbled. When you
are looking up at stars in the night
when you don’t feel sleepy at all,
you a’so pray, in a way. And you
don’t mumble. And I don’t know
how I pray, but I do pray. It isn’t
like this mumbling, but I pray
somehow. Only I don’t know whe¬
ther I should pray like them, or
they should pray like me.
But at least I do know I did not
come here to pray. I came for the
children. The sacristan now is roll¬
ing black oilc'oth over the white
linen of the altar. For the flowers,
the wet flowers. They start now.
Forming figures in the cleared
space first. To-day the figure is a
lyre. Then journeys to the altar,
eight girls at a time. And the flo¬
wers pile up on the oilcloth, look¬
ing, even the withered ones, like
wax in the light.
I came for the children, yes, and
for the singing. Because all the
while, there is singing. That is
Aurea’s voice now there, my friend
Aurea, the short one with the voice
that trills, and then softens, and
murmurs, raising the hair on your
neck and above your ears all on
end. That is she with her hands
clasped in front of her, her face
tilted up to the Mother, singing
with her mouth and her eyes, and
her fingers that she clasps, un¬
clasps, and now clasps again.
"Sa mga bitoon sa langit,
Ikaw ang labi pang mahayag—
I came for the end of the service
when all the girls have done with
putting their flowers on the altar
and everyone kneels. And Aurea
sings to the accompaniment of a
violin and the organ. All the other
voices hush but hers, and she too
knee's. She sings very softly, no
trills anymore to her voice.
I came for this. The bells strik-
ing the Angelus hour and Aurea’s
voice floating above all the others.
Now and then the girls join in,
Adios, Adios! All your flesh creeps
and your scalp tightens.
The people somehow a’l stand up
and start to leave, and the little
girls rush to the altar to beg the
sacristan to allow them to pick the
fresh flowers so they can offer
these again tomorrow. The sacris¬
tan shooes them off.
Here is Luz with me. And Oscar.
I have forgotten them. I look down
at Luz. She is telling me how beau¬
tiful the angel-gir’s are. Luz, she
can never be angel, either. “Ever
been in the Flores, Luz?” No, Luz
says, because she has no white

may or may not be for the common

by making them a thinking mass

dresses, no white veil, no wreath
for her head, and—. This girl has
an appalling .ot of haven’t-gots.
Tomorrow Luz shall enter the
rehearsals. She shall be in the
Fores. But they don’t include
children in the rehearsals unless
they can say “Our Father" and
"Hail Mary” through in the dialeci
at least. “Know those prayers
Luz?” Yes, she knows them, but in
the Spanish. Well. the priest will
like that better. "“Say them, Luz.
She recites them through perfectly.
“Understand them, Luz?” Not one
word of it. I translate into the dia¬
lect. But even that she can’t un¬
derstand.
But she knows the Spanish. Per
haps ater on, she will know it in
English and understand it better
than her own tongue. Perhaps la¬
ter on, she will wonder about
“Give us this day, our daily bread"
and think it not quite compliant af¬
ter one has just said “Your will be
done.” Perhaps she will think the
two phrases so close together sound
ambiguous, but she will, in all like¬
lihood, keep on repeating the pray
er through.
And yet she must believe there is
a God. She must believe in it. Be¬
cause there is. I can’t teach her
anything, since I don’t know any¬
thing. But He is there. At least,
the singing will make her feel. He
is. And looking into the eyes of
the Mother, she’ll know. He is. If
she never doubts abcut it, or about
the way of prayer, then she will be
happy. She’ll say it’s the perfect


thing to repeat words one memoriz-
es by mouth, words that are not in
one’s heart. Perhaps the words will
even be in her heart, with her heart.
Then she will be blessed.
But she needs something. I don’t
know what it is. In my not know¬
ing. I can only say—she will be in
the Flores tomorrow.
Next morning, after rehearsal is
over, Luz comes home eager for the
new dress I made her. Admiring
the white wisp of veil. Amusing
hersef with putting the cloth on
her head. The dress fits. Luz will
have flowers, plenty of them.
There are flowers on the manol.
Every one will go smelling Luz"
head this afternoon.
Only, this afternoon, Luz is not
going to church. She has coaxed
five centavos from her mother and
she has gone to a movie with my
two brothers, and another kid.
They will come home in time for
supper.
Wel' there are thirty-one days in
May. Only two of them gone. Still
twenty-nine left. And every year
there must be about fifty-two Sun¬
days. And enough holidays. Luz
knows two prayers in Spanish. Luz
will grow up. Luz will pray. She
will wear thin veils, and later on
perhaps, go to church in May. But
this afternoon, Luz is in a movie.

lyre. Then journeys to the altar,
eight girls at a time. And the flo¬
wers pile up on the oilcloth, look-
ing, even the withered ones, like
wax in the light.
I came for the children, yes, and
for the singing. Because all the
while, there is singing. That is
Aurea’s voice now, there, my friend
Aurea, the short one with the voice
that trills, and then softens, and
murmurs, raising the hair on youn
neck and above your ears all on
end. That is she with her hands
clasped in front of her, her face
tilted up to the Mother, singing
with her mouth and her eyes, and
her fingers that she clasps, un¬
clasps, and now clasps again.
"Sa mga bitoon sa langit,
Ikaw ang labi pang mahayag—
I came for the end of the service
when all the girls have done with
putting their flowers on the altar
and everyone kneels. And Aurea
sings to the accompaniment of a
violin and the organ. All the other
voices hush but hers, and she too
knee's. She sings very softly no
trills anymore to her voice.
I came for this. The bells strik-
ing the Angelus hour and Aurea’s
voice floating above all the others.
Now and then the girls join in,
Adios, Adios! All your flesh creeps
and your scalp tightens.
The people somehow a’l stand up
and start to leave, and the little
girls rush to the altar to beg the
sacristan to allow them to pick the
fresh flowers so they can offer
these again tomorrow. The sacris¬
tan shooes them off.
Here is Luz with me. And Oscar.
I have forgotten them. I look down
at Luz. She is telling me how beau¬
tiful the angel-gir's are. Luz, she
can never be angel, either. “Ever
been in the Flores, Luz?” No, Luz
says, because she has no white

may or may not be for the common

by making them a thinking mass
and then we can say more or less
pontifically that books cannot cor¬

dresses, no white veil, no wreath
for her head, and—. This girl has
an appalling .ot of haven’t-gots.
Tomorrow, Luz shall enter the
rehearsals. She shall be in the
Fores. But they don’t include
children in the rehearsals unless
they can say “Our Father" and
“Hail Mary” through in the dialect
at least. “Know those prayers,
Luz?” Yes, she knows them, but in
the Spanish. Well, the priest will
like that better. “Say them, Luz.
She recites them through perfectly
“Understand them, Luz?” Not one
word of it. I translate into the dia¬
lect. But even that she can’t un¬
derstand.
But she knows the Spanish. Per¬
haps ater on, she will know it in
English and understand it better
than her own tongue. Perhaps la¬
ter on, she will wonder about
“Give us this day, our daily bread"
and think it not quite compliant af¬
ter one has just said “Your will be
done. Perhaps she will think the
two phrases so close together sound
ambiguous, but she will, in all like¬
lihood, keep on repeating the pray¬
er through.
And yet she must believe there is
a God. She must believe in it. Be¬
cause there is. I can’t teach her
anything, since I don’t know any¬
thing. But He is there. At least,
the singing will make her feel. He
is. And looking into the eyes of
the Mother, she’ll know. He is. If
she never doubts abcut it, or about
the way of prayer, then she will be
happy. She’ll say it’s the perfect


thing to repeat words one memoriz¬
es by mouth, words that are not in
ene’s heart. Perhaps the words will
even be in her heart, with her heart.
Then she will be blessed.
But she needs something. I don’t
know what it is. In my not know¬
ing. I can only say—she will be in
the Flores tomorrow.
Next morning, after rehearsal is
over, Luz comes home eager for the
new dress I made her. Admiring
the white wisp of veil. Amusing
herse'f with putting the cloth on
her head. The dress fits. Luz will
have flowers, plenty of them.
There are flowers on the manol.
Every one will go smelling Luz"
head this afternoon.
Only, this afternoon, Luz is not
going to church. She has coaxed
five centavos from her mother and
she has gone to a movie with my
two brothers, and another kid.
They will come home in time for
supper.
Wel' there are thirty-one days in
May. Only two of them gone. Still
twenty-nine left. And every year
there must be about fifty-two Sun¬
days. And enough holidays. Luz
knows two prayers in Spanish. Luz
will grow up. Luz will pray. She
will wear thin veils, and later on
perhaps, go to church in May. But
this afternoon, Luz is in a movie.

Yachts in Other Lands
Yachting is the sport of chief exe¬
cutives and the moneyed kings of
Europe. President Roosevelt, since
his election, has been going up and
down the Potomac aboard Vincent
Astor’s ₱600,000 Nourmahal on
week-ends. Last month, President
Roosevelt outfitted and refurnished
the old coastguard Electra, re¬
christened it Potomac, and placed it
at his disposa!. It is recalled that
the Mayflower, which enabled many
an American chief executive to take
pleasure cruises down the Potomac
to the sea was dismantled by Pres¬
ident Hoover after President Coo¬
lidge spent about P500,000 for its
repair. It was costing the U. S.
government too much, Hoover, be¬
lieved. When Roosevelt became

LITTLE PANCHO DEFEATS
FLYWEIGHT CHAMPION,
Little Pancho, younger brother
of the late Pancho, closely defeated
Little Dado, flyweight champion of
the Orient, at the Rizal Memorial
Stadium last Saturday night. Lit¬
tle Pancho, however, could not an¬
nex the f yweight crown because he
entered the ring a pound heavier
than the flyweight limit. On the
same card Joe Mendiola and Joe

seconds); the 440-yard relay by the
U. S. C. quartet (40 7 seconds);
the middle relay by the U. S. C.
(3 minutes, 11.6 seconds).
* * *
The world’s record in the 100
yards was last May 16th bettered
by Jess Owens, Ohio State Univer¬
sity Negro speed ace, when he
breasted the tape in 9.3 seconds
during the Chio-Wisconsin meet in
Madison. Wisconsin. The record
shattered was established by Wy-
koff in 1930, when he covered the
distance in 9.4 seconds.

half of the game, the Americans
were winning, 26-24. After the

COMMENTS


WHY AYACHT? E AN the government be serious about buying
 a yacht? That is the question many people
asked when it was announced that Resident Commissioner Paredes was
shopping around in the United States for such a vessel. But it is true,
the government is intending to buy one. Mr. Vargas, secretary to the
President, explained that the new vessel is necessary because at present
there is only one coast guard functioning. The rest, some four of them,
cannot be used because they need repairs and it would cost a great deal
to have them repaired and a great deal more to operate them.
But then, if a new vessel for patrol work is necessary, why a
yacht? Yachts, at least the kind the government intends to buy, are
built for speed and luxury and in their construction and maintenance,
expense is a minor consideration. What possible reason can the Philippine
government have, short of funds as it is, for wanting to own one of these
floating palaces? As it is, four government cutters are tied up for lack
of money for their repair and operation. Why then buy a vessel which
will not only be expensive to acquire but expensive to maintain?
For the price the government intends to spend for a yacht,
around half a million pesos, two vessels more suitable to coast guard
work may be had. They will necessarily not be floating palaces, but
they will serve the purpose adequately and inexpensively and will be more
in keeping with the finances of the government.
Incidentally, it should be said that if the government must buy
new vessels, more precaution than was exhibited in the past be taken.
The last two bought by the government had so many imperfections in
them, the government had to spend more money for repairs before they
could be used.

AN EXCELLENT IDEA
S partment of the Interior has is-
sued a circular requiring all employees under his department to plant
useful crops in their lots in Manila and in the provinces. The idea is ex-
cellent because of its educational possibilities. People in the govern¬
ment service serve as models in their respective localities, the masses
looking up to them and following their examples.
Common sense convinces us that no amount of explanation would
make the masses see the usefulness of utilizing empty, weed-infested
yards for vegetables and other useful crops. The masses want to be
shown; they want examples. And no group of men are more capable
of giving practical examples to the people than those employed by the
government. Let government employees show that garden plots are
useful and that these employees are not above raising vegetables in
their backyard, and the masses will follow.
Government employees will not only be augmenting the meagre in-
come they are getting from the public treasury by raising garden crops,
they will also be performing a great patriotic duty to the nation.

EXPLANATION YFit is true that there is something like dissatis¬
I faction in the Philippine Army on account of
the recent appointments to ranking posts in the organization, the dis¬
content arising from alleged favoritism in the appointments, the expla¬
nation of Major General Douglas MacArthur, the President’s military ad-
viser, should restore the composure of the discontented.
There was no favoritism, according to General MacArthur. This
should be accepted as the truth, as convincing evidence that the men sel-
ected to head the Army are the best available. To continue to doubt this,
whether the doubt be from within the Army or outside, is to weaken
the national military organization materially. It is an army next to
useless which its own men or the people it seeks to protect have no
confidence in.

A Navy?


yE are wondering if the pro¬
W jected purchase of a yacht
by the government is any indica¬
tion that we are thinking of start¬
ing a navy. It may be wise to ap¬
point a couple of admirals now,
just in case.


No Help
YF you were in doubt about the
1 identity of a snake, and you had
yourself bitten just to find out, you
would be called crazy if you survived
your curiosity.
But that is, in effect, how the
government wants you to act. You
have got to be stung first by any of
the current flock of money-mad
snakes who go about with various
financial schemes before the justice
arm of the government would give
you needed help.
Should you play safe and go to the
fiscal’s office and ask him about the
legality of a certain attractive mo¬
ney-making proposition, a safe me¬
thod of identifying a human snake,
you will get no more than official re¬
gret that the law does not authorize
the fiscal’s office to render any opi¬
nion at the request of the curious.
But if you should approach the
fiscals, weeping about the sad fact
that you have already parted with
your money and that you have been
le.
stung, well, that’s different.
would try to do something about it.
Remember: you’ve got to get stung
first before you get any help.
May we suggest, before we get
into the luxury of appointing town
planning boards, that pigs, goats,
carabaos, and cows be shooed
away from town plazas. Something
ought to be done also about the
weeds and mudholes and the
dust.


If Samar had half a dozen more
acting governors, the drawings to sel¬
ect the province’s military trainees
might have taken place last week on
the required hour. But as it was
there were only an acting governor
who was aboard a vessel from Ma¬
nila, another who had been shorn of
his powers early in the morning of
May 15th, and still another (this one
representing the real provincial gov¬
ernor) who was out of town.
