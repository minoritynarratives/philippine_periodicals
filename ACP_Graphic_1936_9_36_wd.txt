Miss DOMINGA CAPATI of
Canlubang, Laguna, Triumphs
in Philippine Golf Open for
Women at Caloocan
The sensation of the sports world for 1936, is the new
champion of the women, Miss Dominga Capati, Canlubang
golf enthusiast coached by former Champion Larry Montes.
In the last group of 16 women contestants, she was the only
Filipina, the others being American and European ladies.
Miss Capati came through in first place. On February 2 she
played at the Wack Wack club in a foursome which included
Mr. P. B. Santos, well known amateur golfer.
Mr. Santos describes her play:
“Our match in Wack Wack was the first time Miss Capati
had played on the Mandaluyong course which is the most
difficult in the Philippines, if not in the Far East.
“Several times she drove the ball over 200 yards, long drives
for men players, exceptionally long for a woman. She has
a slow regular backswing, comes down on the ball hard and
fast, following through in the form that we all try to
imitate.
“I consider the feat of Miss Capati in winning the women's
championship a great achievement. She is the first Filipina
to ever win this honor. This will inspire many other of our
Filipina ladies to keep up their interest in sports which are
clean and wholesome.


Talking it over at the 10th Tee House, Mr. Santos
and Miss Capati.


“While we were sitting in the tee house, Miss Capati asked
me about my business. I told her I am an Insular Life Un¬
derwriter. I was pleased to find that she was quite familiar
with our company and was interested in life insurance.
After a brief explanation she expressed a desire to apply
for one of our Blue policies and it has been my pleasure to
deliver to her an Insular Life policy which is a combination
of savings and protection.

YERHAPS, if you are a young father
or a young mother, you have been
Aperplexed about whether or not to
spank Junior or little Norma for some
misbehavior. Your first impulse is for
an old-fashioned spanking, but you re¬
member you have read a lot about the
danger of spanking: it will give the child
inferiority complex and all that.
We are not trying to help you de¬
cide what to do but it might prove in¬
teresting to you to know that several
well-known fathers, among them two
supreme court justices, a bureau director,
and a university professor have very de¬
finite opinions on the matter. Turn to
page 4.
But little children are not the only
problems of parents. The grown-up ones
are, too, only in the latter case the prob¬
lem quite often is about what the scion
of the family failed to learn in spite of
his education. Again we have the testi¬
mony (see page 9) of a number of peo¬
ble whose opinions count.
) ECAUSE we took one or two courses
in economics when we were in school
we like to believe we are simply in love
with economic subjects and we indulge
this weakness of ours at every oppor¬
tunity. Hence, the two articles (pages
10 and 11) on the province of Isabela,
up and coming province of the Cagayan
Valley. Incidentally we should like to
say that if what Isabela people are doing
people in “one-product" provinces will
do, the possible loss of the market for
their present only products need not be
so terrifying.
Npage 12 we have an article the
Oauthor of which expresses the opi¬
nion that Japan will not, even if she
wants to, grab the Philippines. He be¬
lieves England and other Western colon¬
izers in Asia will object and Japan will
not go into a war against a combination
of Western powers just to get the Phil¬
ippines.
Personally, we feel this is poor com-
fort: this hoping or imagining England
and other Western powers will intimidate
Japan out of the Philippines. We hope
the author is right, but we would not
bank on that and would prefer to fall in
ine with the President’s "toughening’
program, just in case.
The safety of the country with res¬
pect to foreign aggression is not the only
problem of the Commonwealth. In a way,
the problem of getting funds for the va¬
rious activities of the government is
much more important, at least, more
pressing.
A bill abolishing the cedula tax is
now pending in the National Assembly.
While popular among the majority of
cedula tax payers and politicians, the bill
is opposed by many. Mr. Jose E. Collado,
in the article on page 14, gives some very
enlightening reasons why the tax should
not be abolished and pleads for the de¬
feat of the pending bill for the abolition
of the cedula tax.

nobility of Carlos in J. C. Dioni¬

THE SPOTLIGHT


coming issues
FEVIME and again you have felt, that
is, if you make it a habit to follow
A developments in this country of
ours, that there are many things you want
done or will do to improve the country.
If only you have the chance! We have
felt that way many times ourself.
What are these things we want done
if only we have the chance to have them
done? Say, if you were Dictator?
Those who answered this question,
do not miss next week’s issue, are the
following: President Nicanor Reyes of
the Far Eastern University ex-Judge
Anastacio Teodoro, ex-Director of Labor
Hermenegildo Cruz, Dr Angel Trinidad,
secretary of the Anti-Tuberculosis So¬
ciety: Dean Jose Espiritu of the college
of law, U.P.; Manager Gregorio Anonas
of the Metropolitan Water District, Reg¬
istrar Melquiades Gamboa of the U. P.,
and Enrique Altavas, chief of the land
registration office.
UR Hollywood correspondent made
O another visit of exploration through
the world’s most famous movie colony and
was shown some of the letters addressed
to movie stars by movie fans from the
Philippines. Being a Filipino, we ima¬
gine Mr. Morantte, our correspondent,
must have been very much embarrassed
when confronted by the letters. He did
not tell us he was, but.... well, he has
something to say about this in our next
issue.
- NE day last week, the President had
another opportunity to warm up to
his favorite subject: national defense. In
a speech delivered before the students of
the University of the Philippines the
Chief Executive appealed to the young
people of the country to lead in the cru¬
sade for national defense.
Has it ever occurred to those inte¬
rested in national defense to know just
how the Moros feel about this naticnal
defense scheme? As Filipinos they
will have to shoulder their share of the
burden of defending the country. A La¬
nao citizen, Mr. Luis A. Quibranza, must
have been wondering about this matter
too, for he has taken the initiative in
sounding the opinion of representative
Moros.
Next week, we shall pub’ish what
Mr. Quibranza gathered in his inter¬
view with datus and others.

Next: Mindanao


INDANAO is one member of the Philippine family of islands
which has been consistently sick, so to speak, and just as con¬
sistently neglected. Here is an island that can more than double the
present income of the national government. But neglect and indif-
ference in Manila has even resulted in the penetration of the island
by aliens. Rich tracts of agricultural lands have to lie idle. Its tim¬
berlands have hardly been touched. The extent of its mineral re¬
sources is not even known. Its commerce is insignificant consi¬
dering the size of Mindanao and its possibilities.
Yes, there have been attempts to do something about Minda¬
nao. Now and then, alarming reports of alien domination of some
industries in Mindanao had resulted in hurried investigations
mostly by men from the lawmaking body. As far as results are
concerned, nothing concrete has been achieved. The investigation
trips from Manila to Mindanao have turned into no more than
pleasure junkets.
Last week the President announced that he is turn¬
ing his attention to the solution of the so-called Mindanao


problem. Will he be more successful than the others who
have tried their hands at it?
The President will be if he will stick to his present idea that
what Mindanao needs more than anything else is a good system
of highways and railroads. It is understood the President is con-
sidering the appointment of Manager Jose Paez of the Manila Rail¬
road to study the feasibility of building a railroad in Mindanao.
Settlers refuse to go to Mindanao in substantial num¬
bers because without good roads or railroads there is no
future for a farmer there. Vast quantities of farm pro¬
ducts can be produced in Mindanao, it is true, but of what
value will they be to those who raise them if they cannot
be transported to the markets and there sold?
ran
The President has correctly analyzed the Mindanao problem.
But can he effect the solution his analysis indicates is the only
one feasible?

Osmena Opens Gate
Of Carnival City


In the presence of many government officials and prominent men in business,
Vice President Sergio Osmena onened the carnival city last Saturday afternoon.
He may he seen above (third from the left) cutting, with a Moro barong, the rib-
bon stretched across the main entrance of the carnival city.


YIVHOUSANDS including those
who poured into the city
I from the suburbs and the
provinces lined the streets last
Saturday afternoon to view the
opening parade marking the inaug¬
uration of the carnival season.


Vice President Sergio Osmena,
instead of President Quezon who
was kept busy by official duties,
formally opened the gates of the
carnival city and inaugurated, at
the same time, the Third National
Agricultural Exposition.


President Quezon, however, in¬
spected the carnival city at 11:30
Sunday morning. Accompanied by
Secretary Eulogio Rodriguez and
Director-General Arsenio Luz and
other carnival officials, he made a
tour of the grounds and also visited
the agricultural and commercial ex¬
position. The President showed
great interest in the exhibits, and
stated that he had a plan regarding
the exposition which will give the
public the most benefit.
Fifteen floats that participated
in the parade were awarded prizes.
They were: Most artistic, first prize,
Ang Tibay; second prize, Bureau of
Printing. Most original, Trading
Center, Bureau of Commerce; most
allegorical, Elpo Shoe Co., Alviz
Tailoring; most carnivalistic, Pris¬
cilla Products and P. Tolentino;
most typical, Rosa Soliman beauty
parlor; most symbolic, Zamora
Drug Store; best advertising float,
H. C. Damo; best commercial, Ma¬
buhay shoe store, and Getz Broth-
ers.
The National Business School


was awarded the prize for the best
float; De Luxe Academy, best fash-
ion school; Ateneo, best boy scout
troop; and Troop No. 152, best pio¬
neer troop.
The area of the carnival city is
much bigger this year, and it was
estimated that some 70,000 persons
attended the first day of the fair
without any overcrowding. Billi¬
ken ball, held last Saturday night,
was colorful, and dancing lasted
until morning. Miss Natividad
Ortanez, for wearing the most ori¬
ginal Nepa costume, was awarded a
prize.
Visitors' Ball and Miss Radio
Night at the auditorium, were held
last Sunday and Monday evenings,
respectively. Other nights at the
carnival follow:
Tuesday, February 18th, Procla¬
mation ball; Wednesday, Feb. 19th,
Bohemian ball; Thursday, Feb.
20th, Coronation ball; Friday, Feb.

February 20,


¡HEN the United States replaced Spain in the Philippines, the change effected is decidedly more than merely political: a change
W in government. The change, in fact, ushered in a revolution in political, economic, social, and even religious ideas. Only a
few of the old concepts have remained with a semblance of their old selves. The rest have completely given way to the impact of
new thoughts and ideas. And in no place than the Filipino home has the clash between the old and new concepts been more violent.
Corporal punishment, for instance, used to be a very definite part of home discipline. Children, of the poor or the rich, were
soundly spanked for bad breaches: the old idea of discip ine called for it. But now, many a parent has wondered if discipline cannot
be better enforced with the elimination of corporal punishment. Modern education, seconded by the ideas of many psychologists,
has frowned upon the rod, and many parents are moderns or like to believe they are. Hence the obvious decline of the prestige of
corporal punishment in the enforcement of home discipline.
How far, really, has corporal punishment been abandoned? We have made inquiries, not exhaustive perhaps, but decidedly im¬
pressive considering that national figures figured in this inquiry. The results obtained are startling—it should be, at least, to mo¬
dern parents.


Magistrates Spank Their Children
“Parental authority must be im¬
pressed upon the children to make
them lead straight lives,” Supreme
Court Justice Anacleto Diaz said,
when the subject
of spanking was
broached u po n
him. “My father
made me what I
am by the proper
use of the rod.
You would not be¬
AN
lieve it, but he ne¬
justice A. Diaz ver smiled at me
until I was about to become a law¬
yer; that was how stern he was
with us. So when it was my turn
to be a father, I applied the same
discipline to my children, believing
that if it had worked with me, it
would work with them. I applied
the belt once in a while on them—


and with good results.”
Justice Diaz was born in La
Union and reared there in the
traditional Ilocano discipline. In
the llocos a child is often compared
to a pot-in-the-making: he needs
plenty of whacks to put him into
shape.
“I never gave my children much
leeway,” he added, “until they went
to the university. When my boys
were studying at the Ateneo I went
to the extreme of furnishing rat-
tan rods to some of their teachers,
with the request that they use them
on my children if they did not be¬
have.”
Of the living seven children of
Justice Diaz three are successful
professionals now: one lawyer, one
physician, and another (a girl) a
professor in one of the local univ¬
ersities.
“I never abused my parental

“And another thing. No
said.
children can respect their parents
if the latter quarrel in their pre¬
sence. My children never heard me
and their mother quarrel."
Another Justice of, the Supreme
Court said he certainly spanks his
children. “I do not believe that
spanking should be abandoned;
there are children who cannot be
straightened otherwise.”
Court of Ap¬
peals Judge Ma¬
riano Albert, who
has raised as fine
children as one
could wish for, is
like his colleagues
of the bench in
I
believing that lay-
Jadge M. Albert ing t h e child
across the knees should not be done
away with. “I never used the whip,
though, with my children," he said.
“The slipper is good enough. And
I whipped my children only when"
not angry. And I always managed
to make them realize that the pun¬
ishment was directed at their
faults, not at them. When the child
reaches about ten years old, though,
spanking should be stopped. By
that time he knows what is right
and what is wrong, and persuasion


Asst. Dir. Rustia


can win him.”
Does Not Spank At All
“No, I never spanked my chil¬
dren at all,” Director Teodoro Ka¬
law of the National Library said,
when asked if he believed in the
old-fashioned spanking. “It is
barbaric and as custom generally
among lower classes. With my
children I used to correct misbeha¬
viour by giving paternal advice and
relating anecdotes about great men
and women. Or else we punished
them by decreasing their allowan-
ces or preventing them from going
to the movies for one or two weeks.”
An American lady teaching in a
local university and married to a
Filipino confessed that she has
never spanked her child and hoped
she never would.
Asks For Explanation First
“I have never spanked my child
before getting an explanation,"
Cirilo B. Perez, chief of the scien¬
tific library division of the bureau
of science, said. “For example,
when I recently found my boy
smoking in his locked room, I asked
first why he did it, and receiving
an unsatisfactory explanation, ad¬
ministered to him the necessary

How Long Will The
Vice Campaign Last?
Drive Effective So Far


EO effective has been the
 drive against vice in a most
all vice-ridden sections of
the country that many have start-
ed asking how long the people
will endure the blessings of this
campaign. Will the results of the
present drive be permanent or
merely temporary?
No chief executive in the past
has had perhaps the same wides¬
spread cooperation of all the
agencies of the government, and
of the public, as President Quezon
is having in this campaign. No
chief executive has also expressed
himself against all existing forms
of vice here than the present occu¬
pant of Malacanang. But, the peo¬
ple ask, will the drive be a per¬
manent one?


Jueteng paraphernalia. Will the pre¬
sent drive definitely stamp out jueteng ?


Several edicts against vice have
been handed down by the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the office
of the chief of the Philippine con-
stabulary in the past. The public
is aware of where such drives have
ended. Will the present campaign
be any better? However, so far,
the drive seems headed for big
things.
In Pasay, Rizal, war against vice
was declared by the municipal
board in the form of a resolution
approved by that body last Feb-
ruary 6th. A similar resolution
was also passed in Malabon, Rizal,
where the municipal president, Teo-
filo C. Santos, was suspended by
the Department of the Interior
pending investigation of a series of
charges against him in connection
with the anti-vice campaign.
In Dagupan, Pangasinan, last
week, the crack vice-squads of the


town pounced on reputed gambling
joints, rounded up sixteen persons.
Provincial Commander Margarito
S. Torralba sent a circular to all
chiefs of police of the 46 municipal¬
ities of the province, instructed
them to run down all kinds of
gambling, gave them a “dead-line"
for breaking up all jueteng joints
in their respective towns.
In Capas, Tarlac, more than one
hundred jueteng collectors who are


Gen. JOSE DE LOS REYES
He directs the campaign against vice.


dependent upon jueteng for their
means of livelihood are reported to
be "in trouble.” Police and army
officers are making the place
too hot for them. To show that
he means business. Captain Si¬
son, provincial commander of Tar¬
lac, issued a circular instructing all
municipal presidents and chiefs of
police of the 17 towns of Tarlac to
watch suspected jueteng joints.
Laguna, known as the vice center

Survey Board To Tackle Reorganization---National
Economic Council To Work On Economic Problems


Miguel Unson, former secvetary at
finance: was appointed chairman of the
Survey Board.
great ambition of President
Manuel L. Quezon, who has
Ano political reelection to
look up to, is to see the Philippine
government as an integral whole
comprising a vast business organi¬
zation, run with the greatest of
simplicity, economy, and efficien¬
cy. Another desire is to build up
a stable economic structure, one
that can ably supply the people
with the essentials of ordinary
existence, and provide them like¬
wise with opportunities to make
a decent livelihood.
The first meant steady retrench-
ment in government expenditures
to which government officials, as
evinced in the past, have always
been opposed. The second is more
difficult. It meant, as President
Quezon said, leadership “to estab¬
lish proper relationship between
our economic activities and our
national needs, correlate produc¬
tive energy with labor, capital,
and credit facilities, and direct the
wise utilization of our natural re¬
sources—all with the view of secur¬
ing the well-being of the people.”
To carry through his pet pro¬
jects, he had the National Assembly
pass Commonwealth Acts Nos. 2
and 5. He now has complete powers
to reorganize the government, from
January to June of this year, and
to create the national economic
council, the body to establish the


country’s economic and industrial
policies.
Thus, armed with acts Nos. 2 and
5, President Quezon created the
Government Survey Board and the
National Economic Council last
Friday. The first is composed of
three members, as required by law;
the second of only eleven, although
the law placed a maximum of fif-

Trinidad and Jose Paez, former col¬

members.
The NEC is temporarily headed
by Antonio de las Alas, secretary of
finance. The members are: Eulogio
Rodriguez, Secretary of Agricul¬
ture and Commerce; Vicente Car¬

Tp ENDERED antiquated by
the progress of the times,
IWthe administration of jus¬
tice in the Philippines has often
been dubbed anachronistic and
inefficient. This deplorable con¬
dition in our legal system has
been forcefully pointed out by
former Judge Guillermo Guevara
in his article, “Our Anachronis¬
tic and Inefficient Judicial Sys¬
tem,” which appeared in last
week’s issue of  .
He mentioned that the processes
of pleading, practice, and proce¬
dure in our courts of justice are
too cumbersome and slow. Fre¬
quently, Judge Guevara contends, it
takes as long as five or ten years
to dispose of cases.
To remedy this, the Supreme
Court passed a resolution last Sat¬
urday empowering Associate Jus¬
tice Claro M. Recto to prepare a
draft of rules to govern court pro¬
cedure. These rules will apply uni¬
formly to all courts of the same


ization of salaries, elimination of
unnecessary personnel; combining
positions and reducing salaries, and
whatever is necessary to effect eco¬
nomy and efficiency in the govern¬
ment service.
The National Economic Council
has P150,000 at its disposal. The
council shall advise the government
on economic and financial ques¬
tions, "including the improvement
of existing industries and the pro¬
motion of new ones, diversifica¬
tion of crops and production, ta¬
riffs, taxation, and such other mat-
ters as may from time to time be
submitted to its consideration by

ERY WOMAN


TEWENTY-YEAR-OLD Nieves
Marcelo better known as
 “the woman who did not eat
for two years,” left the Philip-
pine General Hospital last Fri¬
day, cured of her strange malady
—the most freakish of its kind
ever recorded here and probably
among the most unusual in the
world.
Only about 19 kilos of skin and
bones when she was brought all
the way from Cagayan to the
Phi ippine General Hospital last
September 22nd, Nieves Marcelo
weighed 39 kilos when she left—a
gain of 20 kilos in 20 weeks! And
she could eat again, walk again,
and was as normal as she was be¬
fore the strange malady which is
called “hysteria” gripped her.
Did Not Eat For Two Years
According to all available in¬


formation gathered from the pa¬
tient, her husband, and others who
were, with her at the time of her
illness, and Dr. Garcia Rotea who
was the first to take charge of
the girl, she had apparently taken
no food for at least two years.
"If at all,” stated Drs. Wenceslao
Vitug, Ananias Chavez, and Gon¬
zalo Austria, who took charge of
the patient at the hospital and stu¬
died her history, "she probably
had been given small doses of li¬
quid food such as milk, by moisten¬
ing her lips. At any rate, she did
not receive any nourishment for
several months at a stretch.”
Many would argue that such
small amounts of food could not
have been sufficient to sustain


could not force food into my
mouth because my throat would
choke. But my mind was perfect-
ly clear and I knew what was
going on around me, heard every¬
thing spoken, saw people and ob¬
jects within the range of my eyes.
But I felt a numbness in my limbs,
a heaviness in my head, and I
could sleep only one hour a day.”
This strange condition set on
her in 1931, the patient said.
“My first and only child who was
born that year,” she said, “died
when it was only seven days. I
was so overwhe med with sorrow
that I did not want to eat, just
cried. I did not feel any hunger
and I refused to be fed."
But her illness had a more re¬

life in a normal human being. For
a normal human being, yes; but
in this particular instance, the pa¬
tient was not normal. “Hysteria,
especially in a state of trance,"
the three physicians explained,
“slows down the physiologic pro¬
cesses of a human being; that is to
say, cuts down the amount of food
needed, the movements of the mus¬
cles, the elimination of waste prod-
ucts, etc. Sometimes the physio¬
logic processes of some organs stop
altogether. What the patient
could have taken from food, she
took from her stored fat and mus¬
cles. Hence her extreme emacia¬
tion.
Animals when they hibernate
can live for long stretches of time
without food or drink. Snakes can
also live without anything for
months and even years. It is be¬
lieved that a person suffering from
hysteric trance reverts to the an¬
cestors of the race—that is, if you
believe in evolution—and duplicate
the condition in lower animals.
Laid Up In Bed
“When I was confined in bed in
the province,” she said, "I could
move only my eyes. I did not feel
any desire to eat or drink. They


mote background, according to the
doctors. It seems her family,
being in financial straits, forced
her to marry 17-year-old Amado
Borquillo in 1930. She was only
15 years old then, the oldest of
the ten children in the family.
Shortly after the marriage she
showed signs of dizziness and
coldness in the extremities. The
death of her child served only to
snap a weakened thread, as it
were.
Patient Flees From Reality
Dr. Austria explained that the
disease has no organic basis and
is caused by, a psychical shock
which shakes an unstable nervous
system off its balance. In the
process of readjustment, the pa¬
tient tries to flee from reality
and often takes refuge in illness.
In this particular instance, star¬
vation is the form of “illness"
chosen by the patient subcon¬
sciously. No amount of persua¬
sion could make her eat. Other
cases of hysteria manifest them¬
selves in the patient’s suddenly
becoming blind or deaf—and just
as suddenly become normal again.
In fact, hysteria can imitate any

Graduates And Students Show
Failings Education Fails To
Remedy


EHERE was a time when the
college graduate, and even
A the student himself, whether
he be in the grades or in college,
had considerable prestige. He was
something of a hero, respected,
and emulated.
But that was long ago. The col¬
lege graduates these days, let alone
mere students, are frankly and
severely criticized for their short¬
comings. It seems to study and
graduate are no longer enough.
More and more the public in gen¬
eral is expecting students and
graduates to mean something, more
than merely a warehouse, as it
were, for second-hand information.
Typical of the criticism concern¬
ing so-called educated young peo¬
ple are the following given by a
number of prominent persons.
They are interesting as they
should, at least, serve to focus
thought on the inadequacy of the
present educational system.

Self-Reliance Missing
Assemblyman Maximo Kalaw,
former dean of the College of Lib-
eral Arts, U. P., believes that self-
reliance is not strong, if not ab¬
sent, in a great many college grad¬
uates. They are for the most part
unable to stand on their own feet
and are constantly floundering
about for help.
“Lack of proper adjustment in
our social structure, a defective
educational system, and the easy¬
going ways of our generation," said
Assemblyman Kalaw, “have made
them, to a regrettable extent, de¬
pendent on their parents."
Assemblyman Kalaw pointed out
that society has conformed to the
individual, instead of the individual
conforming to society. The college¬
bred leader does what he pleases,
others think it the vogue and they
follow. What they do, however, are
not lastingly beneficial for them;
their doings are more in the nature
of social pleasures, not achieve¬
ments that will give them some¬
thing solid to lean on in the future.
Contrary To Expectations
In the evening of his life, a fa¬
ther has turned bitter against his
offspring. They are, he said, college
educated; yet they turned out the
exact opposite of what he had ex¬
pected them to be. To him they ap-
pear wayward and headstrong. They
make him feel they know every¬
thing, and he, nothing. They ruth-
lessly score the classic advice of
parents, underrate his opinion in
family matters, and plainly show
to him that he is, to say the least,
cut of date. This father believes
now he should have supplemented
the school education of his children
with a great deal of old-fashioned
spanking.
“Whether they still lack some¬
thing or not should not worry par¬
ents. After giving their children
all the educational benefits they
can, parents should not worry about
them anymore,” Teopisto Guingona,
director of the bureau of non-Chris¬


tian tribes, stated.
“The parents have done their al¬
lotted share,” he added. “If there
is anything lacking, the children
must supply it. That is the trou¬
ble with parents; they keep chil-
dren under parental care too long.
I always say, give them latitude
and they will seek means to be use¬
ful. If they hang themselves, that


is their business, and not the par¬
ents’ lookout."
Wrong Perspective
“The matter with our student
population," declared Dr. Rosa Se¬
villa de Alvero, directress of the
Instituto de Mujeres, "is that they
take up education with the wrong

law has badly scared many peo¬
ple. The sugar and coconut in¬
dustries, for instance, will be so
adversely affected, so it is
claimed, that they will languish
and die. But even if this calami¬
ty should come to pass, could not
some other products be raised
instead of sugar and coconuts?
They may not prove as profit¬
able, perhaps, but they may at
least make up for part of the
lost profits.
That this is possible is shown
by the experience of Isabela
province as told by Mr. Francis¬
co Bandong in the following
article. Tobacco used to be the
only product of this province,
and it was enough when the
price of leaf tobacco was high.
But the price of tobacco fell
and after a near panic among
the people, they thought of
raising other crops, and now
Isabela is on the way to becom¬
ing one of the biggest rice-pro¬
ducing provinces.
FrHE province of Isabela has
chief y been known for its
A tobacco, and no wonder. For
it has been the main product of
the province, a product which
used to absorb practically all the
people’s attention. The tobacco
industry so completely dominated
popular interest in the province
that it not only affected econo¬
mics and society, but also deter¬
mined even the location of com¬
munities. It drew settlements and
cultivation to the river banks
where the soil is most suitable to
tobacco culture and kept the
vast plains, unsuited to that plant
but otherwise fertile, unoccupied
and uncultivated. A look at a
map of Isabela will show that the
towns follow the course of the Ca¬
gayan River. This is because the


river banks are not only suited to
tobacco, but because the river it¬
self once afforded the only means
by which the product might be
exported to markets. It gave the
province an era of prosperity and
the name "Isabela de Oro.”
The former good price of tobacco
excluded the cultivation of other
crops, except corn the planting of
which did not conflict with that of
tobacco. Every inch of arable
ground suited to tobacco was de¬
voted to that crop. Rice, fruit
trees, and even vegetables found no
place in Isabela farms. It was
more profitable to import them
even at exhorbitant prices than to
cultivate them on tobacco ground.
For tobacco sold high and more of
it should be grown. At any rate,
there was corn to subsist on if no
other cereal could be secured from
without. As a matter of fact, corn
was the chief food of the people.
Rice was but secondary. All of
this because of the mighty tobacco.


Then came the fall in the price
of leaf tobacco, a fall which has per¬
sisted for years up to the present.
At first there was a near panic.
So accustomed were the people to
imported commodities for subsist-
ence that with the enormous de-
crease in the proceeds from their
crops, they found there was not
enough to live on. They turned to
their corn but found, to their dis¬
may, that they could not subsist on
it alone. They needed vegetables,
fruits, coffee, sugar, and rice be¬
sides. Slowly but inevitably they
realized the necessity of raising
these necessities in their own farms
in addition to tobacco. They began
growing vegetables, fruit trees, and
sugar-cane. They increased their
production each year and soon there
was enough of these for the needs
of the province. Tobacco remains
the major crop, but it is no longer
the sole produce. However, corn
still is the principal food.
Immigrants Pour In
Then another factor set in to
change further the state of things.

y HEN writers enthuse about
Mindanao and dub it the
V
“Land of Promise", they
probably are not aware of the
fact that Mindanao is not the only
place in this country having any
promise at all. There is the pro¬
vince of Isabela, for example, the
town of Santiago in Isabela, par¬
ticularly. For this town, these
days when deficits are the rule
in the finances of provincial gov¬
ernments, is very much on the
black side of the ledger and is, to
use a trite expression, progressing
by leaps and bounds.


Population and Income


A decade or so ago, Santiago was
very sparsely populated. There
were only some 8,500 socially, eco¬
nomically, and politically backward
citizens as compared to its present
population of 25,000 civic-spirited
and progressive souls. With refer¬
ence to income, it had annually
₱10,000 as compared to the encour¬
aging amount of P17,585 for 1935.
The continuous and rapid immig-
ration into the Cagayan Valley
greatly accounts for this surpris¬
ing progress of a once backward
town. The town is so densely pop-
ulated now that practically every
inch of soil is owned by stalwart
agricultural pioneers.


Commercial Progress
A few years ago, only a couple
of Filipino owned sari-sari stores
existed. The inhabitants had to
journey to near-by towns to buy
the more valuable commodities.
But such is no longer the case. Big

Just as Koreg was a
dagger pointed at the very
heart of Jepan, the Phil¬
ippines will be in the hands
of the Japanese, and point¬

The following dispatch from London,
dated February 9th, seems to sustain the
point raised in the following article thet
Great Britain is not going to risk loss of
any of her present culonies:
“It was reliably learned to-day
that the British government is for-
mulating a rearmament plan neces¬
sitating the expenditure of $1,509,-
000,000 during the next three
years.
“It was understood that the gov-
ernment is determined to extri¬
cate the United Kingdom and the
Empire from a position wherein it
is open to attack by marauding na¬
tions with colonial ambitions.
“The Far Eastern situation and
Japan’s designs create another
knotty problems, for Britain’s fo¬
neign officers, who are unable to
ignore the opinion of Japanese mi¬
litarists who believe that Britain is
a decadent nation, incapable of
protecting Hongkong and Singapore
against a Japanese attack.”


FTER the many articles that
have already been published
Aconcerning the certainty of
Japan’s stepping over and taking
possession of this country the mo¬
ment the United States ceases to be
sovereign power here, it will seem
the height of absurdity to ask:
Will Japan Take the Philippines?
For the authors of these articles
are so sure Japan will grab the Is¬
lands that the average reader for¬
gets that these authors, however
sure they may appear, are advan¬
cing no more than assumptions.
The general supposition is that
Japan needs the Philippines because
of her fertile, uncultivated tracts
of land and vast supply of raw
materials. Japan, so it is claimed,
certainly will take the Philippines
because she has taken Formosa,
Korea, Manchuria, and is right now
intriguing to get another slice off

North China. And has not Japan
only recently withdrawn from the
London naval conference because
England and the United States have States, and Australia will be.
refused to give her naval equality?
And why is Japan insistent upon
naval equality? Among other things
to get the Philippines.
Islands Desirable
It is easy enough to believe that
pines. Which country will not want
the Islands with its fertile, idle
lands and vast natural resources?
But it seems to this writer that it
is not the question of whether Jap- an, the Philippines will be in the
an does or does not like to take the
Philippines which is important.
The question is: Will and can Jap-
an take the Philippines? It does
not necessarily follow, in the opi¬
nion of this writer, that because
Japan sees in these islands great
wealth she will immediately annex
them. And this author begs to be
permitted a few assumptions in
support of his contention that Jap¬
an will not likely, even if she wishes
to, grab the Philippines.
The Filipinos, of course, will not
be able to defend their country
against such a powerful nation as
Japan. The United States will not
likely risk a war with Japan just
to help the Filipinos keep their
country. Why then cannot and will
not Japan get the Philippines?
Western Powers In The Way
A glance at the map of the Far
East (refer to map on this page)
ought to help make clear just why
Japan will not and cannot take the
Philippines, barring accidents. Note
that west of the Philippines is
French Indo-China. Directly south
are Borneo, English and Dutch
ewned, and the Netherland Indies.
To the southwest are the Federated
Malay States and British Malaya.
Farther south is Australia. Imagine
Japan in control of the Philippines.
Imagine further a formidable Jap-
anese naval and air base in the
Philippines. And it should not be
very difficult to understand just
how uncomfortable the French in


Indo-China, the Dutch in Borneo
and the Netherlands Indies, and the
English in Borneo, Federated Malay
It will be remembered that Jap-
an fought Russia in 1904 to pre¬
vent Russian annexation of Korea.
Korea in the hands of a powerful
nation like Russia, so Japan rea¬
soned, would be a dagger pointed
at the very heart of Japan. Sub¬
Japan wants to have the Philip- sequently Japan annexed Korea so
the dagger could be permanently
eliminated.
Just as Korea was a dagger
pointed at the very heart of Jap¬
hands of the Japanese, and pointed
at the very heart of Western pos¬
sessions in the Far East. Unless,
of course, England, the Nether-
lands, and France are willing to re¬
tire in the near future from the
Orient and abandon their Far East¬
ern colonies, it is no more logical
to believe that the Western coloniz¬
ing powers in Asia will permit
Japan to camp on the very front

door of their colonies, so to speak,
than to believe the United States
will complacently allow Japan, Eng¬
land or France to annex Cuba or
Mexico.
Will Japan Be Opposed?
Will England, the Netherlands,
and France oppose the annexation
of the Philippines by Japan?
They will. Colonizing powers do
not easily give up their colonies and
do not usually jeopardize them by
exposing them to unnecessary dan-
ger. The present attitude of Eng-
land in the current Italo-Ethiopian
conflict is proof of this. Let no one
be fooled that England is champion¬
ing the cause of Ethiopia because
Ethiopia is a weak nation being
bullied by a powerful one. Eng¬
land is prepared to go to war and
embroil Europe and even the whole


England is prepared to ga to war to
prevent Italy from obtaining full control
of Ethiopia. For Italy in Ethiopia is a
menace to British interests in Africa.
Above is a map of a portion of Africa
showing how Italy menaces England in
Africa.


world in war to prevent Italy from
obtaining full control of Ethiopia.
For Italy in Ethiopia is a men¬
ance to British interests in Africa.
A glance at a map of Africa (see
map on this page) will show why
England is determined to keep
Italy from obtaining full control of
Ethiopia. England controls the
richest portions of the Dark Con-
tinent, and what is more import-
ant, the bulk of British possessions
in Africa forms a continuous strip
from Egypt in the north to the
Union of South Africa in the
south.
Imagine, then, Italy in Ethiopia.
There, Italy cannot only divert the
waters in Lake Tsana from the
Blue Nile and thus destroy the fer¬
tile cotton lands of the Anglo¬
Egyptian Sudan, but can push west¬
ward and cut the continuous Brit¬
ish African territory in two, say, at
Uganda.
Italy may not immediately en¬
croach upon British interests in
Africa after gaining control of
Ethiopia, but Ethiopia in the pos¬
session of Italy will strengthen


Italian position in Africa tremen¬
dously. Eritrea and Italian Somali¬
land are practically barren wastes
separated from each other by the
French Somaliland and the Brit-
ish Somaliland. Ethiopia in the
hands of Italy will not only unite


Eritrea and Italian Somaliland
but make Italian African colo¬
nization pay materially. The high-
lands of Ethiopia are habitable
by white men and the rich Ethio¬
pian natural resources: oil, miner¬
als, arable lands, will furnish Italy


with a great deal of the raw mate¬
rials she needs. The development
of Ethiopia by Italy will definitely
establish Italy as a first class pow¬
er, practically independent of other
countries for her economic needs,

UEBORA SHOOE
NOT BE AOMASLLEM
Government Needs Money Collected From It -
Shifting Tax Burden To Others Unjust
By JOSE E. COLLADO, M. A. (Taxation, University of California)


Assemblyman Nuyda: one of the
sponsors of the bill abalishing the cedula
fax.


T has been said that power as
well as danger lies in freedom.
A Hence, too much self-govern¬
ment may sometimes kill the real
purpose of a democratic form of
government. Current events in
the Philippines may prove this to
be the case, especially, if some of
our budding political economists
are left alone to their devices.
Take the big noise in connection
with our tax reform for instance.
At present a bill is pending before
the National Assembly to abolish


the cedula tax. Sponsored by As¬
semblymen Buendia, Maramba, Ra¬
ma, Magsalin, Nuyda, Sandoval,
Celebrado, and Alzate, it cannot
even be called original. It has been
copied from the Diokno-Carag bill
of 1934. Even their explanatory
arguments are not new, showing
that no additional study has been
attempted by the sponsors who
have at their disposal P24,000 an¬
nually to pay qualified researchers
to do the necessary work.
Poll Tax Not Wrong In Principle
It is not pleasant to pay taxes.
However, if a tax yields a good re¬
venue, it is not right to abolish it
simply for the sake of lightening
the tax burden. Why? Because a
reform of that sort, as most writ-
ers on taxation agree, is nothing
more than a selfish move resulting
from class conflict which no gov-
ernment has yet satisfactorily
solved.
To naive and ambitious political
“taxticians” the poll tax question
is a very perplexing one. For this
reason any tax reform should not
be taken without adequate and
systematic study. We must bear in
mind that economic and political
conditions in the United States
must not be seriously taken as a
basis of comparison. As Doctor
Davison of the University of Cal¬


ifornia pointed out, the strongest
reason that prompted some states
to abolish cedula tax was the poor
collection, reaching to practically
nothing in those states, while the
cost of administration was tremen¬
dously high. In short, the poll tax
as now recognized by practical
writers on public finance is not
wrong in principle if it is produc¬
tive of results as is the case in the
Philippines.

F the ten appellate judges ap-
pointed by President Quezon
recently to the Court of Ap-
peals, Judge Ricardo Paras, Jr., is
perhaps the least known.
Judge Paras’ appointment was a
surprise even to many who are
intimate with those in judicial cir¬
cles. While names were being shuf¬
fled for the eleven positions created
by Act No. 3 of the National As¬
sembly, and newspapers were daily
giving out the names of candidates
and probable appointees, the name
of Judge Ricardo Paras was con¬
sistently left unmentioned.
Not even once did his name
appear in the newspapers.
Unassuming and anxious
to keep himself out of the
spotlight, Judge Paras has
managed to escape publici¬
ty. This is perhaps why
only a few people knew
much about him when his
name was included in the
ist of those named to the
Court of Appeals. He came
from the small island of
Marinduque and was the
presiding judge in the first
tranch of the Pangasinan
ourt of first instance at
the time of his elevation to
ne Court of Appeals. He
tarted in the government
ervice as a mere helper:
mnounting insects in the
Lureau of science. It is a
ir cry from mounting in¬
ects on cardboards to the
ourt of Appeals, but he
egotiated the distance.
Judge Ricardo Paras be¬
ngs to a prominent family
Boac, Marinduque. The
ther of Judge Paras was
rovincial governor of Ta¬
abas and Marinduque,
ien combined as one prov¬
ce, from 1901 to 1906.
Judge Paras was born on
February 17, 1891, so that
le celebrated his forty-
ifth birthday only three
lays ago. “Incidentally,"
le remarked the other day,
'this is one of my happiest birth-
lays.” Judge Paras is the son of
Ricardo Paras, Sr., and Andrea
Mercader, both of Boac, Marindu¬
que. Ricardo Paras, Sr., the pred¬
cessor of President Quezon in the
office of governor, retired only
three years ago as clerk in the cen¬
tral office of the Philippine con-
stabulary.
Judge Paras studied in the public
elementary school of Boac. After
completing his seventh . his
father buought him
where yOung Ricardo
Tayaba!, High School
could finish his secon
Tayabas, he moved to
was graduated at the


School in 1909, together with Judge
Montemayor, Dean Leandro Fer¬
nandez, Dr. M. Arguelles, and Mi¬
guel Cuaderno.
But young Ricardo Paras’ coming
to Manila was not without purpose.
Although his parents could very
well afford to support him in his
studies, he wanted to work his way
through college. He obtained a job
as helper in the bureau of science.
At the same time, he studied in the
Manila High School.
His first job in the government
was not a "big job," according to


Judge Paras. Besides, there could
be nothing more monotonous than
mounting dead butterflies. But
young Ricardo was as eager and as
enthusiastic about his work then as
he is now about his present one. It
is his belief that a job however un¬
important can be a source of enthu¬
siasm.
At first he wanted to become a
doctor and he enrolled in the then
Philippine School of Medicine near
the Pert ". Artey of e semester,
not like the
ol. He stu¬

Justice Malcolm’s class was later
transferred to the University of
the Philippines and Judge Paras
was admitted into the state univer¬
sity as a junior student. He was a
member of the first graduating
class (Class of 1913) of the college
of law, University of the Philip-
pines, and had as classmates for¬
mer Justice Vickers, former Speak¬
er Roxas, the Hilados, Dean Con¬
rado Benitez, Dean Espiritu, and a
great many others who are now
prominent in public life. As a law
student, he worked as typ-
ist for the late Amzi B.
Kelly, a colorful Manila
lawyer, and learned the
practical side of the profes¬
sion in the Kelly law of-
fice. He also worked for
some time as clerk in the
statistical division of the
bureau of customs.
Judge Paras took the bar
examinations in 1913 and
immediately practised law¬
after the result of the bar
examinations was an¬
nounced. He joined the law
firm of Ross, Lawrence, and
Block and stayed with that
firm until he ran for the
position of representative
for the second district of
Tayabas and Marinduque
in 1919. He was elected
and as representative he se¬
cured the separation of Ma¬
rinduque from Tayabas.
After the completion of
his term, he became assist-
ant attorney of the Manila
Railroad Company.
In February, 1924, Atty.
Paras was appointed dis¬
trict judge of Samar. He
stayed in that province five
years. In March, 1929, he
was transferred to Ilocos
Sur and Abra and stayed
in that judicial district un¬
til January, 1933. He was
next designated to preside
over the first branch of the
Pangasinan court of first
instance, a designation he held un¬
til he was appointed to the Court
of Appeals.
Judge Paras is married to the
former Miss Elisa Lardizabal of
Boac, Marinduque, and has
five
children: Edgardo, 14; Jorge, 12;
Oscar, 10; Leticia, 8; and Ricardo
III, 5.
In 1932, Judge Paras made a
pleasure trip around the world.
Residence: 678 Penafrancia.

to talk back. He kicked the boy

T was a new girl who answered
the door of the apartment, so
M of course she didn’t know who
he was, but met him instead with
a blank look of inquiry, directed
partly at the bundle he was carry¬
ing. She was a neat, red-cheeked
girl, English or Scotch probably,
and very clean and starched as to
appearance; she looked like a cap-
able sort, he thought. He wondered
how she would be with Bill.
“I am Mr. Rodney,” he said, feel¬
ing somehow a little embarrassed.
Her expression changed. “Oh,
yes, sir,” she said, and opened the
door wider. “Mrs. Rodney told me
you were expected. Won’t you come
in?” There was a broad Scotch
burr in her voice, he noticed. Well,
everyone said the Scotch made ex¬
cellent nursemaids. Evidently, too,
she had been full of curiosity to
know what he would look like, for
as she stood aside and he entered
he could feel her eyes upon him,
studying him discreetly. In the
hall she took his hat. “I am Miss
Thompson," she said abruptly, and
then, without waiting for a reply,
made a gesture toward his bundle.
“That is for him?”
“Yes,” he said, and found him-
self smiling.
She didn’t return the smile. In-
stead, she looked gravely down at
the floor for a moment and then up
at him again. "Were you thinking
of taking him out to-day, sir?” she


asked unexpectedly.
"Why, yes,” he said.
The girl hesitated. “Well,” she
said, "Mrs. Rodney wanted to ask
if you'd mind not doing so to-day,
sir. He has had a slight cold, d’ you
see, and while there isn’t any dan-
ger, Mrs. Rodney thought it would
be safer. ..” She paused again,
and above the starched collar her
face grew a trifle ruddier, but he
realized suddenly that it was only
partly because of embarrassment.
The other part was resentment and
disapproval. In her Scotch way
she just didn’t like his being there
at all. “She—she asked me to say
that she will not be home until just
in time for dinner," she went on.
"If you wouldn’t mind just staying
in with him....”
“I see,” he said. “Yes, certainly.
Has he had a doctor?” he added.
“Oh, no, sir,” the girl said quick-
ly. “There’s been no need for that,
really. He’s had only the least
hickness, in the throat mostly, and
hardly any fever. It’s just that we
didn’t want to run any risks till he
was quite well."
"I know, but—” he said. It
seemed foolish not to have a doctor


come in, if only to make sure it was
really a cold and not something else.
The girl waited for him to continue.
Then, when she saw that he wasn’t
going to, "He’s in his nursery¬
room," she said, and started brisk¬
ly ahead of him down the hall.
He had to address her back as
he followed her. “Has he been laid
up at all? In bed, I mean?'
“Oh, no, sir,” the girl said, glan¬
cing part way around. “He’s real¬
y as right as rain, you know.” She
paused a moment, and the pause
gave her next remark an added sig¬
nificance, as if she had weighed it
well before delivering it. "You may
be sure that we are giving him the
best of care, sir,” she said.
“I am sure of that,” the man said
drily, and then she was opening the
door of the nursery and waving him
into the room. “Here is Mr. Rod—
your father, come to see you, Wil¬
liam," she called, with the nurse¬
maid’s peremptory cheeriness. She
transferred her gaze to the man
for a moment, with the effect al¬
most of an admonition, before leav¬
ing the room.
Bill was on the floor over near
the window, clutching what looked

ROBERT M.
COATES
like a toy autogiro to his chest with
one hand while he tried to wind its
spring with the other. The man
felt the same sharp drag of fear
that he always felt, each time he
came there—the fear that Bill
wouldn’t welcome him, wouldn’t,
perhaps, even recognize him. “Hel¬
lo, youngster,” he said.
But Bill had turned and was look¬
ing at him calmly and imperturb¬
ably. Whatever explanation he had
worked out to account for a father
who manifested himself only on
Sunday afternoons, it seemed to
satisfy his four-year-old mind com¬
pletely. “Hello,” he said. "What
you got there? Is it for me? I
can’t go out to-day."
“I know,” the man said. He had
put down the bundle and started to
unwrap it. “You bet it’s for you,"
he said. Bill got up and came over
to watch, and as he approached, the
man ran his hand over him, touch-
ing his shoulders and then tousling
his head and then, unobtrusively,
resting his hand on his brow. There
wasn’t any fever, as far as he could
make out. And the boy looked all
right. “How’s your cold?” he asked.
“It’s all 'ight,” Bill said. He still
had trouble with some of his "r”s.
“Where would we have gone if we
had gone out?” he demanded.
“Oh, I don’t know,” the man said.
He had had plans, but there was no
point in telling about them now.
He reached out suddenly and rum¬
pled Bill’s hair again. “Next time,
we’ll have to think up something
extra good, to make up for to-day,”
he said.
Bill had jerked his head away.
At the moment he was interested
only in the bundle. "What’s in it?”
he demanded, and again the man
set to work unpacking it. When
he brought out the pilot’s suit, how-¬
ever, Billls face fell. “I’ve got a
pilot’s suit,” he said.
“Why”—the man was puzzled—
"last week you said you wanted
one."
“I guess maybe I did,” Bill ex¬
plained patiently. “But I got one
since then. Mr. Bassett gave me
one.”
The man raised his eyes in a sud-
den stare, and Bill, misinterpreting
the look, got up and started tow¬
ard his play boy in the corner. “PIl
show you,” he said, but the man
called him back.
“Never mind,” he said, and un¬
wrapping the rest of the bundle,
pulled out the second object it con¬

  Hollyiood Correspondent


UR Hollywood correspondent
tells in the following article
O of a recent attempt to inter¬
view Claudette Colbert for the be¬
nefit of   readers. He
failed to see Miss Colbert. How¬
ever, as the following article
shows, our correspondent had a
perfectly nice time touring a stu¬
dio in the company of a charming
young lady. Incidentally, (we
mean just that, incidentally, and
you will know why after reading
the article and finding Harold
Lloyd barely managed to appear in
this write-up), Mr. Morantte saw
Harold Lloyd who was at work on
“The Milky Way,” at the time of
Mr. Morantte’s visit.
(ar know whom you want to
see,” said the policeman
I who guards the main en¬
trance to the Paramount Studio
when I appeared at his window.
"Whom?” I said patronizingly.
With a suave grin he reached for
the 'phone and dialed. "Announcing
Mr. Morantte, please,” he said.
Then, "Okay, suite 61,” he ad-
dressed me, as if I didn’t know it
was the office of the charming
young lady who confronts motion
picture scribes from foreign coun¬
tries. Her name is Carroll Stroud.


As I brushed past the copper, I
said to him, “You’re quite wrong.
I’m here to see Cleopatra.” He
didn’t hear me, though; he was bu¬
sy telling Hollywood correspond-
ents from Japan and London that
the “gentleman from the Philip-
pines” was to have the booth first.
Did I feel important!
I knocked on the door at suite 61
and without waiting for a reply I
went in. “Good morning,” a pret¬
ty girl with fluffy platinum locks
greeted me. This side of Eden
nearly all the girls are blondes. And
pretty!
“Good morning,” I said, remov¬
ing my hat and closing the door be¬
hind me.
“Miss Stroud is ready to receive
you in her office,” she said curtly.
She is Miss Stroud’s new secretary.
“Thank you,” I said, and trundled
carelessly past her into Miss
Stroud’s sanctum.
“Oh, hello, hello,” Carroll herself
(with brunette hair fixed a la Ann
Harding and a red rose tucked in
her hair) greeted me warmly, ris¬
ing from her swivel chair and
stretching out a lovely hand half-
way across her desk. “How are
you?” She gracefully sank back
into her seat.
"Fine, thank you,” I replied.

“Lysol”
for feminine hygiene


The importance of using
'Lysol” in feminine hy¬
giene, which is so vital to
every woman, cannot be
over-emphasized. The
method used must be cho¬
sen withgreat care, Inmany
instances women have in¬
jured themselves seriously,
mainly due to the use of
over-caustic preparations
that irritate the membranes,
or are much too weak to
be dependable as hygienic
agents.


The universal use of "Lysol" in
hospitals where thorough and safe
disinfection is insisted upon is posi¬
tive proof of its safety and efficacy.
Surely, then, "Lysol” is correct for
normal feminine hy¬
giene. You can place
tull confidence in


“Lysol” to give your body the me-
ticulous care it requires. Lysol is sold
at all drug stores—it is never sold in
bulk—insist on the brown bottle in
the yellow carton. It comes in three
convenient sizes, is highly concen¬
trated, therefore more economical
than cheaply priced substitutes.

ARASSACR
By Lieut.-Col. E. E. WHITTINGTON


N a war anything can happen.
a massacre of prisoners who
Acannot be liberated because
they will turn enemies again, who
cannot be kept and fed because
they will starve the victors them¬
selves. And such massacres have
happened, one of the most appall¬
ing perhaps was that authorized


by Napoleon during his Egyptian
campaign, after the capture of
Jaffa. The following account by
Lieut.-Col. F. E. Whittington tells
of this massacre which cost about
3,000 prisoners their lives.
Three thousand of the garrison
of Jaffa had laid down their arms


upon a promise made by two of Bo¬
naparte’s aides-de-camp that their
lives should be spared. But the dis¬
posal of such a large number of pri¬
soners at once raised difficulties.
To release them on parole would be
useless: indeed it had come to light
that many so released at El Arish
had been found in arms among the


defenders of Jaffa. To send them
to Egypt by land would necessitate
the escort of at least a battalion,
and a battalion could not possibly
be spared. There was not sufficient
shipping to send them by sea. Fur¬
ther, the available supplies barely
sufficed for the French soldiers
themselves.
Two days after the fall of Jaffa,
Bonaparte sent a note ordering the
adjutant-general on duty “to con¬
duct all the artillerymen and other
Turks taken with arms in their
hands to the edge of the sea and
there have them shot, taking every
precaution that none should escape.”
The following afternoon the vic-
tims were driven into a hollow
square formed by the troops of
General Bon’s division. Some in¬
capacitated by wounds, were over¬
taken by the rear face of the square
and killed instantly with the bayo¬
net. The remainder were marched
to the sand-dunes southwest of the
city, where the square came to a
halt by the edge of a brackish la¬
goon. The officer in command di¬
vided the mass of prisoners into
squads and each squad was marched
off by a firing party to its doom.
With hardly an exception the Turks
met their end with manly courage.
Each prisoner performed his ablu¬
tions in the stagnant water, and
then in Mohammedan fashion kis¬
sing those nearest him on the lips
and heart, signalled to his execu¬
tioners that he was ready for his
end. Nearly two thousand five
hundred in all were butchered. To¬
wards the end the ammunition of

the executioners ran out. But with
bayonet and with sword the bloody
work went on. The fortitude of the
last wretched remnant of victims
broke under the strain of this
ghastly shambles. Many strove to
find shelter under a dead or dying
comrade, and there was thus formed
an awful pyramid of the living and
the dead from which blood ran
down in streams . The French sol¬
diers had to pull down the corpses
of those who had already expired
in order to strike and thrust at
those still living.

She laughed shortly. “Oh, Clau¬

California from dried cottage
cheese, gelatin, dried blood, and
other substances by Dr. Max S.
Dunn, an associate chemistry pro¬

The costly amino acids are being

volving the function and growth of
the human body.
More than fifty students are as¬

able protein is subject to careful
examination under a stereoscopic
photo-micrograph to insure its
meeting of the high standard set
for it in its manufacture.
Since the amino contains such
abundant units of the scarce pro¬

Learn Farming
With the unemployment situation
getting worse and worse and grad-
uates still hunting for white-collar
jobs, why don’t the others—who
are preparing to go to college—
study agriculture and learn farm¬
ing? Our country is essentially
agricultural, our fertile lands wide
and waiting for young, husky, will¬
ing men.
Live closer to Nature. Forsake
the city and live in provincial farms
whose innate beauty lures the heart
and brightens the mind. Out there
a family can live comfortably,
breathe the clean rural air, instead
of the kind found in a dim, crowded,
musty-smelling city accessorias.
One finds employment in the
farm. In the city a fellow waits
and waits for an opening; in the
farm, he can plant a hectare or two
of corn, raise cabbage and other
vegetables.
It is also by living in the farm
that a family may learn to eco¬
nomize and save. For although one
does not earn a monthly salary,
family expenses can be reduced to
a minimum, because the family can
practically save whatever it may
get from the sale of farm products.
Yes, why don’t other young people
take up farming?

Worthy Suggestion
  is one of my favorite
weeklies and it surely has improved
a lot since its initial bow some eight
years ago. But while you still re-
tain some of your original features
like the “Who’s Who,” the short
stories, etc., you have done away
with the “Ask Me Another” col¬
umn.
I have truly missed, as did a


great many, that valuable column
all these years. It was good and
helpful while it existed—my chief
source of many interesting and va¬
luable information told in a few,
select words. Other magazines,
realizing the importance of a ques¬
tion-and-answer column, make it a
regular feature. An example is
“Twenty Questions” in Liberty.
Why not revive  ’s "Ask
Me Another?” Your reader will
welcome its return with open arms.

We shall look into this.—Editor
Leyte Spanks Enage
For resigning without consulting
the Leyte electorate, political lead¬
ers, the people and the Leyte papers


Ssu-K'ung T'u (834-908), we are told by L. Cranmer-Byng—translator
of the poems reprinted below—in A Lute of Jide, "is perhaps the most
Chinese of the poets dealt with, and certainly one of the most philosophical.
By his subtly simple method of treatment lofty themes are clothed in the
bright raiment of poetry.”
Despondent
A gale goes ruffling down the stream,
The giants of the forest crack;
My thoughts are bitter—black as death—
For she, my summer, comes not back.
A hundred years like water glide,
Riches and rank are ashen cold,
Daily the dream of peace recedes:
By whom shall Sorrow be consoled?
The solidier, dauntless, draws his sword,
And there are tears and endless pain;
The winds arise, leaves flutter down,
And through the old thatch drips the rain.
Embroideries
IF rank and wealth within the mind abide,
Then gilded dust is all your yellow gold.
Kings in their fretted palaces grow old;
Youth dwells for ever at Contentment’s side.
A mist cloud hanging at the river’s brim,
Pink almond flowers along the purple bough,
A hut rose-girdled under moon-swept skies,
A painted bridge half-seen in shadows dim,—
These are the splendours of the poor, and thou,
O wine of spring, the vintage of the wise.
—Ssu-Kung Tu


are now vehemently criticising for¬
mer Assemblyman Francisco Enage.
As a well-known Leyteno said:
"A public man, as Enage has been.
owes his office through the ballots
and he is under contract, so to
speak, to serve his constituents in
his capacity as an elected official.
To give up his seat in the National
Assembly, in the expectation of a
judiciary appointment, is a betray¬
al of the confidence of the people
who elected him. By his resigna¬
tion, he has become a deserter from
the public duties he had sworn to
perform."
The Leyte people have commented
that Mr. Enage should have, before
he resigned, consulted his consti¬
tuency with regard to giving up
his post in the National Assembly.
They point out to the action of As¬
semblyman Manuel Roxas who has
consulted his province about its
wishes concerning the post of a de¬
partment secretary offered him.

Barrios Also Wide Awake
Who says barrio people are not
interested in current national af¬
ffairs? If they make the charge
because these provincial folk do not
publish their opinions in news¬
papers, then they are right. But
they always make their opinions
oral.
At night, or during the day, vis:
it the barrio tienda and you will see
people gathered there hearing the
barrio teacher or the teniente del
barrio disseminating the news to all
within hearing distance. One ex¬
plains in full the important events
of the day. When he has finished
his news-telling, queries of all sorts
come from all directions, and the
impromptu gathering becomes an
open forum. Even the barrio bar¬
beria, you will find, is a public de¬
bating place.
And most likely, these barrio
people when they take up current
events, will be attacking the act-
uations of incumbent public offi¬
cials, nepotism in the government,
Manila’s costly public banquets,
burdensome taxes, and an endless
variety of current topics.

OOK around you and you
will see many women who
Eare blessed with Jeisure
which they do not know how to
use.
The cry, becoming louder and
louder, that is heard from girls
and women is, "I do not have any¬
thing to do at home!”
Here in
the Philippines where housekeep¬
ing is comparatively simple, the
average housewife, especially she
who lives in the city and whose
house is equipped with many con¬
veniences, finds herself with
practically nothing to do in the
afternoons. The smaller estab¬
lishments, the smaller family,
gives the modern housewife little
to do. So she becomes bored to
death, is restless and discontented
at home. Result: she goes out to
work, if she can find a job.
While interviewing a number of
married women for an article
which appears in this issue, we
learned that one of the reasons
of many of them for working out¬
side of their homes is to have
enough to do to occupy them. One
of them explained that the city
housewife does not have as many
choices as the housewife in the
province in ways of using her lei¬
sure time. For instance, much as
she may want to indulge in the
hobby of gardening or poultry
raising, she cannot, because she
usually lives in a small apartment.


Women in the provinces who do
not have opportunities for spend¬
ing their leisure time in remune¬
rative occupations, may use it in
various ways to effect small
household economies. The house¬
wife who accomplishes this, makes
the family income go farther as if
she were earning money and con¬
tributing to it.
A small vegetable garden will
not only supply the family with
fresh vegetables every day and
iessen the expenses for food, but
also give the housewife something
to do in the afternoons. If the
lot is larger, she can raise more
vegetables than the family can
consume and preserve the rest for
future use or for sale.
A lot of fruits and vegetables
are left to rot when they are in
season because nobody buys them,
a'though they are very cheap.
The enterprising and foresighted
housewife will buy them and pre¬
serve them or prepare them into
pickles or candy. Then, when
these fruits and vegetables are
not in season or are expensive,
the family need not forego them
just because they are not avail¬
able fresh or are beyond their
means. All that the housewife
will have to do is to open a jar or
two of her preserves and serve
the contents to the family.
Governor Santiago Espiritu of
Ilocos Norte has the distinction
of being the first provincial gov-


ernor to send pensionadas in the
persons of Miss Salvacion Tubera
and Miss Felicidad Tomaneng to
the home economics division of
the bureau of science to learn
food preservation and utilization.
When these two girls return to
their province, they will teach the
women there to preserve fruits
and vegetables in time of plenty
to prevent, in the future, food
shortage that frequently occurs
in the province. The girls are
also learning such crafts as rug
making from waste materials like
torn stockings, retazos, and old
clothes; knitting, lampshade mak-
ing, and decorative painting, so
that they can teach the women in
their province to use their leisure
time in these activities.
Women of the past genera¬
tion did not get bored at home be¬
cause they always had something
to do during their leisure hours,
after cooking, cleaning the house,
and attending to the children.
The well-to-do embroidered,
painted, read, or played on the
piano to pass away the time.
Those who were not we’l-to-do
had their sewing, their weaving
or their washing. Nowadays, we
buy almost everything ready¬
made, even the hand-embroidered
napkins or handkerchiefs or we
have them made by others in-
stead of doing them ourselves. We
would rather buy the pickles than
make them ourselves.

CATCDIINA SALAD
An Attractive And Delicious Dish


Cardinal Salad


1 tin sliced beets
2 cups water
1 cup beet liquid
1 small stalk ce'ery
1 bundle gulaman
M2 cup good vinegar (cider, preferred)

a large bowl. Add to it the liquid from the
beets and the seasonings. Wet a ring mold in
cold water and then place in its bottom the
cut up celery, sliced beets, and chopped pick-
les. Pour into the mold the partly cooled
gulaman mixture. Place the mold in the re-
frigerator or in a cool place to get firm. For
serving, unmold on a large platter and garnish


with lettuce or with canned asparagus tips.
Serve with a small bowl of mayonnaise in the
center of the mold.

1 cup refined white sugar
2 tablespoons cake f'our
cup evaporated milk
The juice and rind of 1 lemon
Cream the butter and the sugar. Add the
flour, the lemon juice and the grated rind, the
well-beaten yolks of the eggs, and the milk.
Mix well. Then fold in the stiffly beaten
whites of the eggs. Pour into a glass dish, set
in a pan of water, and bake in a moderate oven
for 35 minutes. Serve this pudding cold with
whipped milk.
Macaroni Salad
1 package macaroni

Some Food Fallacies
(Proven false by Dr. E. V. MeCollum)
Is Fish A Brain Food? That fish is a
brain food is one of the most amusing of all
food fa’acies that many people believe in. This
belief is based on these facts: The brain is
rich in phosphorus. Fish is rich in phospho¬
rus too. Therefore, said an expert conclusion
jumper, fish is a brain food.
Is Aluminum Poisonous? Many people be¬
lieve that foods—particularly acid foods—
cooked in aluminum utensils become poisonous
and may cause cancer. Where is the fact? Dr.
MeCollum says that aluminum metal dissolves
fairly easily in certain strong acids used by
chemists, but the amount of acidity found in
foods has so little effect on aluminum that
there is not the slightest danger from this
source. Highly salted foods and those made
alkaline with soda, dissolve small amounts of
the metal, but this has no influence on health.
Why? For centuries, we and our ancestors
have been eating aluminum unintentionally.
All dirt and all foods exposed to dust contain
this metal. Aluminum, however, once swal¬
lowed, is treated in our systems as a foreign
substance is treated—it is not absorbed and
simply remains in the intestines until elimin¬
ated. Tomatoes and other acid foods may be
cooked in aluminum utensils with perfect
safety. The only disadvantage is that they be¬
come discolored.

ONOGRAMS, as may be

Mon tuis page have gone
modern, and we should be thank¬
ful for this. Now you can let your
fancy play freely and combine
your letters in any way ve¬


g where they
 ve placed—on handbags, on
breast pockets, on neckerchiefs,
scarves, on belts as buckles, on
the necklines of dresses as pins or
clips, on rings, etc. Many stores
in Manila sell pins or pendants
with only a letter each or rectan¬
gles that are filled up with two
or three letters of your choice.
Shopping for monograms is lots
of fun, for you are given a tray
containing letters in various sizos
and styles (block, italics, small or

The arrangement of
the letters and the sizes to be
used will depend on your initials,
of course.
Monograms for your scarf,
breast pockets, neckerchief, and
handkerchiefs, may be cut in felt
and sewed on, or they may be
embroidered w it h contrasting
threads. An ingenious young man
carved his monogram of his own
design in cork and stamps it with
indelible ink on his handkerchiefs
and on the breast pockets of his
shirts.

select two or three letters from

monogram.

grams on table and bed linens still

monogram should be from two and
a half to five inches, depending
on the size of the table. For din-
ner napkins from one to two in¬

part of the cloth whici
one of the corners of the table.
This is how it is properly located:
Place the cloth on the table as
you will use it. With a measur¬
ing stick at the edge of one corner
of the table, point it in the di¬
rection of the diagonally opposite
corner of the table. Measure
from twelve to fifteen inches
from the edge, mark this off, and
olan to place your monogram
there. Do not place the mono¬
gram in the center of the table¬
cloth because it will not be seen.
A monogram is used for identifi¬
cation as well as for adornment.
Dinner napkins are embroid¬
ered with monograms in what is
known as the “center of the side."
The modern way of folding the
napkin is this: fold the napkin
into two in the center, then into
three in the opposite way, with
the two outside squares or rect-
angles overlapping each other.
The monogram is placed on the
top of the center square or rect-
angle, with the selvage towards
you. When the napkin, folded in
this manner, is placed on the co¬
ver-plate, the monogram shows.
The tendency in placing the
monogram on a towel is towards
the left or the right side of the
end that shows when the towel is
hung on a rod. Before, mono¬
grams on towels as well as on pil¬
low-cases could not be placed ex¬
cept in the center of one of the
ends of each. A monogram on a
bed cover may also be placed in
the center of the end covering the
foot or the head of the bed, in¬
stead of in the center of the co¬
verlet itself.


At the Ieft are shown samples of madern
monograms from which you may get sug¬
gestions as to ways of combining your
initials. Note that the use of small letters
predominates. When a tall letter and tio
short ones are used, the tall letter is
usually the initial of your family name.


UNTOUCHED PAINTED TANGEE

said Dick Pow¬

They do, indeed, as millions of men will
testify. But Tangee can’t make you look
painted, because Tangee isn’t paint. Tangee
is the one and only lipstick in the world with
the magic Tangee color-change principle
that prevents that painted look.
As you apply it Tangee changes to the

pleats either in the skirt or in the blouse. The dotted frock
at the leff, which has a yoke like a collar, has pleats af the

word in chic. The fwo-piece frock at the center has pleats
in the blouse. Note the row of large, round butfons. The
two-piece frock at the right has a skirt pleated all around

Mercolized Wax
Brings Out Skin Beauty
Do you realize that just heneath that
coarse, muddy or discolored complexion
there’s an exquisitely beautiful skin of youth-
ful tint and delicacy? If you could only
bring this complexion to the surface, discard-
ing the old one! Yau can—in the easiest,
simplest, most natural manner imaginable.
Just get an ounce of pure Mercolized Wax at
any drug store, apply nightly like cold cream,
removing it mornings with warm water. The
Wax assists Nature by gradually taking off
the lingering particles of dead and half-dead
surface skin, causing no discomfort whatever.
Nothing else will accomplish such wonderful
results in so short a time. Mercolized Wax
brings out the hidden heauty of your skin.

FOOT grooming is something
that is new among us, in
I spite of the fact that we have
been going stockingless for a num¬
ber of years now. All that we have
been doing in the way of improv¬
ing the looks of our feet is to ap¬
ply brilliant polish on the nails
of our ten toes.
The feet are perhaps the most
abused and neglected parts of the
human anatomy, which should not
be the case because they are just
as useful, although not as fre-
quently seen, as the hands. Groom-
ing of the hands and of the feet
should go together, especially dur¬
ing these days when open sandals
and, during summer, zapatillas are
the vogue.
Feet cannot be beautiful if they
are not well-cared for. It is not
enough to paint the toe nails and
rouge the heels. These serve to call
attention to the feet and this is not
welcomed when the feet are not at-

tractive. The toes should be pedi¬
cured and the feet exercised just as
other parts of the body are.
The first thing to do for your
feet is to buy comfortable shoes for
them. Shoes must fit well—never
tight or loose. If you do a lot of
walking or standing, get shoes with
medium high heels in sandal or Ox¬
ford style. High heeled shoes, al¬
though attractive, are not good for
5 the health. They should be worn
as infrequently as possible, prefer¬
 ably only in the evening with even¬
ing clothes.
What you do for your hands, you
should also do for your feet. This
includes not only nightly cleansing
and massage but also exercise. The
fact that the feet are encased in
shoes most of the time is no excuse
for neglecting them.
Once a week, give your ten toes
a pedicure. This consists of the
same processes as the manicure, but
it is cal'ed that because it is applied
on the feet instead of on the hands.
First, shape the nails. We have fol¬
lewed the advice of a chiropodist


(one who cures feet ailments, as
distinguished from the pedicurist
who merely makes feet beautiful)
since we read it a long time ago
in a magazine, that the corners of
the toe nails should not be cut to
avoid in-growing nails. The nails
should be straight. File the nails,
first with the steel file and then
with the emery board.
Then soak the feet in warm,
soapy water and scrub the nails and
the callouses with a stiff brush. Do
not be too gentle when using the
brush. You will be surprised at
the amount of dead skin and dirt
that will come off.
Before we forget it: You should
extend the scrubbing with .the
brush and soapy water up to the
knees. Any beauty treatment done
on the feet should extend to the
knees as any beauty treatment done
on the hands should extend to the
elbows. Scrub your knees with a
small towel or better still, rub them
with a stone.
Rinse the feet and the legs and
knees with clear water and wipe


thoroughly dry with a towel. Then
with your orange stick, with a bit
of cotton wrapped around the end
and dipped in cuticle remover, go
around each toe nail, pushing back
the cuticle gently. It may be neces¬
sary to scrape away the dead skin
that clings to the nails. Be very
gentle in performing this operation.
Rinse the toes and dry with a to¬
wel, wiping away the removed cut¬
icle.
Apply polish on the nails, if de-
sired.
Every evening or at least twice
a week, take some of your cleans¬
ing face cream and rub it on your
toes and on the callouses, massag¬
ing it on. Wipe off the surplus
cream. Your feet will appreciate
this little attention.
If the skin on your legs tends
to be dry and scaly, the application
of cold or softening cream or even
of olive oil every night will remedy
this defect.
If you are troubled with excess
perspiration at the feet, purchase
a box of foot powder and apply it
between the toes before putting on
your stockings or your shoes.
Washing the feet daily in soapy
water will also help a little.
Here are a few exercises that

AN OLD FILIPINO CUSTOM
Up to the end of the Spanish era, when a young man wanted
to visit his lady-love on a rainy night, he would place his
clean clothes inside a bamboo tube and walk to the girl’s
house almost naked. He would put on his clean clothes as
soon as he came near or even under the house of the girl!


will benefit the feet:
To make the feet muscles sup-
ple, follow this exercise every even¬
ing: Sit on a chair or on the edge
of your bed and extend the legs
forward. Then rotate the feet,
using the ankles as pivots, without
moving the legs. Do this exercise
slowly, forcing the feet forward in
front and back.
Wriggling the toes and trying to
spread them out or as far apart
as possible is also excellent for the
feet. Do this several times during
the day whenever you have a chance.
Picking up marbles or stones on
the floor with the toes of the feet
is recommended for flat feet. Even
if you do not know if you suffer
from flat feet, do this exercise just
the same to strengthen the feet
muscles. Place about a dozen mar¬
bles or small stones on the floor
and pick them up one by one with
one foot. Then place them back on
the floor and pick them up again
one by one with the other foot.
This exercise may also be per¬
formed with a pencil or with a to¬
wel. Gather the towel under the
foot, starting with the edge nearest
your foot that is doing the exercise.
The point is to curve the underpart
of each foot as much as possible.
Walking barefooted and on tip-
toe around the room until you are
tired is also another exercise for
making the muscles of the feet
strong.

NOW!... Restore Nafural

An Antiseptic Cleansing Dental Cream That's
Bringing New Attractiveness to Millions!


There is now a way to restore the
natural whiteness and brilliance to
your teeth. It is called the Kolynos
method.
All you do is put just a half-inch
of Kolynos on a dry brush. Quickly
the antiseptic Kolynos foam reaches
every tiny crevice and fissure. Mil¬
lions of germs that cause stain, dis¬


coloration and decay are destroyed
and washed away. Soon your teeth
lose their dullness. Natural white¬
ness and brilliance are restored—your
mouth feels clean and refreshed.
Try Kolynos. Use it morning and
night and you will be delighted and
amazed at what it does.

around three hundred thousand

nothing on Hollywood, that is, as
far as glamour copy is concerned.
I was thinking of these facts
when I replied, "No.”
“A fine correspondent you are,”
said she chidingly.
“I know it,” I said to humor her.
We both laughed.
Are you very busy?” I asked
stupidly.
“Oh, not very,” she said. But
she really was. She always is busy.
On her desk was a storm of papers.
Intermittent 'phone calls broke off
our conversation.
“Then how about touring around
the lot. Maybe we’d bump into a
star from whom I might get an in¬
terview,” I suggested.
“But you are not supposed to do
that, you know. Even a holder of an
interview pass is prohibited from
hanging around the sets. You’ve
read the rules out on the gate, hav¬

“I have. The rules apply only to
holders of the interview pass. I’m
a holder of nothing. So—"
“So it doesn’t apply to you?” she
interrupted me.
“Okay, it does,” I backed out,
“but it certainly doesn’t apply to
you and if you'd take me along with
you, it wouldn’t apply to me, too.”

“They simply study, not that
hey want to learn and be benefit¬

hing during their long stay there.
Nurtured in Luxuries
“Our children, and I blame par¬
ents for this," continued the direc-
ress, "are given too much luxury.
Naturally, they come to believe they
always have plenty. They accus¬
tom themselves to spending, and
forget learning how to earn.

ably become family liabilities. The
boor parents have to continue pro¬
viding for all, although their chil¬
iren have already graduated and
ave their respective professions.
Blames Educational System
“Our educational system is, also,
wrong!” emphasized Directress Al¬
vero. “The instruction is purely
academic, too theoretical. It does
not provide for practical, vocational
instruction; hence a primary or a
secondary student graduates into
uselessness. That is why, despite
their education, they lack the abil-
ity to live by themselves, to suc¬
ceed in life without asking the help
of parents and influential friends."

Most of them cannot explain why
their sons and daughters have be¬
come, materially, useless.
A Pampango father only recent-
ly lost his general merchandise
store because he sent two sons
through college, hoping they would
become professionals who would
support the family afterwards. They
graduated all right, but they could

mortgaged to finance their studies,
was attached by creditors. To-day

Home Education Best
“Educate the children in the
home, first of all, and they will be
well-prepared for the future,” Mrs.
Mariano de Joya, who has eleven
children, said. “I make my chil¬
dren work in the house, although
we have servants, so they may
learn to keep their own homes in
the future.
"Proper upbringing, by a moth-
er who knows her duty to her chil¬
dren, will turn them into useful ci¬
tizens. The girls will know what
to do in the house, and the boys will
earn how to earn a livelihood for
themselves.
“I notice that religion is one
great thing lacking in the education
of the young. That should be in¬
culcated in them, the love of God,
the wish to be morally good and
the desire never to do anything
bad. We find women in correction¬
al institutions, and men in prisons.
Why? Because home education has
left out morality and religion."
Travel Very Broadening
Mrs. Salome de Manalo, among
whose offspring are a Manila co¬
loratura soprano, an attorney, and
a lady pharmacist, says that travel
is the thing she feels is lacking to
round out the education of her
children. Travel abroad is very
broadening, she says.
There will always be a prodigal,
a black sheep in most families,
Mrs. Manalo added. But that should
not mean the parents must worry
their heads about their children,
much less about the family black
sheep. The parents have brought
them into this world, cared for
them, reared, and educated them;
and, with such sacrificing attention
and care, they must, upon reaching
womanhood and manhood, learn to
look after themselves.

Dear Miss Horstman—I'm not
sure whether my face mirrors
the humor which you say I pos¬

she inquired. He shook his head si¬
lently, knowing that he was being
a trifle silly about the matter.
What did it matter to her whether
he liked her or disliked her? He
had no power over her. He could
even see that, in a way, she was
glad he'd shown his temper. It
probably proved something to her
about him—something she’d wanted
proved. She was on Beth’s side, all
right, even more so than Beth her¬
self was, probably. When she had
gone, he got up and walked over to
the window. It was warm outside,
even though it wasn’t particularly
sunny. They could just as well have
gone out as not. For a moment he
had the fleeting suspicion that may¬
be it had been the nurse who had
decided that point, and not Beth at


ing when the man came in.
“But it won’t fly,” he added.
"Look.” And climbing up on the
bed with it, he held it high over his
head and then let it drop. It fell
with a clatter to the floor. The man
watched it fall, and then looked at
the boy and smiled.
"Listen, Bill,” he said, and real¬
ized that his voice was altogether
too solemn. "Listen," he said again,
"I’ll get you one that will fly. How
will that be?”
Bill glanced up at him. “That
will be fine,” he said politely. “But
I'd 'ather have a Zeppelin. With a
moo'ing mast. Tommy’s got one,
and it has a moo'ing mast."
'All right,” said the man. He
had no idea who Tommy was. “TIl

all. Beth had played fair with him
so far, about Bill, anyway. And
these Scotch Presbyterians, with
their ideas about divorce. But you
couldn’t tell. He was in a position
where he couldn’t tell about any¬
thing. But nobody was going to
get Bill away from him.
“Bill,” he said, making his voice
very casual, "who is Mr. Bassett?”
Bill had crawled under his bed in
pursuit of the fire truck. He came
backing out again obediently, but
it was plain that the adult interrup-
tion was annoying. “Him?” he
said. “He’s a man. He comes here
sometimes.” The man didn’t dare
to question him further, and after
a moment Bill volunteered, “He
gave me that ai'plane," and pointed
to the autogiro he had been wind-

The boy had dropped his eyes to
the man’s lips. “Next week,” he re¬
peated.
“That’s right,” the man said, and
then hesitated. “Don’t tell—" he
said, and then hesitated again.
"Don’t tell anybody,” he finished.
The boy was still watching his
lips, with that transparent concen-
trated stare of a child. "I won’t,”
he said, but it was hard to tell
whether or not he had really heard.
And then whatever it was in the
man’s mouth that had fascinated
him suddenly lost its interest and
he started winding the autogiro
again. “It 'uns on the floor,
though, he said. The man turned
back to the window. It was so plea¬
sant outside, he thought; there were
so many things they could have
done together.
Soon after, Miss Thompson
opened the door a crack and put
her head inside. She didn’t speak
to the man, though. “Im afraid,
she said to Bill. “It will soon be
time for your bath, you know."
Then she closed the door again.
But the man had understood that
the warning was for him, and a few
minutes later he got up to go.
“Well, youngster,” he said, "I’ll see
you next week."
"Next week,” Bill repeated, again
watching his lips. And again the
man wondered why he did it. Was
it merely the movement of his
mouth that had caught the child’s
interest, or was there something in
the phrase itself, and the whole sit-
uation behind it, that was begin¬
ning to puzzle him? The man knew

ANSWERS:—According to law,
any person can establish a drug
store provided that he employs the
services of a duly registered
pharmacist to take charge of his
drug store. Registered pharmacy
clerks are not authorized by law
to engage in the practice of phar¬
macy or dispense medicines, spe¬
cifics, etc., in the absence of the
registered pharmacist in charge
of the drug store. In places more
than five kilometers distant from
a duly established drug store, a
pharmacy clerk or any person may
apply to the board to sell house¬
hold remedies provided he has the
necessary qualifications in ac¬
cordance with the regulations.
Said store of household remedies
cannot dispense or dispatch med¬
ical prescriptions. The board
cannot give special privileges to
pharmacy clerks to establish drug
stores under their own supervi¬
sion as it is contrary to law.

would go on wondering about it.
As he was leaving, Bill suddenly
looked up to him. “You’re my 'eal
father, aren’t you?” he demanded.
The man stared down at him for
a moment. It was just a question
like any other question, he realized,
lesigned to settle some momentary
confusion of the child’s mind.
"Yes,” he said gravely, keeping
his tone on the same dead level of
the matter-of-fact, of the purely in¬
formatory, as Bill’s had been. "I’m
your reaf father, Bill,” he said.
Then he went out.


not due to taxation, as the local
taxation is uniform in its opera¬
tion and application. It is due
rather, and principally, to such
other factors extraneous to tax¬
ation, as better business organi¬
zation of the Chinese, better credit
facilities, and superior business
discipline. The last includes eco¬
nomy, industry, perseverance, and
stick-to-itiveness.
The amount of capital invested
in a store has no bearing on the
imposition of, or exemption from,
the internal revenue privilege tax
of P2.00. Upon the establishment:
of a store, the said tax must be
paid. However, if within one year
following the establishment of the
store, a sale of P200.00 per quar¬
er is not made, the bureau of in¬
ternal revenue, upon application
of the owner of the store, may
exempt the store from the said
privilege tax. It is, therefore, im-
portant to note that the fact that
the capital of a store is less than
forty pesos is not a reason for the
exemption of that store from the
ayment of internal revenue pri¬
vilege tax—Answered by Cornelio

How To Solve The “Traffic Jam"
In A Unit-Contract Plan Technique
By CANDIDO C. ARELLANO
Tanawan, Batangas


ANY a teacher using the
unit-contract plan in tea¬
M ching has doubtless exper¬
ienced a “traffic jam," a state in
the whole procedure when more
pupils sign for conference than the
teacher can attend to.
It is axiomatic that all things be¬
ing equal, advanced pupils invari¬
ably finish their contracts sooner
than the rest. Taking advantage
of this classroom phenomenon, I
employ the following procedure
which tends to kill the monotony of
giving tests to a set of conferences,
and partially remedies the so-called
“traffic jam."
I divide the class into groups,
each of which is composed of five
pupils. The groups are numbered
according to the ability of the com-
ponents. Thus, Group I is the most
intellectual; Group II, next; and so
on.
The members of the first group


of conferees (the number corre¬
sponds to the number of groups
created) who give an excellent re¬
port during the conference on any
contract are assigned assistants to
whom other conferees on that par-
ticular contract report and sign
for conference.
Each of these assistants is given
an outline to guide him in conduct-
ing the conference, and a set of
questions that he must ask of each
classmate confering with him. To
the best assistant go the members
of the best group. Each assistant
is permitted to confer with not
more than two classmates to give
him time to work on his next con¬
tract.
Since the introduction of this de¬
vice, each of my pupils tried his
best apparently because of his de¬
sire to be chosen an assistant.
The following is a sample of the
“Record of Conference” form with
which each assistant is supplied:

VE came out of a first-class
theater and outside he saw
AL that the night was already
late. He stood at the edge of the
walk for a while, then realized it
would rain soon. Suddenly, he
started on his way home.
But the rain came immediately,
first in tiny drops. Soon it turned
into a heavy drizzle and the man’s
steps grew longer and faster. Then
the rain fell harder and he had to
stop for shelter. He found himself
at the door of a slum-house. But
the door was not sufficient shelter
and uninvited, he entered the house.
"Abah, mama, sit down,”
he
heard someone say. “You are
wet...”
He saw that it was a pretty wo¬
man who spoke. She was folding
diapers near a flickering gas lamp.
He thanked her; then, while wip-
ing the wet parts of his body with
a handkerchief, he saw her offer¬


ing him a clean rag. He told the
woman that he came from the mo¬
vies and had sought shelter in her
house when the rain fell. He no¬
ticed a chubby baby, lying in a
corner, sucking milk from a bottle.
“Your baby?”
The woman smiled and said:
“Oh, no. It’s my mother’s.”
The man nodded. In the next
room an old woman coughed. Then
the man heard the old woman
speaking.
'Lita, have you prepared the
milk for your baby?'
“Yes, Inay,” came the cold, hard
response.
There was a strained silence for
a while. Outside it was no longer
raining. The man stood up and
thanked the woman.
“The rain has stopped now. I
must go. And goodby.”
When he left there were hot
tears in the woman’s eyes.

Red loved to be petted and pam¬

leisure hours, I played with Red,
indulging his whims. He specially
loved to drink wine.
One fine morning, I saw Red
looking utterly dejected and dis¬
couraged. What could be ailing
him, I asked myself. He had never
been disappointed in his various
loves, yet... Ah, this must be the
cause of Red’s dejection. She had
refused tosaccept him, much to
Red’s disappointment. She always
fled from him.
Red was conscious of his defeat.
He looked the picture of hurt pride.
Then, his love for her overpowered
all emotions, and soon he primmed
himself angrily. He quickly made
some side-steps; and, with the eur¬

QUESTIONS:—What are the
symptoms of epilepsy? Also please
tell me if there is more than one
form of this disease and which is
the most severe of them.—An In-
quirer, Manila.
ANSWERS:—There are three
varieties of epilepsy known res¬
pectively as Grand Mal, Petit
Mal, and Jacksonian epilepsy.
Grand Mal is the most severe of
the three forms. In attacks of
this variety there occur both un¬
consciousness an d convulsions.
The unconsciousness may occur
very suddenly without warning
although in most cases there are
certain preliminary sensations
known as an “aura” or a feeling
as though a wave of cool air is
passing up over the body. In
other cases there is a sensation of
numbness and in still others gas¬
trie distress. The sensation is fol¬
lowed by a peculiar cry and im¬
mediately unconsciousness super¬

port of the government which di¬
rectly benefits them. Is this the
proper interpretation of the theory
of representation in the Philip-
pines? How about the poor far¬
mers who, besides paying the
amount of P13,747,834.45 of real
property tax, are also paying hea¬
vily for the frequent visits of the
typical Filipino typhoons?
Unjust Shifting
Suppose we shift the burden to
another class. Naturally, those ve¬
ry likely to be affected are those in
the upper social bracket and usual¬
ly this class comprises the income
tax payers. If in 1934 there were


venes. At the beginning of the at¬
tack there is pallor of the face
and hands together with complete
muscu'ar rigidity with suspen¬
sion of breathing. The color of
the face becomes more or less blue,
the tongue is often protruded and
as the teeth become clenched the
tongue is often bitten. This tense
or tonic stage is followed after a
short duration by a stage in which
there are violent general convul¬
sions, snoring or coughing and
foaming at the mouth. The foam
may be tinged with blood. Urine
and fecal matter are often passed
and in men seminal emissions may
occur. This stage lasts from three
to five minutes as a rule and the
patient then slowly relaxes, the
blueness disappears and a stage of
complete exhaustion with stupor
supervenes from which he emerges
after a longer or shorter period of
time.—From the “Physical Cul¬
ture.”
* * 


21,362 payers under this group con¬
tributing P4,203,275.53; the addi¬
tional amount of P4,854,570.00,
the amount coming from the poll
tax, may mean doubling their tax
burden or a total per capita tax of
P424.02. Financially speaking, the
abolitionists’ proposal to cancel the
P2.00 poll tax from a certain group
will mean an added burden of prac¬
tically P227.26 to another or a
shifting of a tax load, inflated 114
times more than its present
amount.
Even Bastable, who denounced
poll taxes as “unfitted for progres¬
sive and civilized nations," later
confessed that the said taxes can
be justified on the ground that
no proposition in finance has been
more dangerous in its application
than that which declares that the
aborers cannot permanently suf¬
fer from taxation.” We cannot
wholly exempt the laborers from
taxation without at the- same time
committing an injustice to another
group. The abolition of the poll
tax will, in the last analysis, turn
out to be unjust and prejudicial to
the interest and welfare of all.
The cedula tax is a challenge to
the patriotism of every Filipino. It
requires the setting aside of the
small amount of P.17 a month. For
this reason, it is our prime duty as
loyal citizens to ask for the amend-
ment of Article III, section 12 of
cur Constitution which prohibits
imprisonment for the non-payment
of the poll tax. Otherwise, a law
should be passed empowering the
tax collectors, as in the United
States and France, to attach any
belonging of a person delinquent in
the payment of the said tax and re¬
quiring employers to collect this
tax from their employees.

WONDERS OF THE PHILIPPIE


Mount Mariveles


— ROM Manila’s Luneta, Mount Mari¬
veles on the other side of the bay
A is distinctly seen and is especially
enchanting when etched against the
setting sun. It rises to a height of
4,700 feet in the center of the penin¬
sula of Bataan. Once a destructive vol¬
cano, it is now extinct and safe, its
slopes covered with thick vegetation


and virgin tropical jungle.
An ascent of this mountain should
be very interesting adventure. It takes
a day and a half to two days to make
the ascent starting from Lamao, where
the government maintains an experi¬
mental farm. The trail leads along
precipitous ridges and through tropical
forests. At higher elevations, the trees
become noticeably smaller, and orchids,
ferns, mosses, and similar plants be¬
come plentiful.


At the first peak, at a height of 2,800
feet, a marvelous panorama of sea,
mountains, and forests greets the moun¬
tain climber. This view is surpassed,
however, by sights which may be seen
only from the mountain top.
“To the east lies the bay, with Ma¬
nila and Cavite in the distance," says
a description of the wonderful view
from the highest peak of Mount Mari¬
veles. “To the south nestles Corregidor
Island with the surf beating against


its shores; beyond is the China Sea,
dotted here and there with specks of
vessels going to or coming from Hong¬
kong and other islands; to the north
and west is a semi-circle of frost¬
covered peaks, standing as sentinels
guarding the amphitheatre-like crater;
and to the northeast lie the cultivated
fields of rice and sugar cane studded
here and there with church steeples
that mark the site of towns.”

transacted daily.
With the establishment of a pub¬
lic market, local trade has dev¬
eloped considerably. People even
from the Tagalog and Ilocos prov¬
inces come to transact business
during market days. It has been
claimed that the volume of business
transacted in this town approaches
even that of Cabanatuan, the cap-
ital of Nueva Ecija. The construc¬
tion of a bridge spanning the swift
and dangerous Calao River plays a
vital role in the expansion of the
local trade.
Mention should also be made of
the numerous rice mills and the
electric lighting system recently in¬
stalled. A mining office of the
Santa Maria Development Mining
Company has also been established.
The rice trade is flourishing and
excelling even that of tobacco, Isa¬
bela’s major export product. Truck-
aa
loads of palay are


to San Jose and Cabanatuan, the
chief town and capital of Nueva
Ecija, the rice granary of the Phil-
ippines! The provincial road is
now being asphalted.
Through the untiring efforts of
the municipal president and vice


president four progressive barrios
which produce the highest quality
of tobacco in the Philippines, have
been annexed to this town. They
are Marasat Grande, Marasat Pe¬
queno, Carag, and Salinungan. Be¬
cause of these numerous sources of


revenue, it has become a third class
municipality like Echague, Isabe¬
la’s chief commercial town.
Civic Improvement
It is in schools that Santiago out¬
shines its sister towns. She has
three private schools: Mabini Me¬
morial Academy (branch), Rizal
Private School, and the Isabela Au¬
tomotive School.
Social clubs have been organized,
and this has made the town much
livelier than it was a few years
ago. Official holidays, especially
National Heroes' Day, are celeb¬
rated with more life and vigor than
before. Where before stood worn¬
out houses, now stand big and im¬
posing buildings and where before
stood tall trees, now stand shops and
stores. Credit is due to the civic-
spirited and energetic immigrants,
the town school officials, and the
late former Representative Pascual
Paguirigan for the rapid economic,
social, and political betterment of
Santiago.

and thus a world power to reckon
with. And Italy powerful and act-
ually in a position to menace Brit¬
ish preponderance in Africa, is
something England will not tole¬
rate if she can help it.
British Ready To Fight
Hence the concentration of the
British fleet in the Mediterranean
and the working full blast of Brit¬
ish diplomacy which for centuries


now has been successful in enlist-
ing the mightier portion of Europe
to fight on English side, the win¬
ning side. And Europe, right now,
is ready to go into a fratricidal war
all because England does not want
Italy in Ethiopia where Italy can
menace English African posses¬
sions.
It is significant to note that Italy
had requested British acquiescence
in the Italo-Ethiopian venture,
assuring England that Italy will
respect British interests in Africa.
Italy has even expressed to guaran¬


tee good behavior by treaty. But
England has refused to be acquies¬
cent because she does not believe in
promises of good behavior, guaran¬
teed by treaties or otherwise. She
is not taking chances.
England is no less than jealous
of the safety of her possessions in
Asia than she is of her possessions
in Africa. The fact that she is
fast turning Singapore into one of
the strongest fortified ports in the
world is ample proof that England
means to stay in the East and de¬
fend her colonies in this portion of
the globe to the utmost.
There is no doubting that Eng¬
land will lead in blocking any Jap-
anese attempt to move in the Phil-
ippines, for with Japan in the
Philippines, England faces a dan¬
ger more menacing to her Asiatic
possessions than Italy in Ethiopia
can ever hope to be with respect to
English African colonies. Italy is
not the world power that Japan is.
England cannot look with unconcern
at any Japanese move that will
jeopardize the safety of English
Asiatic possessions. Neither can
France and the Netherlands. And
there is logic in assuming that Eng-
land, France, and the Netherlands
will combine their resources to pre¬
vent Japan from upsetting, by oc¬
cupation of the Philippines, the
present balance of power in the Far
East.
Japan, of course, may yet acquire
the Philippines. But she cannot do
so any time she wishes. She will
have to wait for an extremely fa-¬
orable opportunity: a general Eu¬
ropean war, say, in which England
is involved, and thus forced to con¬
centrate her attention and energy
in the West, to get into the Philip-
pines without the risk of fighting
the combined fleets of England,
France, and the Netherlands.

“Do excuse me for a moment,” he
said and added, grinning, “I like

chance to double breathe."
“Does he act like a celebrity?”
asked Miss Stroud when he had left
us.
"No, of course not,” I said. “But
gosh, I feel uneasy, butting in like
this. He’s very busy. Let’s better
go."
"Without getting something from
him?” she laughed.
“I don’t care to get anything
right now. I feel like a blue-blood-
ed piker, acting like this."
'But your story?” she was still
laughing.
"What do you think I am—a staff
correspondent?”
“Oh, wait a minute,” she turned
around and seeing a studio clerk,
she went over to him and
whispered something. When she
came back to me, she said, "I told
him to get a picture. You'd like
to have an autographed picture of
him, wouldn’t you?” She meant Ha¬


rold Lloyd.
“Wouldn't I!” I covered my
mouth instantly. I forgot to talk in
a low voice. To be sure, we stood
out of hearing from the sound
ruck, but noise from bystanders is
absolutely prohibited, I very well
know.
The clerk sent for arrived with a
picture of Mr. Lloyd and he gave it
to Miss Stroud. When there was a
cut and the cameras stopped mo¬
mentarily, Mr. Lloyd again came
over to us. My companion kindly
requested the famous comedian to
autograph the picture for me. “Oh,
certainly, certainly,” he said. I lent
him my heavy pen. "How do you
spell your name?”
Make it to  , please,"
I said. “I’ll trouble you for another
one for myself some other time.”
He looked exhausted.
“There,” he handed over to me
the picture and the pen. "Do you
think my fans would recognize me
in that picture, or have I got any
fans in the Philippines?”
“I think they would. Yes, you’ve
lots of fans in the Islands,” I as¬
sured him. “You have received let¬
ters from them?”
“Oh, yes, yes, very many of
them, and written in English, too,
—which is very surprising, indeed.
didn't—"
“Harold, oh Harold,” the direc¬
tor was calling, "Harold, just a mo¬
ment, will you please?”
“Yes, coming,” he replied.
“Thank you very much,” I said.
"I’m going now.”
“Must you? Well, I’m sorry we
couldn’t talk any longer.
"Good-by,” I said, "I’m glad to
have met you."
“Good-by. I’m happy to meet
you. Drop in some other time,” he
said, shaking my hands. Then he
walked briskly away, grinning.
“Well,” Miss Stroud and I started
back to her office, "How did he im-
press you?”
“To-day I’ve learned a lesson," I
said, ignoring her question.
"What lesson?”
“That Im a piker,” I said, "But
if all men are like Harold Lloyd,
what would become of us pikers?”
“You’d be martyrs,” she flipped,
“or saints."
“That’s a good crack. But if all
women are like you, d’you know
what would happen?”

replaced at Malacanang by Captain
Bonner Fellers, CAC. U.S.A.
 
Former Secretary of Finance Mi¬

chairman of the government survey
board created by Commonwealth


Act No. 5. The members of the
board are Wenceslao Trinidad, for¬
mer collector of internal revenue.
and Jose Paez, former director of

school teacher in Santiago. Ilocos
Sur, was stabbed to death by his
sweetheart, Filomena Marquez, last
February 12th when he refused to
marry her. Finding her pleas fu¬
tile, she grabbed a hunting knife

breast. ., She later gave herself up
at the municipal building.
Burglars broke into the Baguio
branch of Heacock’s Wednesday
night of last week, carrying away
P200 in cash, 150 watches, and


about P300 worth of ladies’ sweat¬
ers, shorts, stockings, and slacks.
The burglars effected their en¬
trance by prying off a window
pane at the rear of the building.
The thieves are still at large.
ACCIDENIS
While buying meat at the muni¬
cipal market of Jolo last February
13th, Agustin Maligad, teller of the
Jolo branch of the Philippine Na¬
tional Bank, was wounded below the
right armpit by a bullet which was
accidentally discharged from his
own gun. When interviewed at the
Zamboanga hospital where he was
rushed, Maligad said that the .38
caliber automatic was in his right
pocket when it fell. Not knowing
that the shot had wounded him, he
picked the gun, shoved it back into
his pocket, and walked on. Later,
he felt blood oozing, then he fell
unconscious on the road.

GRAND PARADE STARTS
Continued from page 3


Children’s Fancy Dress ball, and in
the evening, Rumba in Cuba.
Monday, Feb. 24th, Fashion Re¬
vue; Tuesday, Feb. 25th, Costume
ball; Wednesday, Feb. 26th, U. P.
Night; Thursday, Feb. 27th, Grid¬
iron ball; Friday, Feb. 28th, Clubs
Comparsas ball; Saturday, Feb.
29th, Varsity ball; and Sunday,
March 1st, Miss Philippines ball.
Three more parades will be held:
the Educational and Health parade
on Thursday, Feb. 20th, at 3:30 p.
m.; Military parade on Tuesday,
Feb. 25th, at 4 p. m.; and the last,
the most gorgeous, is the Floral pa¬
rade, on Friday, Feb. 28th, to start
at 4:30 in the afternoon.
Director Luz' promise to make
the carnival “bigger and better"
each year is evidenced by the novel


side-shows, new rides, and more va¬
ried exhibits at the provincial
booths. The agricultural and in¬
dustrial exposition occupies wider
grounds than it did last year, of¬
fers more educational and inter¬
esting things to the public. The
auditorium, besides being more
spacious than those in former
years, has a more impressive
throne, wider boxes, and more ef¬
fective lighting.
Miss B. Kyle’s sensational death¬
defying dive from a high platform
into a tank of water layered with
blazing gasoline—which is a free
show—attracts hordes every night.
And the side-show people are as
usual generous with their free
shows, which they claim are only
tame samples of the ones they show
inside.

ETHIOPS TRAP 20,000 ITALIAN SOLDIERS


AKING fierce attacks along
MTembien sectors, wild Ethio¬
pian warriors surrounded 20,000
Italian soldiers and slaughtered
them by the hundreds every day, it
was revealed by Marius Brophil,
frish Red Cross representative, last
Friday. Mussolini’s men had been
trapped for three weeks now and
were unable to fight their way out.
An Ethiopian communique con¬
firmed this unofficial report, and
stated that 15,000 white Italian
soldiers had been buried after the
fierce January battles in the Tem-
bien front. Another communique
reported that 5,123 Askaris (Ital¬
ian native soldiers) were also mas¬
sacred.
Meanwhile, Italian officials in
Rome reported sharp battles along


the southern front, marked by two
Italian victories and one defeat.
General Pietro Badoglio, Fascist
Italian commander-in-chief in
Ethiopia, declared that an Ethio¬
pian detachment had been annihil¬
ated in Lama Scillindi, while an
Italian automobile truck column
inflicted heavy losses upon Ethio¬
pians in the southwest of Neghelli.
Diplomats in Addis Ababa ex¬
pressed fears that the Italians
might bombard the capital in re¬
taliation to the fierce battles along
the Tembien sector. Up to date,
Italian airmen have spared Addis
Ababa, only bombarding Dessye
city and lesser towns of the Afri¬
can empire.

EX-RESIDENT COMMISSIONER ENDS OWN LIFE HE'S A COMPOSER TOO


ON MANUEL EARNSHAW,
former Resident Comissioner
and brother of ex-Mayor Tomas
Earnshaw, calmly ended his life
with his .38 caliber pistol inside the
family mausoleum at the Cemente¬
rio del Norte 2 o’clock last Thurs¬
day afternoon. He was 73 years old.
Every detail of the suicide was
carefully planned and deliberately
carried. out. According to Mrs.
Earnshaw, the deceased without
any sign of excitement normally
took his lunch that day. He was
his usual self; but he, however,
went to a window and stayed there
for quite a while. “Then, sudden-
ly,” Mrs. Earnshaw said, “he told
me he wanted to visit the family
mausoleum at the Cementerio del
Norte.” He phoned for a car of
Mrs. Victoria B. de Andrews. When
he left the house he surreptitiously
wrapped up a lounging robe and a
silk suit in a newspaper. He left
the house accompanied by the fam¬
ily cook.
He ordered the chauffeur to
drive to the cemetery. Upon reach-
ing the mausoleum, he told the cook
to return home and fetch Mrs.
Earnshaw. “Tell her to come im¬
mediately,” he said. “The chapel
is stained.” When the chauffeur.

UPPORTING Pres. Quezon in
 his efforts to acquaint the
public with the Constitution of the
Commonwealth, the Filipinas Life

President Quezon, and a page of
the principal historical dates in
Philippine history.

and the cook had gone, the old man
closed the door of the mausoleum,
took off his coat and placed it on
a chair. He removed his hat and
put it at the foot of the miniature
altar.
He then put on his lounging robe
and lay on the floor, pressed the
muzzle of his pistol against his
head and fired.
It is said Don Manuel was in
financial difficulties, embittered,
broken in spirit, and bereft of
friends. In a letter found at the al¬
tar of the mausoleum, the de¬
ceased stated: “At this age, I can
no longer stand this misery.”

FrHE plan of President Quezon

200 principal rice producers who
met in a convention at the Plaza
Hotel last Saturday morning. The
scheme, which would fix the price

high fluctuations in rice prices
which are prejudicial to the inter¬
ests of the public.
The delegates likewise urged the
construction of irrigation systems
and flood control devices to insure
ample production of rice; the sel-
ling of the present stock of Saigon
rice at the level of the local prod-

“Those in the magazine.”
“Oh. You like those?”
“Yes."
They were silent, while she sidled
over to him and rubbed the glove¬
less little hands together over the
white-hot coffee-can cover. She was
very close to him, her hair brush-
ing against his face, and he wanted
to fold her in his arms. But he
was not brave enough. He backed
away.
The girl half-turned her head
and smiled. “Don’t move away.”
she said.
He thought her smile and friend-
liness were simulated. He could
not belicve she was like those other
girls of Chinatown. She was too
young and too frail and too inno¬
cent. He wanted to find more about
her. He was sure he had fallen in
love with her.
"I
“See here,” he said at last.
want to... that is... I. "
She was amused. “Yes?” she
said.
“Er—you must be hungry.”
Her blue eyes clouded. “Yes”
she said simply. "I don’t want to
lie to you. As a matter of fact.
well, I am. I am hungry. My fam¬
ily is hungry. Father and Mother
and little Theodore. You should see


them. They are starving.” She was
crying now. She was fumbling in
her pocket for a soiled handker¬
chief.
“You—you can have me,” she
went on, sobbing. “You can have
me if you’ll buy them some bread
and potatoes. You—
She cried.
“Oh!” he said.
He had nothing except the half-
dollar his friend. Ben, had given
him three days before. He intend-
ed to buy rire with that money.
But he remembered the suit he
bought that summer with the mon-
ey he earned in an Alaska salmon
cannery. Yes, he’d pawn that suit
and buy this girl’s family some
food. He'd pawn that to Ben and
buy that food. All the pawnshops
were closed now but Ben would
lend him the money.
He patted the girl tenderly.
“Wait here.” he said. "Drink some
coffee and wait for me."
Then he went to his bed and
pulled out from under it the suit¬
case in which was kept his woolen
suit. He wrapped the garment.
Then he stood up and moved to the
door.
“Don’t go away,” he said to the
girl sobbing by the stove. "Feel at
home. Warm yourself with coffee.
I won’t be long.”
II.
JHEN he came back the girl
Whad pulled ont the table and
placed on it two cups of steaming
coffee. He had two shopping bags
full of groceries with him and he
felt gay. “Oh. boy!” he said.
"I
thought Ben won’t lend me any
money. But he did—the old miser!
And here I am. Tomorrow I shall
order a sack of potatoes. Boy!”
She was silent. When she did
speak she averted his eyes. “Have
some coffee.” she finally said.
“Thanks.” He drank the hot,
stale coffee and his stomach
growled. He laughed. “Guess
must be hungry, too,” he said.
The girl, watching him, smiled.
“What’s your name?” she asked
him.

Extension of the Filipino re¬
patriation law to the Hawaiian Is¬
lands was proposed last week by
Rep. Richard J. Welch, of Califor¬
nia, shortly after the house immig¬
ration committee had approved his
bill to extend the period of repa¬
triation to Dec. 31, 1937. The
Welch Act provides $100,000 U.S.
government money for use in repa¬
triating Filipinos in the United
States.

War between Japan and the U. S.
is unthinkable, according to Hiro¬
shi Saito, Japanese ambassador to
Washington, last week in the face
of the bitter attacks in the Senate
on the policy of Japan in the
Orient. Sen. Lewis in his speech in
the Senate termed the withdrawal
of the U. S. from the Philippines
'a great blunder.”
China
Over 150 persons were burned
to death in a disastrous fire which
swept the slum district in the na¬
tive section of Tientsin last Friday.
The blaze rendered no less than
1,300 persons homeless.

France
President Albert Lebrun of
France, in an emergency session of


the cabinet last Thursday, ordered
the dissolution of all militant ro¬
yalist and socialist organizations,
by reason of disturbances created
by them. The royalist and socia¬
ist disturbances began when a
group of “Camelots du Roi" young
men inflicted injuries on Rep. Leon
Blum, socialist party leader. The
sccialists incensed came to Paris,
threatening to wreck the govern¬
ment of Premier Albert Sarraut.
Greece
A terrific storm that lashed Eu¬
rope last week took a heavy toll of
human lives. Twenty-one persons
died in England, 25 in Italy, 25 in
Greece, and 9 in France. In Greece
an earthquake added to the horror
of the howling gale. Five ships
were wrecked, trains and buses
were snow-buried in Greece where
the tempest was severest.
Spuin
Acts of violence were committed
in Spain last week by radical ele¬
ments of the leftist party. The
burgomasters of Queva and For¬
miche Bajo were shot at and
wounded. The Parahorra convent
was set on fire by unknown per¬
sons, but the fire was put out be¬
fore great damage was done.

PAREDES, LABRADOR
I
Continued from page i5
and B.S.C. from the Jose Rizal Col¬
lege.
Although a lawyer, he worked as
stenographer for the West Coast
Life Insurance Company in 1920.
He resigned to become private sec¬
retary of Governor Ossorio of Ca¬
vite. Passing the law clerk’s ex¬
amination, he was first detailed
with the bureau of justice and then
transferred to the city fiscal’s of-
fice where successive promotions
elevated him to first assistant city
fiscal, which position he held when
he was appointed judge-at-large last
week.
Even with last week’s appoint-
ments and promotions the reorgan¬
ization of the courts of first in¬
stance is regarded far from com¬
plete. In the said courts, there were
eight vacancies, four in Manila and
four in the provinces. With the ap-
pointment of Judges Labrador and
Paredes, six more judgeships re¬
main vacant.
Judge Emiliano Pena, judge-at¬
large who was assigned to hear
cases in Cagayan only a year ago,
has been designated by Secretary
Yulo to preside over the sala pres¬
ently occupied by Judge Mariano
Albert. Judge Albert will soon take
his oath of office as judge of the
Court of Appeals.

employees. It is her opinion that
a baby should not be subjected to
mixed feeding (breast and bottle)
or weaned before it is six months
old in order to give it a good start
in life. And no woman should go
back to her work after childbirth
until she is fully recovered.
The doctor thinks that working
outside of her home benefits not
only the wife but also her children
and her home in many ways, di¬
rectly or indirectly. The reason,
she believes, why many husbands
object to their wives’ working is
the fact that no husband likes to
feel that he cannot take care of
his family without the help of his
wife. If the wife must continue
working, she says, her salary should
be spent for the wages of persons
who take her place in the home—
the cook, and the maid who looks
after the children, for instance, for
such needs required by her work,
and the rest for a special fund.
Other expenses, such as the rent
or upkeep of the home and the edu¬
cation of the children, should be
shouldered by the husband.
These women who are working
outside of their homes agree that
employment carries with it certain
responsibilities which at times,
even when the welfare of the family
is at stake, cannot be ignored.
Home duties and work duties may
clash and it is up to the woman to
choose between them. The woman
upon whose shoulders the respon¬
sibility of supporting her family
rests sometimes has to sacrifice the


welfare of her family so as to keep
her job and her family from being
destitute.

LEISURE TIME OCCUPATIONS
Continned from page 25


vocated the revival of weaving,
even as a pastime only, as a cure
for women’s restlessness. "A loom
in every home!” should be the
motto of those who are interested
in making women stay at home,
he said.
We are not advocating weaving
as a means of livelihood, al¬
though you can make it that if
you want to. Finer clothes than
you can weave may be purchased
more cheaply, but you will have
the satisfaction of boasting that
you have woven what you are
wearing. Towels, blankets, sina¬
may or jusi cloth, abaca rugs, all
of them useful in the home, can
be woven by yourself. The agri¬
cultural extension division of the
bureau of plant industry teaches
free the weaving of such mate¬
rials as silk, cotton (into blank¬
ets and towels), and abaca (into
rugs and sacks).
At present there are five girls
from different provinces who are
under training at the bureau of
plant industry. When these girls
go home, they will teach other
women what they have learned
at the bureau. Each girl spe¬
cializes in that kind of weaving
which is most useful in her prov-
ince. The pensionadas from the
llocos provinces specialize in towel
and blanket weaving, while the
pensionadas from Samar, Leyte,
and other provinces where abaca is
produced, specialize in rug and
sack weaving.
Weaving is becoming more and
more popular as a hobby among
women in the United States. The
instructions for making a small
loom were repeated in a recent is¬
sue of the Popular Mechanics
magazine because of the request
of numerous readers.
Countrymen of ours who have
been in Europe brought home this
observation: that in many coun¬
tries in the continent, women are
seldom seen without their knit¬
ting or sewing bags, which they
take with them everywhere they
go—to the park, when visiting
with friends, in long train jour¬
neys. The first lady of the United
tates is always seen in public
with her knitting bag. She knits
whenever there is a chance. The
charm of knitting, crocheting,
tatting, cross-stitching, and hand¬
sewing is that one can lay it aside
or pick it up any time it is con¬
venient. It is ideal as a leisure
time occupation.

In Cavite, Captain R. Jalandoni
is pushing on his drive against cat¬
tle rustling and gambling. His
men last week nabbed five persons
with stolen carabaos, conducted suc¬
cessful raids in which several jue¬
teng collectors and capitalists were
arrested. Arturo Bautista, alleged
jueteng "king” of Cavite, was
errested in a jueteng joint in Imus,
Thursday afternoon last week.
President Santos of Cavite, Cavite,
reported that jueteng in his town
is practically wiped out as a result
of the vigorous campaign conducted
by his men. A total of 148 per¬
sons have been arrested in Cavite
alone, last week’s reports state.
In spite of the successes attained
in many provinces, however, four¬
teen Bulacan towns were pointed
out last week as still infested with
jueteng and other vices. In two
of these towns, Philippine Army
officers were informed that close
relatives of high officials in the
government are maintainers.


A GREAT PROVINCE.
Continued from page 10


Immigrants came from the rice¬
producing provinces of Nueva Eci¬
ja, Pangasinan, and Tarlac and set¬
tled the vast uncultivated portions
of the province. Slowly and stead¬
ily they ripped off the thick cover
of cogon grass over the virgin
earth, plowed the soil, pulverized it,
turned it into paddies, and finally
lanted their rice. Before long,
tiny growths of green came sprout¬
ing out of the surface. They grew
rapidly and uniformly and soon the
once barren ground was covered
with a mantle of green. January
and February came and the air was
filled with the aroma of ripening
grain.
As years went on, the erstwhile
expanse of uncultivated tracts was
converted into productive home¬
steads and flourishing rice fields.
Cultivation and settlement spread
wider and wider until rice was com¬
eting with tobacco for arable land.
A long harvest season ensued, com-
mencing in September when the
selling of tobacco begins and term¬
inating in February when the rice
harvest ends. Robust rice stalks
rose from the ground and became
as common to the sight as the rows
of piled tobacco drying in the sun.
Rice-laden carts rattled along the
highways Heavy trucks with their
oad of rice succeeded the train of
tobacco-stuffed cars of previous
months. Rice mills became as num¬
erous as the old tobacco bodegas.
Isabela has become a rice produc¬


ing provinco!
Self-Sufficient Now
Isabela is no longer the Isabela
of old, abundant with tobacco but
dependent upon other provinces for
its supply of food. Isabell. is now
self-sufficient, raises her own vege¬
tables, coffee, cacao, fruits, sugar¬
cane, and what is more, Isabela now
exports rice to other parts of the
country!
At the rate the rice industry in
sabela is growing, it will not be
long before Isabela will replace
Nueva Ecija as the rice granary of
the Philippines. And this is no idle
talk, either. Isabela has an area
almost equal to the combined areas
of Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan,
the two major rice-producing prov-
inces, and while practically all of
the arable land of these two are
under cultivation, less than one¬
third of that of Isabela is. The
throwing open for homestead dis¬
tribution by the government of
thirty thousand hectares of agricul¬
tural public land in the northwest-
ern part of Isabela known as the
Mallig region, is, incidentally, a
great step towards making Isabela
a greater rice producer, considering
the fact that the newly released
area is best suited to rice. While
Isabela is on the way to annexing
a new title, there is no danger of
her losing the old one For the
production of tobacco does not con¬
flict with that of rice with respect
to space or labor The former is
raised near rivers, while the latter
is grown in the plains. And the
old inhabitants stick to the cultiva¬
tion of tobacco in which they are
proficient The immigrants on
the other hand are partial to rice.

“Carlos.”
"Ell just call you Carl."
“And yours?”
“Jane—Jane Lane.”
"It’s a pretty name,” he said,
"for a pretty girl."
She blushed. "It’s a plain enough
name for a plain girl,” she said.
“You aren’t plain, he protested.
“You’re beautiful."
Jane smiled. "Liar,” she said.
When they had finished their
coffee Carlos gathered up the bun¬
dles he had brought home. “Come

The house was far back from the

the doorstep was submerged in pla¬

Jane’s feet were soaking. She
stamped on the porch to clear her
shoes of snow then opened the door
and walked in without knocking.
Carlos hesitated in the doorway.
“Come on, Carl,” she said.

which was also the kitchen, Mr.
and Mrs. Lane and little Theodore
were hugging the stove for warmth.
Little Theodore was crying and
Mrs. Lane, a short, thin woman
with straggly hair, slapped him.
“Shut up, will you!” she said.
Mr. Lane, on seeing Carlos, stood
up and put three pieces of coal in
the stove. He had, like Jane, sun¬
ken eyes.
I want you to meet the folks,
Carl,” Jane said. “These are Fa¬
ther and Mother and Theodore."
“How do you do?” Carlos said.
Mrs. Lane wiped her hand on her
dress and extended it to Carlos.
"How do you do,” she said.
Mr. Lane slapped his hands on
the legs of his pants. “Glad to
know you, sir, he said. Then he
turned to Theodore who had stopped
crying and who was looking now at
Carlos, now at the shopping bags.
“That’s it, boy,” he said to the
child. “Be sociable.
Mrs. Lane put on her apron and
took charge of the shopping bags.
"Put some more coal on the stove,
Steve,” she said to her husband.
"I’m going to cook."
Jane was taking off her coat.
Mr. Lane was looking admiringly
at his daughter’s figure. "My God,
Ma,” she said at last, slapping his
hands against his thighs and laugh¬
ing aloud. “Jane could sure get
em, eh? Come on, girl, let’s see
you entertain your boy friend."
Jane smiled and Carlos blushed
crimson.
“She’s a swell one, Carl,” Mr.
Lane said. “Pure American, that’s
what she is. Why, we are all one
hundred per cent Americans here.
I fought for my country in the
war and my father chased Agwee¬
naldo in the mountains of Luzon.
He kept on talking like that to Car¬
los while his wife and daughter bu¬
sied themselves with the cooking.
Carl listened patiently. Outside, the
winter wind howled.
IV.
 HILE they ate, Mr. Lane, as
before, did the talking. Jane
ate in silence, only occasionally
looking up from her plate while she
passed food to her little brother.
Mrs. Lane now and then said some¬
thing to substantiate her husband’s
statements.
“Now I am a respectable Amer¬
ican," Mr. Lane said, intermittent¬
ly combing his hair back with the
the back of his hand as he talked.
"I will never apply for this damned
relief. No, sir. Not while I have
my two arms and legs.
“But there is nothing to do,"
Carlos ventured. “There are no
jobs. Maybe President Roosevelt
will bring back the country to pros¬
perity.”
“You’re darn totin' he will," said
Mr. Lane. "I’m a Democrat and I
believe in Mr. Roosevelt.”
“Yes,” Carlos said. “The Demo¬
crats are all right. Maybe they’ll
give the Philippines their indepen¬
dence."
When they finished eating it was
midnight, and Carlos said he want-


ed to go home. "I don’t want to
keep you up," he said.
"You
"No, sir, Mr. Lane said.
sleep here. We’re one hundred per
cent Americans. You needn’t be
afraid.” Then he turned to Mrs.
Lane who was dragging the sleepy
Theodore to bed. “Carl’s bed ready
yet?” he asked her.
“I think so, she said. She called
to Jane who was making up the bed
in the other room. “Bed ready,
Jane?”
“Yes.” Jane came out of the room
and went to the lean-to which was
part of the woodshed.
Mr. Lane faced Carlos. “You bet¬
ter go in now,” he said. “It’s too
cold to stay up.” He didn’t tell him
he wanted to save on the light bill.
“Thanks, Carl said. "Good¬
night.” He said goodnight to Jane
who was still somewhere in the
woodshed and went into the cold
room. He was thinking what a
sweet, beautiful girl Jane was.
He undressed in the dark and
felt around for the—bed. He was
about to slip into it when Jane came
in. He hurriedly put on his clothes.
“What’s the big idea?” he asked
her.
She switched on the light. “I
have to sleep here,” she said. “There
is no other bed."
“Oh, my gosh!” he said. "I didn’t
know that. “I’ll go. I have a bed
all to myself home.”
"No, no, she said. "Don’t go.
Father will beat me up.
But why?”
“You don’t understand, Carl....
But you’re a sweet boy. You’re
swell."
"No,” he said as he finished put¬
ting on his clothes “I can’t sleep
here.” Then he stepped lightly out
of the room and went toward the
back door. “Goodnight, Jane, he
called back to her.
Goodnight, Carl. Goodnight.”

YES—THEY SPANK...
Continued from page 4


spanking.
Again, when I was told that my
boy fought with a classmate, I did
not whip him at once as many other
parents would probably have done.
I asked for explanation to deter¬
mine who provoked the fight. I did
not spank my boy that time. I al¬
ways see to it, besides, that the
punishment comes right after the
commission of the offense That
is to insure the child’s associating
the offense with pain.
Mr. Perez, however, does not use
the rod when angry. “You can
spank a child and still retain his
love and respect,” he said. “But I
am not in favor of letting the child
do his own way as do many mod-
ern parents A child certainly
needs guidance, and the rod helps
a great deal."
Pretends He Is Angry
A ranking official of the bureau
of audits pretends he is angry
when he administers the rod. And
he lets his oldest son do the spank¬


ing most of the time. He helievas
also in giving the child a warning.
If the admonition does not sink in,
the rod is employed to help do this.
“But when the child is over 15
years old, the rod should not be
used; he can be punished just as
well with a reprimand and that
sticks longer.
Asst. Director Rustia of the bu¬
reau of commerce likewise believes
in persuasion first to inculcate
obedience. If that does not work,
the good old-fashioned spanking is
used.
A Psychologist Speaks
Dr. Isidoro Panlasigui, head of
he psychology department of the
U. P., believes that some children
need spanking; others don’t. “But
by all means, he said, "never pun¬
ish a child when you are angry. And
give the necessary warning first.
If a child commits an offense, warn
him that if he did it again, he would
be punished. If he persists, then
use the rod.”
He deplored the way parents pun¬
ish their children without giving
them a chance to know just why
hey are being punished. "For ex¬
ample, he said, "a child breaks a
drinking glass. He at first says he
did not do it, but later confesses.
The parent spanks him upon hear¬
ing the confession. The child would
naturally think that he was pun¬
ished for telling the truth. Next
time he will stick to the lie to avoid
punishment.”
Spanks Children Only Once
“Although I believe in spank¬
ing," a lady professor in a local
university said, “I have spanked my
children not more than once each
in their whole lives.” This lady,
who belongs to a distinguished Ma¬
nila family, is married to a lead¬
ng educator whose family is no less
distinguished.
“I believe in reserving the rod for
really serious offenses," she ex¬
plained "But the spanking should
be so thoroughly administered as to
make up for their rareness.” This
couple has raised model children,
fine and upstanding, to prove that
the theory is more than a theory.
“Children in the average Filipino
homes,” she said, "are frequently
punished for such offenses as
breaking glasses, plates, and other
things. Accidentally breaking
hings certainly does not merit the
se of the rod. Even talking back
to parents, I do not consider so ser¬
ious as to be rebuffed with a drub¬
bing. One of my children got a
spanking because of indecent lang¬
uage. That is one of the really
serious offenses a child can com¬
mit."
There is so much unconscious
cruelty to children here, this mod-
ern parent added, as parents fall
into the habit of spanking not so
much to discipline the child as to
give vent to their anger “Chil-
dren have a sharp sense of justice,
she explained. “They do not mind
peing spanked whan thay know


THE MYSTERY IN..
Continued from paga s
other disease.
Other Cases Of Hysteria
A young girl who had fallen
unconscious from unknown causes
was recently rushed to the P.G.H.
When she recovered from the fits
of convulsions, one-half of her
body was paralyzed. Questionings
revealed that she had been mar¬
ried against her wish. Though the
marriage was unhappy and she
harbored a hatred against her
husband, she managed to live with
him. One day she saw a woman
slump on the ground from apo¬
plexy after eating something she
had bought from a store.
Returning home, this young
girl also asked for food. Shortly
after that she slumped on the
floor and showed symptoms of
apoplexy. She recovered shortly
afterward at the hospital.
Another girl who had similarly
been forced to marry suddenly
felt no liking for food. Her re¬
latives rushed her to the hospital.
For six days she tasted no food
except small quantities of milk,
yet a few days after entering the
hospital she was well and could
walk around again.
Craves Sympathy
The patient suffering from
hysteria craves for sympathy
—which only aggravates the con¬
dition. So, when Nieves Marcelo
was transferred from the Tugue¬
garao Hospital to the P G. H.,
she was confined in an isolation
room so that nobody could see her
except the doctors and nurses.
The physicians, finding that it
was futile trying to feed her
through the mouth, introduced
food into her through a rubber
tubing inserted through the nose
and down the throat.
“She probably found the method
so uncomfortable, the doctors
said, “that she decided to take in
food the usual way. Three days
later she was already willing to
open her mouth and receive food.”
The physicians who took charge
of her said that the secret of
treatment in such maladies is
making the patient realize the ab¬
surdity of the situation. "In this
case," one of them said, "we had
to re-educate her, make her real¬
ize that she could eat if she want-
ed to."
Gradually she gained weight,
and strength returned to her
imbs. A railing was placed near
her bed so she could lean on it
in her first attempts to walk. A
few weeks before her discharge
she could stand by herself. At the
time when she left the hospital
she could walk unaided scores
of steps at a stretch.


they are in the wrong. But they
grow to hate and distrust their
parents if the latter use the chine¬
las indiscriminately."

COMMENTS


IT'S UP TO THE —HE President’s Survey Board, it has been
A announced, is composed of the following
PRESIDEN'
members: Miguel Unson, chairman, and Wences¬
lao Trinidad and Jose Paez, members. The Survey Board will do inves¬
tigation work for the President who has been empowered by the National
Assembly to effect urgent reforms in the organization of the government
for a limited time.
Considering the demonstrated ability and the records of these men
who have been appointed to the Survey Board, it can be said that no
other three men in this country can promise better results in the difficult
task they have agreed to undertake. Mr. Unson was formerly secretary
of finance, is now in business. Wenceslao Trinidad was formerly collector
of internal revenue, then manager of the Philippine National Bank, is
now, also, in business. Jose Paez was formerly director of the bureau of
public works, is now manager of the Manila Railroad. All were occu¬
pants of important government posts, and what is more important, are
not of the ordinary run of government officials.
These men, then, should be able to do a thorough and more perma¬
nent reorganization of the government which has already been reorga¬
nized a number of times previously. That another reorganization is in
order is proof of the quality of the work effected before.
But in justice to these men, they can only recommend just how the
government should be reorganized. They cannot do the reorganizing
themselves. In the last analysis, just what the latest reorganization will
amount to will depend entirely upon the President. The best of recom-
mendations from the Survey Board will not mean a thing if the Presi¬
dent should not happen to agree with them.
UP TO THEM mHE convention of rice growers in Manila which
1 ended Monday this week was timely.. In the
face of a rice shortage, violent fluctuations in the price of the cereal,
and the government threat to nationalize the industry, rice growers can
do no better than to assemble as they did and thresh out the many prob¬
lems connected with the raising and marketing of rice.
The rice problem must be settled as it vitally affects the welfare
of the inhabitants. If it is not solved satisfactorily by the rice growers
themselves, there is no other alternative but for the government to step
in and do the solving itself. The latter solution to the problem rice
growers will not find comfortable in many ways.

task will be so much easier if every citizen is

his native land.
The question of defense should be settled now, and no better start
in this direction can be made at this time than to remind our young
people often that a country worth keeping is worth defending. A stir¬
ring of the youth, of the kind made by the President last week in a
speech before the students of the University of the Philippines, should
be made frequently. The young people should always be reminded of
their share of the task of keeping the country for ourselves.

The Missing Link
The President declared last
week, in denying that Manuel Ro¬
xas refused to be appointed sec¬
cretary of finance, that he, the
President, did not believe Assem¬
blyman Roxas would have refused
a proffer of an appointment from
the President if made in a formal
and definite manner.
That is just it. Why was not
the offer, if any, made in a formal
and definite manner?
