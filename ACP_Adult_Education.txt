ADULT ADUCATIOl IN ACTION


VITH OUR PUBLIC OFFICIALS..
Time and again our public oflicials have come out openly in support of our adult education movement. Some are rather ongroasad in their own work and find little time to devoto to the cause of the illiterate population. However a
great number have not only extended their full support and
unstinted cooperation to the movement, but they have exerted
every effort to promote the liquidation of illiteracy in
their provinces.
The most recent news received by the Office is the announcement in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, that Assemblyman
Jese E. Romero and Governor Julian Teves will award prizes
to the municipality in the province having the highest number
of volunteer workers in adult education and to the gunicipality having the highest percentage of literacy In December,
1935.
The roster of assemblyman, governors, board members,
and city and municipal mayors who have encouraged the adult
education movement is quite long. The Office has availed
itself of this publication in the Roll of Honor section to
give them due credit and recognition. But special mention
must be made of those governors who have shown particular
interest in the cause by sending circular letters, to all the
mayors of their respective provinces. Among these are the
following:
Governor Valeriano. M. Gatuslao, Negros Ocoidental
Govemnor Roque B. Ablan, Ilocos-Norte
Governor Eulogio Rodriguez Ur., Rizal
Governor Tomas Maddela, Nueva Vizcaya
Governor Rarael Martinez, Leyte
Governor Agustin A. Pintang, Isabela
Governor Alfonso A. Pablo, Tarlac
The fbllowing issued by Governor Alfonso A. Pablo of
Tarleo is typical of these letters:
COMMONNEALTH OF THE PHILIPPINES
PROVINCIA DE TARLAC
TARLAC
OFICINA DEL GOBERNADOR
Al puoblo de la provincia de Tarlac:
Por virtud del Articulo 5, Titulo 3, de la Constitucion de Filipinas, es debar dal gobierno proveer no solamente a la instruccion primaria publica gratuita, sino tambian a la educacion civica de los ciu


ADULT BDUCATION IN ALIAO.


dadanos adultos. En linea con dicha disposicion, la Asamblea Nacional
ha aprobado la ley No. 80 creando la Oficina de Educacion de Adultos.
Por grande que fuese el deseo del gobierno de llevar a cabo dichos fines y por grandes que fuesen los recursos de que pueda disponer, la
experiencia ha demostrado que ninguna empresa para el bienestar del
pueblo, particularmente de las masas pobres, seria realizada con exito
sin el interes y la cooperacion de la comunidad dentro de la cual dicho programa habra de operar. Por esta razon, el que suscribe, representando una de la agencias responsables del gobierno, hace una apelacion a todos aquellos elementos vivos de la provincia de Tarlac para
que presten su desinteresada cooperacion para el feliz logro de los
propositos de la ley que hace efectiva la disposicion constitucional
sobre la educacion de los adultos. Este llamamiento va particularmente dirigido a los oficiales y maestros de las escuelas publicas, a los
directores y principales de las escuelas privadas, a los gerentes de
las centrales, fabricas y otros establecimientos que emplean considerable numero de obreros, a los sacerdotes y pastores de las organizaciones religiosas, a los jefes y empleados de las oficinas provinciales y municiales, y a aquellos ciudadanos que gozan de fortuna y comodidad. Con la colaboracion de todos ellos, no hay duda de que seremos capaces de reducir considerablemente el numero de iliteratos en
nuestra provincia, y en el trascurso de un tiempo relativamente corto,
podremos formar grandes nucloos de ciudadanos mas conscientes de sus
deberes y responsabilidades, mejores conocedores de sus derechos y virilmente aptos para toda clase de traojo. Y cuando esto se cristalizo
en una hermosa realidad, tendremos una opinion publica mas inteligente
sobre cuyos cimientos podremos levantar la estructura de la verdadera
libertad y de un.gobierno estable. La educacion de los adultos esta
indudablemente inspirada pare promover mejor el bienestar y la felicidad de todas las clases dentro de una comunidad y tiende a suprimir la
ignorancia qtie es sinonima de injusticia y anarquia. La organizacion
interna de Inglaterra, Alemania, Dinamarca, Estados Unidos de America
y Argentina, donde se ejercen mejor las libertades individuales es
producto de su reducido numero de iliteratos.
El ano pasado, el ex-Gobernador Hon. Jose Urquico, cuando aun dirigia el gobierno provincial de Tarlac, ya habia patrocinado una resolucion aprobada por la Junta Provincial apropiando ciertos fondos para
las actividades de la oficina de Educacion de Adultos en la provincia.
Sus gestiones iniciales secundadas por el que suscribe han dado por resultado el que actualmente en la provincia de Tarlac tengamos a un supervisor de la Oficina Central de Educacion de Adultos que esta hoy
haciendo campana en todos los municipios para la organizacion y el establicimiento de comites municipales para la educacion de los adultos.
En este estado de cosas, el paso dado por dicha oficina central es un
reto al buen sentido practico de todos residentes de nuestra provincia.

THE TEACHER OF ADULTS AS A LEADER?


The successful teacher of adults is a leader along a
iourney which has well-defined and frequent landmarks. He
Leads along short units of graded series with a constant
mindfulness of the speed possible to his sensitive and easily discouraged student. He must take every opportunity
of pointing out whenever a piece of work is completed that
another milestone has been passed. This gives to the adult
student a frequently recurring sense of achievements. The
mistake of the inexperienced teacher in dealing with adults
is rather to suppose that slowness in comprehension is stupidity, when as a matter of fact it may merely be educational inexperience.
The job of teaching adults requires more elasticity
and ingenuity than is usual in the more formalized discipline of compulsory education.

Cognizant of the important rele and the unquestioned influence of women in the home, particularly in the Filipino
home, the Office of Adult Education has created a separate division that will take care of women's education. The objectives, of women's education are as follows:
1. To acquaint the housekeeper with the proper selection
of foods and their food values; to teach her the importance of
a balanced diet and thus raise the standard of living and promote health in the country.
2. To interest Filipino women in the art of preserving
foods and te encourage this practice so as to eliminate food
wastes and simultaneously to arouse pride in our own homeprepared delicacies.
3. To impress upon the women the importance of child care,
pre-natal and post-natal, and thereby reduce the high rate of
infant mortality in this country; to encourage them to go to
puericulture centers where competent medical and nursing services are given free and to make good use of every available
facility provided by the Government and private agencies to
insure happy childhond and safe motherhood, to teach them the
principles of child psychology to enable mothers to understand
better their children.
4. To impart to the women the prineiples of home building
and home beautification so as to increase our aesthetic sense
and arouse in every woman the love for the beautiful; to teach
the women systemati ways in the performance of their work as
finance officers of the home; to make them efficient housekeepers well versed in the art of making ugly dwellings and
poor surroundings a haven of beauty.
The women's classes in adult education are carried out in
group studies or study circles for women. The chairman on women's education who is a member of the local adult education
committee in every community, acts as the leader in these classes. She organizes the study aircles and plans out the ways
and means to carry out the program of activities of the Office
of Adult Education for-the education of women. This program
of activities is centenad in the-hoge and careful consideration
is given to the fallowing subjeets: child care, child psychology, balanced diet, feod selection and preservation, health and
sanitation in the home, beautification of home and gounds,
home management and improvement.

The textbooks used in these classes are as fellows:
CHILD ETUDY, IBALTH GUIDE, EAP. MIGHT ALD LIVE LONG, HOUBEKMPING MIG: PRESERVES THB AOUGEREEPEA, FOCDS FOR MZALTH,
SVEET HOME, and CHILD CARE.
The remarkable progress along the line of Momen's education is quite noteworthy when it is borne in mind that the
Filipino women are generally shy and timid. The recent impetus to organizo women's classes in adult education is not
sithout gratifying resulta as shown by the reports received
from the provinces. The complete report from the province of

(With Our Bocal Adult Education Committees)


The scope of the work of the Office of Adult Education
is defined by stajute. To engage ir this work of educating
the adults is to assume a most difficult task and therefore,
it should be undertaken only by those whe are prepared in
body, mind, and spirit! For this reason, organizers are enjoined te exercise great care in the selection of the merbers of local comuaittees. These meribers should net only be
the outstanding representatives and prominent citizens othe locality, but they should also be imbued with the, spirit of service and the significance of liquidating illiteracy in the country They assume the responsibility of carrying out the three objectives of every adult school, namel:':
to promote literac.', to give citizenship and vocational
training, and to encourage such activities as will enrich
adult lire.


The Office has taken infinite pains to organize committees and schools in the barries and far-flung towas of the
Philippines. The following is the continuation of the table
which appeared in our last issue, showing the geographical
distribution of our local adult education comalittees and
adult schools, their enrollment and promotion, as of lovember
30, 1938.

I have the honor to inform you that the new qualified
voters in the last elections are very happy for they were
able to exercise the right of suffrage after studying in our
adult schools. My stepmother, a student in the adult class
in the town of Bayambang, said that she has a new life now
for she has become a qualified voter.

A visit was again made to the barrio of Binon-an, Balasan because this is quite near Estancia. Here a demonstration of teaching the first lesson in reading and in writing
was given to the first class enrolled. How to sing the Philippine National Hymn in the dialect was also taught. The
pupils enjoyed the song and sang it over and over again. All
the pupils there are fishermen. They sald that they would
enjoy singing the song even if they would be in the sea.

I went early this morning to Solon to hurry up the enrollment of adult pupils, for today is Friday and I could meet
all the prominent Noros in the church at their mass from 11a00

The number of electors of Bohol this year registered an
increase of 3,488 over that of last December elections. The
government officials here attribute this great ingrease to
the intensive adult education campaign in the entire province.

number of enrollment. At present there are 34 adult schools

The graduation in Bonga was held in the evening with a
crowd of more than 2,000. In spite of the drizzle and the
disappointment over the cinema, they stayed until the last
number of the program. It was satisfying to note that the
age of the 56 adult pupils who finished Project No. 1 ranges
between 30 and 60 years! The graduates were all dressed in
"barong tagalog" and "balintawak" and every one brought a
chair to sit on in the platform. I was never more overjoyed
and impressed in my life than when I heard this group sang
the National Hymn solemnly and smoothly with the accompaniment of a brass band which they hired for the occasion. The
success of the affair was undoubtedly due to the efforts of
Mr. Pacifico Danao, a school teacher in this barrio and incidentally, the most hard-working volunteer teacher of the
adults.

In the poblacion and in the barrio of Marannao, San Mariuno, the people are planning to construct a schoolhouse for
tho adults. This building will be used to house the classes
and library of the adults. They even went to the extent of
donating a lot for the construction of this school building
for the adult classes. At present, there is no school building in the barrio of Marannao.

The local adult education comhittee No. 312 was organized
last year. In the following days the committee made a houseto-house campaign among the illiterates who were reluctant to
enroll, sayinga "We are ashamed for we are too old now to study." But the committee did not give up the work. In less
than a week 50 illiterates from 14 to 60 years old registered.
The first graduation exercises of 45 successful adults who
passed the course in Project No. 1 was held on Fovember 15,
on the, occasion of the third anniversary of the Philippine
Commonwealth.

A very welcome news received by the Office is the fact
that thousands of our adult pupils all over the country have
become qualified electors and they exercised the right of
suffrage in the last elections. The report of field workers
and organizers states that 7,302 pupils from the adult schools
voted last month.
In connection with the third anniversary of the Commonwealth, the Office distributed Poster No. 4 which shows graphically the achievements of the Office from the time it was
created by Commonwealth Act No. 80. The poster is entitled,
ONE OF THE BLESSINGS OF THE COMMONWEALTH, and contains the
following facts:

From Tarlac where Governor Pablo is most enthusiastic
and energetic in wiping out illiteracy, Mr. Rufino H. Santos
and Mr. Agustin G. Lachica, both Office organizers reported
that they have organized different units of SAMAHANG BAHAY
KUBO in the barrios. This association is, in essence, the
full significance of the native song, BAHAY KUBO, or backyard
improvement which happens to be the pet subject of Mr. antos
in all his discussions and conferences everywhere.
A great number of our moderate-allowance workers have
demonstrated that civic duty is over and above all other considerations, financial or otherwise. Reports have reached
the Office that they offered to continue their services in
spite of the fact that the Office, for lack of funds, can no
langer give them their regular compensation. It is indeed
most gratifying to realize that our adult classes will keep
on functioning as before.
A barrage of lettersreached the Office to the effect
that the adult schools in towns and barrios took part in the
Commonwealth anniversary parade last November. Some even

had floats and decorated cars with adult pupils in Barong Tuealog and Balintawak. Many adult pupils participated in the
anniversary program. Chairman Mr. Patricio Calelot of Local
No. 1986 in the Barrio of Buhi, Alburquerque, Bohol, saids
athe most colorful part, of the program-that invitad the attention oa. tha audience was the gontest.in reading and writing among adult education pupiis: Prizes were awarded to the
three best readers and writers respectively by the Municipal
Mayor, Councilors and school teachers of the town." Miss Rosarlo Cabarle of Camambugan, Daet, Camarines Norte, sent a coby of the program prepared by the Adult Education Committee
No. Mal. She wrote: "We could see their eagerness to learn and
be concidered full-pledged citizens through their smiles, as
they placod their right hands on their breasts before we started singing the National Hymn."
Miss Josefa G. Gloria, Office organizer and follow-up
worker spoke of the enthusiasm of the Parish Priest in San
Ildefonso, Bulacan, about the newly started women's classes.
According to her, the Priest offereu for the womenâs classes
the school room of the Catholic School with chairs, tables,
blackboards, and electric light gratis et amore.
It is quite interesting to learn that couples can be
enlisted in the service of the adult education movement. When
we hear of prominent persons who figure in the cause of liquidating illiteracy, we feel gratified. When we come across women leaders who spare neither time nor money to make adult education a boon to the community, we feel elated. But for husband and wife to work side by side to push through the program of adult education is indeed worthy of the highest commendation. The Office has a record of some of these couples whose
names were sent in by field workers. hiss Moncada mentioned
in her report that the adult class in the barrio of Aganan,
Pavia, Iloilo, was organized and promoted by the Mayor and
his wife. They take turns in teaching the class which started with only la pupils and now has 20.
The vital need of adult education, particularly in
the barrios and remote localities, can never be overemphasized.
kr. Bernardo Evangelista, Office organizer in Pampanga, reported that in the barrio of San Pedro, San Simon, the people
think that Dr. Jose Rizal is still living. When Mr. Nutter,
the Division Superintendent of Schools, went to San Fedro for
a visit, the colorums said that he was Risal. "Adult education is badly needed to eliminate superstition and ignorance
There is a high percentage of illiteracy in this part of the
barrio, for it is about five kilogeters from the poblacion."


mADULT EDUCALLON IN ACTION


Mr. Benito Villacorte, Office organizer in Tayabas, mentioned
the prevalent belief of the illiterate population in witches,
"kapre" "asuang" etc. According to him, he saw several
homes with coconut shell with only one eye and a mouth, placed

nightls visits of the "asuang". Mr. Maradi Dipatuan, Office
oreanizer in Sulu, brought the good news that an adult school
was started in Bilaan. This is the first adult school in the
whole province of Sulu.


Weather conditions do not dampen the spirit of workers
and adult pupils to promote the cause of adult education.
Miss Lourdes S. Ursua, Office organizer in Camarines Sur, mentioned in her last report that in spite of the bad weather
and the advanced hours of the night, she was able to enroll
123 adult pupils in the barrio of Patitinan, agnay. This is
quite a record in a barrio enrollment.


If there are so many peoole above school age who
wish to learn their A B C's, showing thereby a praiseworthy perseverance and will power, or who want to acquire knowledge so that they may earn their living honestly, how can the State, as their guardian, turn a
deaf ear to such an urgent call?

It has been estimated that illiteracy in the United
States is making the people suffer a loss of $675,COO,-
000 a year. The price of sickness caused by the lack
of knowledge on how to live amounts to a staggering sum
of money. Crime costs the United States from thirteen
to fifteen billion dollars ($13,000,000,000 to $15,000,-
000,000) a year. These are the best arguments for the
adult education movement.

THE BOOK OF THE CITIZEN, PART IV
This BOOK is primarily intended to be used as the
fourth primer in the literacy classes in the adult schools.
The aduIt student in taking up the study of this BOOK is
presumed to be in the fourth and last project of his formal
education in the adult schools, so that the lessons which
will give the finishing touches to his practical education
are afforded him, and those experiences in life which are
useful and instructive are given encouragement and proper
cultivation. The principal aim of our adult schools is to
make life happier, wiser, and more beautiful.
rm
Like the former ones, THE BOOK OF THE CITIZEN, PART IV
is divided into five chapters.
The first chapter deals with lessons on how to distinguish different kinds of letters. Besides giving practical
examples which serve as models in letter writing, the fundamental features of each type of letter are given prominent
consideration. The topics discussed in this chapter are
T
FRIENDLY LETTERS, which are divided into four classes, namely, letters of apology, congratulations, announcement or
condolence, letters written to friends or acquaintances, letters of invitation or acknowledgements, and letters requesting favors, BUSINESS LETTERS, which are of different kinds,
like letters of collection, buying, offers, advertising, and
complaints; OFFICIAL LETTERS, which may be in the nature of
an application for a position, or a petition or resolution;
procedures on how to make TELBGRAMS, and also how to reduce
an ordinary short letter into a telegram; and lastly, how to
make a written CONTRACT or AGREEMENT. Sample contracts are
shown, like a contract on selling a carabao and a contract on
buying a piece of land. This is considered an important piece
of information to be taught to our adults especially among the.
rural folks who have been oftentimes duped to signing apparently harmless but deceitful contracts.
The second chapter treats of principles on practical
ethics. The first topic in this chapter, RIGHT BEHAVIOUR OF


22.-





THE CHILD, introduces the parents into the important and
interesting subject of Child Study. The moral life of the
child is considered from different angles, and the parents
are given fundamental rules in guiding rightly the conduct
of their children. The second chapter discusses the principal DUTIES OF PAREl
TS TO THEIR UIARRIED DAUGHTERS. Generally our old customs and practices are fairly good and
prove to be more virtuous than some of the modern tendencies among our younger generation. However there are some
ancient practices which appear not only ridiculous but oftentimes disastrous. Accordingly, the parents are given proper counsel on the matter. It is likewise important to
streas the necessity of giving guidance to the young people
before they enter the sanctity of matrimony. Happiness in
merried life can be obtained by following SOHE RULES FOR A
BRIGHT FUTURE.
The third chapter emphasizes the health and sanitation
problems in our country. The topics discussed in this chapter give suggestions to the average family on how to improve actual conditions by studying the CLASSIFICATION OF
FOODS, by knowing what LAfERIALS FOR FIRST AID should be
kept at hand, and by learning the essentials of FIRST AID
CURE.
The fourth chapter gives lessons on efficient citizenship. For the first time the subject of SCCIAL JUSTICE will
be intimately discussed in the adult classes, thus giving
our folks a chance to analyze and appreciate the benefits
to be derived from this new policy of our government. Next,
the adults are taught how our noble thoughts and actions
finally contribute to the glorification of our nation and
that we are the FLAG LAKERS of the Philippines no matter
what kind of achievement we contribute to the meaning and
significance of our flag. The third topic in this onapter
enumerates the services rendered by our government to the
people, and in it are discussed also the social and economic problems of our laborers and the efforts of the Government in bringing about the BIANCIPATION OF THE FILIFINO LABORER from vices, social ills and social evils. The Government does everything for the welfare of the laborers,
but does the laborer help to solve his own problem? This
is the theme embodied in the lesson in this chapter.
The fifth chapter deals with advanced problems in
arithmetic. The edults are taught the principles of the
decimal point and percentage. The lessons presented in
this chapter serve as a review of their knowledge in fractions.


THE BOOK OF THE CITIZEN, PART IV is published by the


ADULN EDUCATION IN! ACTION


Office of Adult Education in the different dialects of the
Philippines. The following is a list of the translations
o' the said BOOK in Tagalog and Cebuano, together'with the

ADULT EDUCATICN IN ACTIUN


A number of graduation exercises took place in different towns and localities everywhere. Several adult schools
held their graduation on the beautiful occasion of the third
anniversary of the Commonwealth government. Literacy contesta were conducted and prizes, donated by prominent goveinment officials, were awarded to the winners. We pick at
random two reports about these closing exercises. They are
as follows:


Makato. Capiz. - In the afternoon of November 30, thirty-four aquit pupils received their certificates of promotion from Mayor Alejjandro Legaspi who is also the Chairman

ADULT EDLCATION IN ACTION


AN ENTHUSLASTIC RESPONSE


Submitted by Sergio R. Calizo
Member, Local No. 2188
Buruanga. Capiz


Isolated by natural barriers (mountains, sea and rivers)
from its neighboring towns, Buruanga, a panoramic and naturally beautiful town, still remains the only town not connected
with good roads in the province of Capiz. Such being the case,
it is therefore, hard for the inhabitants to send their children to school, thus leaving them in the grip of illiteracy and
ignorance.
But with the creation of the Office of Adult Education,
and its mission to educate the masses by means of establisha
ing adult education classes throughout the Islands, things ha.
greatly changed. Several months ago, Mr. Sotero Dario, Office
field worker for the provinces of Romblon, Antique and Capiz,
came to Buruanga to organize Local No. 2188 so as to take stepin the organization of adult classes in the Poblacion.Through
the unfailing efforts of Mr. Clodualdo F. Dagohoy, Internal
Revenue Clerk of the Municipal Treasurer and Acting Chairman
of the Local Committee, who is considered as one of the most
public-spirited citizens of the community, and with the help
of the Town Mayor, Mr. Emilio R. Ostan, Mrs. Esperanza T. 80
lidum, Mrs. Guadalupe C. Ascano and other committee members
adult classes were promptly organized and sessions held ev
Saturday and Sunday afternoon.
The first session was indeed very discouraging. Opupils responded to the call of literacy. But the organ
and teachers were not a bit disappainted. The toan mayo.
izing that an enthusiastis response was forthcoming, made
"bandillo" urging the illiterates to take the opportunit'effered by the local adult education classes. A week after.
mdreds swarm the elementary schoel building for enrolment

"Now", she beams With pride, "I can write to my husband
Nithout the help of others and I know th.t he too will be
kratified by the vonders that the adult education class has
given me." Her husband is at present working in the sugar
fields of Mindoro.
In a few weeka, the first bunch of graduates will receive their diplomas of proficiency and one of these will
be this sacrificing and enthusiastic mother.

DR. PALMA'S DEATH


The demise of Dr. Rafael Palma has left a void in our
intellectual structure which will be quite difficult to
fill. As Chairman of the National Council of Education,
Dr. Palma had contributed much in the crestion of the present Office of Adult Education. On August 24, 1936, he
submitted to the Secretary of Public Instruction a partial
report of the Council which recommended the enactment of a
law crenting the Office. It should be pointed out with n
pride that through Dr. Palmaâs leadership the Council decided to provide an agency through which the constitutional


late of giving citizenship training to adult citizens


vas realized.
As President of the highest institution of learning
the country, he proved himself an able administrator
a fine scholar. As a writer, author, and historian,
vigorous style and his burning love for truth are best
emplified in the works he left behind, the biography of
tal and the history of the Philippines which will be
tnted soon. As a statesman he can rank among the forest in the world for his integrity is beyond reproach. A
Filipino whose consummate love of country is a religion
is a patriot of the first magnitude.
Dr. Rafael Paima died a pocr man, for he would not sa
ice his integrity and the dignity of his -office to the
srupulous practice of getting-rich-quick. He passed
"in utter poverty, but he left a gloricus name; and
rtality has claimed him as one of these who were priged te witness four colorful epechs in our history.
in he left the indelible imprint of his deeds, his
 and his ideals.

SCHOOLS IN ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY 


Education is a tradition in the cooperative movement. The
twenty-cight pioneer textile workers who met in 1844 on Toad
Lane in Rochdale, England, scraped together twenty-eight pounds
to start the first cooperntive trading store, and formulated
the first principles of the movement, wrote and spoke about the
need for education. From that day to this it has been considered good cooperative practice to set aside some of the surplus of an enterprise for education..
A cooperative at its best is a school in democracy - in
economic democracy. It provides a method whereby people carry
on a business and at the same time educate themselves. It is
an association in which each member has one vote, irrespective
of capital holding or trado, with no voting by proxy; shares
are transferred at par through the organization; capital is
hirod for a fixad return; and the surplus of the enterprise is
distributed to the mombors, each recciving a share - the socallod patronago dividend - in proportion to his use of tho
businoss. In thoir grappling with the difficulties of their
own enterpriso and with social and economic problems in general,
the mombars of a cooperative have both need and opportunity to
talk things over, to read, to organize classes, to consult experts. Thus the organization becomes at once a school and a
business.
It is not true, of course, that all cooperatives are schools
in democracy. Autocratic managers and indifferent members may
pervert the ideas and ideals of cooper-tives. Large-scale cooperatives often find it hard to reconcile democracy with business efficiency, and in these instances business efficiency is
all too frequently emphasized while democracy goes hang. But
tho opportunity for democraticeeducation is unmistakably there.
And the Amorican public is beginning to realize that the cooporative technique is not only a mothod of doing business that
can show growth even during an economic depression, but also a
valuable agency of adult education.
Cooperative leadors for the most part interpret education.
broadly. They draw no hard and fast lines between education
and publicity, education and propaganda, education and action,
education and organization. Education is mainly regarded as
a means to certain ends, and the ends are an active membership
with a clear grosp of curront issues and problems, especially

Adult cation Vol. XI. No. 2., 1939.

in the field of economics; a public informed about the cooperative movement; and individuals receptive to the idea of
joining cooperrtives.
It is estimated that there are in the. United States today 20,000 farmers' cooperatives of different types: for buying, selling, credit, insurance, electrification. Over
2,500,00 farmers - more than a third of the total number in
the country - ars members of one or more cooperatives. The
gross membership figures, it should be noted, are much greater
than the number cited becuse many fermers belong to several
orgenizations. Rural purchasing cooperstives handlo about
12 per cont of farmers' import nt supplies. Farm marketing
cooper-tives sell about 15 per cont of the annual production.
Consumers' cooperatives, according to the latest census
of the Depertment of Labor, number 5,600 associations with677,750 members in city Ana country. These figures represont
considerable gains over previous enumerations made in 1933,
1929, and 1920. Consumers' cooperatives do about ono per
cent of the retail trade or the nation, but they haye grown
in good times and bad for ten years, the curve ef their volume of business for the list decade being very different from
that of business gonerally.
In addition to the farmers' cooperatives and consumers'
cooperatives, there are 7,000 credit unions, which-are small
cooperative banks, mainly in urban arcas, with a total mombership of about 1,500.000. Mest of these credit unions havo
been organized since 1929.
The cooporative League of the United States, which was
organized in 1915, is maintained by the consumers' cooperative
movement for the purpose ef prometing educatien. The League
publishes a large quantity of literature, inclading many pamphlets. It alsc handles printed materials issued by other
publishors. It sponsors a national school to triin officers
and employees in the techniques of medern group recreation
and publicity. The officers of the Cocperative League hava
cerefully investigated the use of small study circles in
Eurcpean countries and have been influential in introducing
them inte America.
In the fall of 1937, the League started in New Yerk City
an experimental Rochdale Cooperative Institute, which held its
sessions in the building of the New Scheol for Social Research.
The Institute was informally conductel as a fellowship of.
learning cooperetors. Class study was supplemented by systematic field service, the whole program being arranged to meet
the needs of men and women who wished to prepare for paid service in the cooperative movement.


ADLLT EIIATION INACTION


A


Of the many significant educational activities carried
on by farmera' cooperatives only a fen can be mentioned here.
Their chief agency of educatlon is the american Institute of
Cooperntion, which 's incorporated as a nonprofit educational
enterprise. Aumually for the last fourteen years, the Instituto has held a meeting on the campus of a college or university, with large numbera of officers, managers, and other employees of cooperativea in attendance. The five-day program
provided each year is an intensive one. The Institute represente no officiul point, of view; instead, it provides for the
consideration of various practices, opinions, and beliefa. The
ganeral sessions were devoted to discussions of the economic
and social philosophies of cooperation, problems of organizations, financial practices, ana the relations between governmental policy and agricultural cooperatives.
Important educational work is done also by the National
Cooperative Counuil, publisher of the Cooperative Journal, a
periodical issued in the interest of the farmers' movement.
This Council, with headquarters in Washington, D. C:, is a
Federation of 54 fann groups having 4,000 marketing and purchasing cooperatives with 1,600,000 members.
The Farmers' Educational and Cooperative Union, a natlonal farm organisation better knowa as the Farmers' Union,
has regarded itself as a "school of cooperation" and has organized many local and regional associatlons. The state organization has been supplying periodic pregram material to
local cooperetives and study groups. Reading lists, syllabi,
lesson outiines, pamphlets, and tooks are circulated.
In some of the states, notuble educational, work is being
done by ahe strong cvoperatives for buving, selling, and insurance, whiich have been established by the Farm Bureau. In
Ohlo the Farm Btreau group of cooperatives appropriates
$100,000 a year for edueution, each local association being
urged to set aside one per cent of its gress business for
Shis purpose. The education department of the Bureau maintains a large cooperative library and also conducts a pamphlet-of-the-month club. The pamphlets sent out each month
to individual subscribers are not vestricted to discussion
of cosperation, but frequently deal with other and more general aspects of economics. Extensive use has been made of
visual education and of recrestional activities to awaken
interest. A faw county organizations have full-time educational workers. It is the aim that every county shall have
at leest a part-cine director of education.
The Fann Burean of Pennsylvania, which is in process of


ADULT EDUCATICN IN ACTION.-
-
developing a thorough educational program, is using many
of the methods tried out in Chio. The Peansylvania Bureau publishes a monthly journal called Coonp Review, indicating a special emphasis on the cooperative technique.
A recent issue of the Journal states that the purpose of
cooperation is "the improvement of rural life through providing it with a better material foundation"
Some indication of the nature of education by cooperativa has been given in the account of the fermers' movement, but a better idea of the variety of educational services that they provide may perhaps be gained by rapidly reviewing the programs of several different types of cooperative groups.
Consumers' Cooperative Services in New York, the largest cooperative in the city, operates a chain of cafeterias, a bake shop, and retail stores. It sells ramphlet
literature daily at its cafeteria. It also maintains circulating libraries. Discussion groups have boen organized.
Folk games and music have been developed.
The Consumers' Cooperative Association, with haadquarters in North Kansas City, Missouri, a wbolesale cooperative handling mainly vil and gasoline for numerous local
societies in the Hiddle West conducts a speakers' bureau,
a visual enucation service, and a literature sales service.

It publishes a peridical, THE COCPAR TIVE CONSIGER, which
frequently contains eccounts of cooperative educational activities. It provides tecanical trainin courses for its
own employees and far these of the lecal societles thot it
serves. It has erganized s pamphlec-of-the-month club with
over one hundred greupa, whica hold meetin,s each month to
study and discuss the cabject presented in the curerent pamphlet. Vemen's cooperative guiles are assisted adith program.

material. A regionl cooperative educatioral conference is
held to imprave proredures.
Regional instatutes are also organized by the Eastern
Cocperative League, a federation of cooperative secieties
located mainly in the northeastern states. In 1938 three
of these instituras were held; a managers' training courses;
a general program on consumers' cooperatives open to anyone over seventeen years of age, and a course in recreational leadership. The training course and the ganeral conference met on the campus of Massachusetts Stete College; the
recreational leaders met at Silver Bay, on Lake George, Naw
York. The Eastern League has conducted radio discussien
groups and assisted local cooperatives with educational materials.
The Central States Cooperative League, with heedquar

2.


 


tors in Chicago, has rented "Circle Pines Campâ in Michiman, where it holde training courses for nine weeks each
summer bringing together leaders of cooperative educational work for conference and planning.
The Midland Cooper tive Wholesale, hiinneapolis, reporta that over seventy-five hundred adulta have been enrolled in ita discussion groups. Numerous local educational committees huve been set up. Special attention has been
given to the effective use of motion pictures for educational purposes. The Midland Cooperative sponsors a managers
school, known as the Institute for Cooperative Management.
The school meets once a year for a session that lasts four
or five weeks.
The Grange League Federation of the State of New York,
the largest cooperative in the nation, maintains "THE G.L.
The
F University," a summer school for its employees.
Farmoro! Federation, Ashevilla, korth Carolina, conducts a
school for promisin young men from the counties in which
it does business. The Cooperative Trading Company in Waukegan, Illinois, which is a unique organization in that it
has both urban consumers and dairy farmers as members, providos a program through its educitional department that emphasizes rural-urban cooperation and understanding. Copperative Recreation Service, Delaware, Chio, specializes in
helping local leaders and groups by training people, supplying materials, and encouraging "creative activities, folk
arts, crafts, music, and hobbies that give lasting satisfaction.
Study circles, summer schools, forums, discussion
groups, institutes, conferences, motion pictures, recreation,
spocial materials, special methods - all the favorite devices of adult education - are being used in increasing
measure by cooperatives. And this use is only one of the
many indications that the adult educational world and the
cocperative movement are becoming conscions of each other.
The cooperatives are organizing their educational activities
in a more systematic way that they have ever done before.
They are calling upon educators ror advice, and educators are
usually found among the institute instructors and speakers.
In 1937 the National Education Association appointed
a committee on cooperatives, which made an informing report
a year later. The committee is expected to supply a new
link betweon educators and the cooperative movement. Educational Journals are carrying articles on cooperation.
Perhaps one of the nost significant things to record is that
large numbers of adult educators are talking about cooperatives.

(SGD) ROMAN ADANZA
Acting Municipal Secretary -


 


With Our Local Adult Education Committees


Daily the Office is being swamped with an avalanche
of requests for instructiona!, materials from civic-minded
people who have become adult-education-minded. Some are
desirous to teach their illiterate relatives and companions at home, a number are bent on teaching their children
how to read and write well in the dialect, while there are
those who wish to expand and broadon their limited knowledge by reading the Office publications.
Quite recently a representativa of "SIKAP KABATAAN"
a local organization among the youth in Pasay, Rizal, came
to the Office to ask for help in pushing through their program of educating the adults. And from the Second Surigao
Cadre in Bad-as, Placer, Surigzo, came the report of nt.
Antonio Pinalva, in charge of the literacy class there,
that he had a difficult time to teach the 48 illiterate
trainees how to read and write, but after a month "thay
became very noisy and one after another they kept discussing and competing in my class room. I am proud to say
that my illiterates have learned how to read and write.
And now they are very thankful to go to their respective
homes and tell their parents what experiences they have acquired in the training cadre, particularly along their
education".
It is obvious that the Office makes every effort to
integrate all the coordinating and cooperating agencies,
be they civic or social, public or private entities, to
promote the cause of adult education in the country and
push forward the frontiers of enlightenment.

AN OPEN LETTER


Bugasan, Cotabato
May 25, 1939


The Division of Literacy
and Citizenship
Office of Adult Education
Manila
Sirs
I have the honor to request for free copies of THE
RT
BOOK OF THE CITIZEN, Part I, printed in English, Tagalog,
and Maranaw.
Being the Municipal District Mayor for Bugasan District, I want to eradicate illiteracy among my paople,
the Noros, by means of arousing their interest in reading and knowing the contents of the said book. I would
like to have the Moros struggle hard to acquire education
for it is the only means by which they can be on equal
footing with their Christian brothers in wealth, industry,
civilization, etc.
It will be highly appreciated if my request for this
publication meets your favorable consideration.


Very respectfully,


(SGD) DATU BARA LIDASAN
Mpl. Dist. Mayor
Bugasan, Cotabato


On the 19th of June, 1861, the greatest hero of the Filipino people and the greatst man the world has ever produced
was born to live and die Christ-like. For 35 years from childhood up the time he was sacrificed at the Bagumbayan field, he
had labored incessantly to make his people happy and his country 'free. Rizal loved his country so much that he had consecrated his all to the one idea - "My Country. The good of my
country, that is all I pursue". In his EL FILIBUSTERISMO he
wrote: "Freedom presupposes virtue; virtue, sacrifice; and sacrifice, love". So he put his love of country over and above life
itself. His idea of life was - "it is a useless life that is
not consecrated to a great ideal". Thus he devoted his whole
life, and his greatest thoughts to the welfare of his country.
His love for country urged him to write his NOLI and FILI wherein he pictured the political and social life of his people, the
life full of sufferings of his countrymen consumed by the most.
malignant "âcancer",
In his dedication of his first novel to his Motherland, he
wrote with sorrow and pain: "Recorded in the history of human
sufferings is a cancer so malignant in character that the least
touch irritates it and awakens in it the sharpest pains. Thus,
how many times, when in the midst of modern civilization I have
washed to call thee before me, now to accompany me in memories,
non to compare thre with other countries, hath thy dear image
presented itself showing a social cancer like to that other! I
will raise a part of the veil that covers the avil, sacrificing
to truth everything --". And thus his very life was sacrificed.
It was on a sunny morning of December 30, 1896 that Rizal was
marched forward in the field of Bagumbayan where Gomez, Burgos,
and Zamora had faced a similar fate. Rizal was shot - shot before the Spaniards as a traitor, a filibuster, but before his
countrymen as a patriot, a martyr to his country's cause. He
died for his people, for his country, singing unto eternity:
PAnd when the dark nights wrap the graveyard around
With only the dead in their vigil to see;
Break not my repose nor the mystery profound,
And perchance thou mayst hear a sad nymn resound;
"Tis I, O my country, raising a song unto thee".
As we recall Rizal's immortal life on the occasion of his
birthday, let us rededicate ourselves anew to the cause for which
he gave up his life, that he shall not have died in vain.

The growing interest and enthusiasm of the women in
the different phases of womenâs education for mothers,
housewives, and homemakers are most gratifying. Through
the initiative of Dr. Fe Horilleno, Director of the Maternity and Children's Hospital at Oroquieta Street in the
city, and under the auspices of the Office, the women's
clasa was organized last May 29 among the women clients.
This class will be unique in that, it does not only include
a mothers' study group but a women's social clinic as well,
where everyday problems that beset the housewives will be
dealt with. It is also peculiar in the sense that the
wives are most desirous to bring along their husbands in
the evening for citizenship classes and the parents' forum.
"If wives have to study to learn more the duties of motherhood, why can't we bring along our husbands so that they
will become more conversant with the duties and responsibilities of parenthood?" asked one of the students. Another interesting phase of women's education there, is the
opening of a School For Brides as conceived and planned by
the ever active and live-wire Dr. Horilleno.
More women's study groups were organized recently with
a total enrolment of 148 students distributed as follows:


- - 11
Quezon Extension, Kauban, Tayabas -

A very illuminating point brought out in the enrolment
above is the fact that not only those with scanty education
but also those with high school and university training are
very eaxer to join these women's study groups. The women's
interests vary from simple to elaborate menus in cooking,
or embroidery, sewing, crocheting; from children discipline
and family budgeting to home management and problem husbands.

There is a high percentage of illiteracy among the people in Nueva Vizcaya especially among the natives. This is
especially true among the adults whom I found out to be very
sympathetic to the movement of adult education. They are
very willing to study. They are happy that the government
began its national campaign of promoting literacy among the
adult populace of the Islands. They hope that better facilities and materials will be given to our Office so that it
will be able to carry out its noble ideal to combat the evils
of ignorance and illiteracy and to be able to give more
lasting benefits to its greater portion of inhabitants who
are in the midst of poverty, ignorance and economic instability.

of adult education from June 1939 to June 1940.
The people here are now suffering famine. There are
ROAD PROJECTS in Bukidnon but the natives complain that they
suffer from hunger because of the factthat they are not employed in the RUAD PROJECTS. Instead the people from the
Visayas are the ones employed. They asked that this practice
be corrected because they are supposed to be given the first
opportunity. I am very much surprised to, find that the people
here are eating LABOO AND BAGON, poisonous roots.

THE FUTURE OF ADULT EDUCATION


Prophecy is always hazardous; but all adventure is based
on foretelling probabilities. We analyze, if we can, the situation confronting us into the more permanent factors, and
base our forecast on these. I shall try to do that here.
We have had, for many years some form of adult education; the church, democracy, political parties, newspapers,
the radio - all are informal types of adult education. They
no longer suffice. A new and perilous situation demands more
widespread and pointed study.
New factors of change, entering history about four hundren years ago, have made the world modern. We have found
how to discover. Discoveries and inventions mean change -
change in ways of living and of thinking. Ways of government
and ways of education must fit these ways of livingChanges in the last generation have been so rapid as to
put civilization out of balance. Under these factors of change,
new problems come very fast; solutions lag behind the problems.
Civilization is threatened if we do not increase our rate
of solving problems. Dictntorahip has increased over democracy because new problems have proved too difficult for unskilled democracies.
To survive, democracy must make for itself a new adult
education. The elimination of illiteracy is very important,
but, we hope, it will soon be done away with. Teaching EngTeaching those who,
lish to foreigners is also important.
when young, were forced to dieop out of school is an abiding
need. It should decrease with laws keeping people in school
longer. Training for new trades, new vocations, is very important. It must belong to the new and permanent adult education, together with a study of wholesome ways of spending
leisure time. But none of these meet the peril that social
stability must fear from accumulating unsolved problems. As
I see it, we must have, as the principal feature of the new
adult education, the widespread continual study of current
economic and political problems.

We ore living thru a far-reaching social, economic.
and political revolution, which is so far quite peaceful.
To solve our problems democratically, the great consideration in widospread study.. Our aim must ba to make the
wholo body of citizens plastic to thought. We must build
social intalligence that constructive thinking may continue.
The ability to think new thoughts is the greatest possiblo assot in and for modern society. A stubborn inability to think new thoughts is our greatest social danger. If
a man's mind is fixed it cannot solve a new problem.
Civilization needs a new adult education, then. We
must educute for (1) new vocations, (2) new leisure, and
(3) social intelligence. Seciety, that is to say society
in its organized sense, must foot the bill for this new
permanent adult education. It will pay in money, life, and
security for what it costs.
For the third type of adult education, the main reliance must be, small study groups supplemented by public
forums. There should be no certificates, no grades, no
marks, no sphool notion tangled up with it, and its purpose
is, that the people of this country may seriously study
their probleme to make democracy work better, to really
serve the public walfare.

The content of adult education may
range from reading and writing to the deepest problems of science and philosophy. It
may be as practical as learning how to
raise chickens or as theoretical as pure
mathematics. It may demand manual skill
as does typing or it may call for intellectual, development as dogs a course in
calculus. Alphabetically it may range
from "Aâ for acriculture to "2* for zoology.
whatever adults learn is the content of adult education.

EAT RIGHT ARD LIVE LONG


It is often argued that the physical development of
the Filipino race can be better improved through proper
diet. Conscious of a desire to contribute something in the
solution of this vital problem of our nation, the Office.:
of Adult Education through its more than 2,500 adult schools
scattered all over the Philippines, has launched a vigorous
movement for the mass education of the Filipino women with
emphasis on balanced diet, proper home management and right
care of children.
This publication, EAT RIGET AND LIVE LONG, Philippine
Adult Education Series, Pamphlet No. 5, is the first material for the women's education classes in our adult schools.
Housewives find valuable lessons which serve as effective
guides in the execution of their household duties.
They
are led into the study of the fundamental principles governing the qualities of foods and the secrets of their preparation.


Adult womon are taught that rice, corn, camote, gabi,
camoteng-cahoy, fruits and vegetables generally, are kinds
of food that give us strength. Meat, fish, eggs, and milk
repatr the worn out parts of the body. Fruits and vegctables in the form of ash are used for building and repairing
the teeth, bones, blood, hair, and nails. A person who does
not eat enough vegetables and fruits oftentimes feel sleepy,
dull and lazy. Our country has a very rich variety of fruits
and there is no reason why a Filipino should prefer to cat
imported canned fruits rather than raise them in his orchard
and have fresh fruits anytime he desires.
In this pamphlet attention is called to the fact that it
is more healthful to serve fruits to occasional callers than
cakes and gandies because fruits do not dull the appetite for
the next meal. A good knowledge about vegetables is also desired of every household manager Our country is a land of
plenty and good vegetables. Vegetables should be saten at
least twice a day especially the green leafy ones. Many of

them can be esten naw, like lettuce, mustard, amargoso, cabbage, raw pepper: carrots, sincamas, papaya, etc. The common
mathod of aqueezing the bitter juice of amargoso is wrong,
bocaugo the very substance necessary in amargoso is thrown
away, consequently what is left is mostly cellulose which
is similar, to the "sapal" of the coconut after the milk is
equeesed. The cookod leaves of vegetables have unpleasant
odor if they are cooked longer than what is necessary. To
get pood result, cook the leaves shortly before the meal is
announced, so that by the time the family is on the table
the dish is piping hot.
Tho following principles are also given emphasis in
our adult classes for women1. It is more economical to buy more fruits and vegetables in season than out of season.
3. Leafy vegetables have more food value than fruit.
vegetables.
3. Camote leaves, cancong and other similar leaves
have almost the same value as the expensive cabbage.
4. Vegetables which can be caten raw have more food
value than vegetables which are cooked.
5. The vellow varieties have more food value than the
whito varietlos.
6. Meat and fish have almost the same food value, so
when one is served the other should be omitted.
7. The cheaper cuts of meat have the same food valuo
as the more expensive parts. Each, however, has its appropriato way of cooking.

10. Camote has the same food value as potato. Brown
sugar has mare food value than white or refined sugar.
Judging from the numerous requests for this pamphlet
from all parts of the country, we are convinced that the suggestions offered therein will prove helpful to the average
housewife whose endless duties in the home really need, not
only labor-saving devices but also a wider vision to effect
more time, effort and money which will result in better home

THE DIRECTOR WENT SOUTH


For the purpose of inspecting adult schools and making a general
survey to detormino where adult education can best be promoted in Mindanao, the Director made a trip to the South last month, from May 7
to May 17. He was accompanied by Dr. Nicolas Quilon, Chief of the Administrative Division. The itinerary included the City of Cebu, City
of Zamboanga, City of Davao, and the provinces of Cotabato and Lanao.
The survey revealed the deplorable conditions of the Moros in Cotabato and Lanao, particularly in the latter where the rules of hygiene
and sanitation are entirely unknown to the Moharmedan Filipinos. Tho
Moro houses need more ventilation and more windows. The plan of the
Offico to modernize the social lifo of the Moros appears to be a real
need to effect the necessary changes in their ways of living.
The Director met several public officials in this inspoction trip,
among them may be mentioned Governor Sobrecarey of Davao, Mayor Artiaga
of the City of Davao, Commissioner Guingona of Mindanao and Sulu, and
Governor Rayal of Lanao. They all pledged their support and cooperation
to promote adult education in their respective jurisdiction.
A very interesting case was the petition of a delegation of Moharmodan Filipinos in Lanao for more moderate allowance workors in this
province. The Director assured them that if the present experiment of
adult education wor' es in Lanao succoeds, their petition would be
2
considered.

The municipal mayors have been very active in the promotion of adult education in their respective localities.
The Nunicipality of Katipunan in the province of Zamboanga
undor the leaderkhip of Mayor Nicolas M. Limbaga Umanimously paaged Resolution lo. 93 wherein the town expressed
soceptance ard willingness to establish adult education in
the community. The success of the adult education movement
in many places is due to the untiring efforts and material
as wali as moral support given by municipal mayors. Ve have
Mayor Vicente Tison of Arenguren, Tarlac who donated an alconol lamp for the use of the adult class, and also pencils
and papor fer the adult pupils. Then we have Mayor Alfredo
Caldino of Nalilipot and Mayor Eulogio Lawenko of Bacacay
in Albay who are very generous in supplying the kerosene
for the light of the adult classes in their towns.
In the barrios of Muladbucad, San Isidro, Nagar, and
Bayandong in Legaspi, Albay, the adult schools are in full
swing, with lively classes and big attendance, according to
the Tield worker, Hiss Lourdes S. Ursua. The adults are so
eager to attend the classes that they come much earlier
than the scheduled hours for classes. The volunteer teachors in Nagar and Bayandong, M'. Juan Aspra and kr. NicolasHinamor respectively, come to the school an hour earlier
so as to supervise the pupils in their studies. They are
rormed into study groups so that every pupil will have an
opportunity to study the lesson before the classes start.
During this study period they exchange books and preparethe assignment for every lesson.
Moncada leads the other towns in Tarlae in the number
of adult schools, twenty-four in all, that promote the liquidation of illiteracy. It demonstrates that it means
business, for a policeman is sent around to gather recalcitrant illiterates from their homes and being them to the
adult schools. The moving spirit in this enthusiastic promotion of adult education in Moncada, Tarlac, are Mayor
Antonio Lopez and Vice-Mayor Maximo Gallardo.
Reports of adult education activities in other parts
of the country are indeed encouraging and quite satisfactory. It is believed that with the concerted efforts of
the illiterates, the citizens, and the public officials,
our goal of eradicating illiteracy in a few years will soon
come to realization.

to the importance of rice production, thus making this country self-sufficient at least in our staple food. Rice Planting Day should also aim to dignify labor in the fields, stimulate interest in agriculture and help to a better understanding of our agrarian problems.
For this reason, we wish to solicit the earnest cooperation of the members of our local adult-education committees
for the purpose of making the Day a success in every community.


On the day designated as Rice Planting Day, all houses
in the community should display flags, buntings and other
decorative materials. Early in the morning, the people should
gather in their respective places of worship to implore the
Almighty for His guidance and for abundant harvest. In the
afternoon, a short parade consisting of floats constructed
on carts and sleds and people in costume may be held. At
the end of this parade, a short musical literary program
may be given as followss


1. Opening remarks - By the Teniente-Consejal
2. Significance of the Day - By a prominent resident
of the community
3. Native songs (such as planting rice, etc.) - By
a member of the community
4. Our Rice Problems - By a representative, Bureau
of Commerce
5. Native dances - By members of the community
6. Methods of Improving the Variety and the Yield
of Rice - By a representative of
the Bureau of Plant Industry
7. Native poems - By a member of the community
8. Qecupations from the By-products of Rice - By a
representative of the Bureau of Commerce or of the Plant Industry


It is hoped that the members of our local adult-education cormittees, joining hands and heads with the civicspirited citizens of the community, will be able to celebrate
Rice Planting Day fittingly but with the least expunse.

MEMORANDUL: CIRCULAR


SUBJECT: Celebration of Rice Planting Day


TO ALL WORKERS IN ADULT EDUCATION:
His Excellency the President of the Philippines, issued
proclamation No. 402, wherein he ordered municipal councils
to set aside one day during the rice planting season in each
community for the celebration of Rice Planting Day. As soon
as that day is fixed by the municipal council, members of the
local committee who are charged with the promotion of education among the masses, should fittingly observe the day in
their respective communities by holding an appropriate program for the purpose of directing the attention of our people
to the importance of rice production and to the need of making this country self-sufficient in this particular agricultural produce of prime necessity.
Rice planting in the Philippines may be considered an
institution by itself. Many beautiful customs and traditions
are observed in connection with it. Songs, folklores, lullabies, and stories have been sung and written to portray the
beauty, the spirit and the joy during the planting season.
In tune with native guitars, men, women and children, while
bending over stalks of palay, fill the air with harmonious
melodies. While the sun sprays over the field rays of hope
for a plentiful harvest, the rice planters skillfully, patiently, and industriously perform their work, and at noon they
squat around banana leaves spread over the ground and eat and
drink to their nearts; content.
Rice planting plays a distinctive role in the lives of
our rural population. It gives them an opportunity to demonstrate their good will and their spirit of cooperation so characteristic of our people. Ve should exert efforts to celebrate Rice Planting Lay not only in commemoration of these
national traits but also to direct the attention of our people
