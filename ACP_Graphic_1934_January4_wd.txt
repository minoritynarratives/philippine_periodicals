o You Believe In

By DON MARQUIS


DERSONALLY, I have been an In-and-Outer about
 this future-life business; I have thought about if
for years. And I have had long periods when I did not
believe in if; now,I am in a period when do. And
hope if lasts.I feel beffer when I am that way. In
fact, I have noficed that whenI am in a phase when
don’t believe in it and am discussing if with someone
who agrees with me, ! don’t like that person so well;
Iarm up to the fellow who tries to convince me that
there is a future life. I suppose it must strike me tha
he is a generous sorf of guy who is trying to hand me
something nice and l ought to feel grateful to him.
Well, anyhow,I am in one of my periods when
believe in it, and it has lasted for several years, and
the question is: How did I get that way?
gof that way by wishing for it. If you keep up
with the modern slang, you musf have heard the term
'wish-fulfillment."
The term "wish-fulfillment" is acceprable to me nof
only in my own personal case, but as a definition of
the manner in which all the millions of men fhrough all
the ages have atfained their faith in a fufure life. They
wished for one. There was something in them that
made them wish for one. One may wish to grasp a
fruth, and grasp it, as well as wish to become the flat-
tered victim of a pleasant illusion. And one line of
continuing inquiry is: What is it in man, and in the
rest of the universe, which makes man wish for
this?
Ibelieve that, beyond the physical, man has a
mind, or spirit, or soul, or call if what you like. Anc
it is this affribute which makes him wish to grasp the
truth of a future life. If seems to me impossible fo
speculate upon the precise manner in which if came
into existence. Myself,I prefer to grab one apparent
fact, and hold tight to it: The spiritual element in huma¬
nity does exist, for here if is; and runs the human show.
Whether it disturbs us fo acknowledge it or not,
we shall have to recognize that it is the spiritual ele¬
menf in man—the element which thinks and acts, in¬
dependently of the salts and gases which constiture
his physical body—which is the seat and center of his
 Tion ug Angrenn Marne


life. Wherever it came from, if has command of the
body. If decides his desfiny and justifies his existence.
It is the motions of this part of him, and this part of
him alone, which triumph over fime, outlive fhe passage
of long years, and stamp the ouflines of his personality
upon the pages of the fufure.
believe the mind of man will continue to exist
es an enfity, as an individual, affer the death of the
physical body. And since the essential man has pro¬
gressed through so many changes, I do nof see why
the final abandonment of his physical body might nof
be merely the prelude to many continuing changes.
My ground for the belief is neither more nor less
than the proposition that whatever makes the universe
go” is imperishable.
There is something which makes it "go.” This cen¬
fral motive power you may call spirit, or God, or you
may reject those terms and invent new ones; but you
do not doubf the continuing exisfence of the thing if¬
self. If simply is, and it cannot stop being; for the one
thing unimaginable is a state of complete Nothingness.

THE END OF THE COMEDY


p HINGS are coming to a head out in Washington, D. C. After
1 being put off for weeks, an audience has at last been granted
the Quezon mission by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. And the
outcome has made things anent this question of Philippine indepen¬
dence hum more than ever.
Details about that momentous conference have not been de¬
finitely released at this writing. And the mere rumors are con¬
tradictory, even those reported by non-partisan agencies of news.
One press dispatch, for instance, has it that the U. S. chief executive
was understood to have said that he considered the HHC act as a
good solution of the Philippine problem; while another dispatch
—through a different service—stated the contrary.
This much, however, is known for sure: that President Roose¬
velt asked Senate President Quezon to formulate in writing that
better-than-the-HHC-act independence bill the antis have been
talking so glibly and vociferously about.
Here is a situation which calls for comment along more than
one line. In the first place, it becomes apparent that the Quezon
mission set out for the American capitol without any well¬
planned, concrete proposal for the solution—a la unti—of the
Philippine question. Which, no impartial observer will deny,
makes for the proverbial pretty kettle of fish.
The bare facts are a commentary in themselves. Here we
have the majority party in the legislature of a subject nation
turning down an offer of independence from the mother country
in the cocksureness of being able to wrest terms preposterous
under prevailing conditions. If the rejected measure is to be re¬
wvived at all, it must within a short time (to be exact, not later
than January 17th, 1934). The said party, after wasting a lot
of time before deciding what to do with the bill it ultimately dis¬
carded, sends over a delegation to haggle for what it calls vaguely
something better.” Arrived at the capitol of the sovereign na¬
sion, some three weeks are consumed before a conference with
he chief executive is arranged. During that time, the members
 the delegation evidently have considerable leisure for social
affairs agrd e



the president takes place, the representatives of the suppliant
nation have no well-defined counter-offer to make! They have to
ask for about a week’s grace curing which to say what they do
want, and wire frantically to their colleagues back home for sug¬
gestions.
It has been argued that the interview with the president
was supposed, obviously, to be more of a, social luncheon than an
official occasion to discuss business. The head of a nation be¬
leaguered by internal vital problems, every bit of whose time is
precious, and one whom it takes three weeks to “date up” so
to speak—and yet, it is assumed that the conference with him it
took so long to arrange must be little more than an excuse to
chat aimlessly while eating!
In any case, however, this cannot be blinked away: that the
Quezon mission set out without, as it were, knowing precisely
what for. Otherwise, how explain why it had to ask help from
the legislature of which it is the official representative? Imagine
a person duly conferred power of attorney later bewilderedly re¬
questing instructions from his principal on how to act on the
very question he had been authorized to handle to the best of
his ability!
But quite apart from the showing of the Quezon mission,
which smacks of both inefficiancy and effrontery, it is to be
feared that further blunders will be committed. The antis have
been asked to say just what they want. Like as not, they will
demand something ruinous to the country, such as the Gabaldon
project, which calls for independence after a transition period of
only two years—which would mean economic disaster for us; or
else lay down terms so unreasonable, conceding little to the mo¬
ther country, that she will be forced to refuse said terms, result-
ing in the indefinite postponement of our freedom. Which, many
have long suspected, is possibly the objective anyhow of those
who have killed the IIHIC act. In all of which there is only this
shred of consolation: witk the Quezonistas finally forceday
mit themselves, th

The Antis” Have Ther


Aiter Weeks Of Gloom As U. S.
President Receives Quezon Mission,
Asks For Concrete Proposal To
Solve Philippine Problem


Futile So Far
E—HE Quezon expeditionary
force has been in Washington
t almost a month now. At this
writing, Quezon with his little band
has failed to garner any trophy
sizeable enough to cheer the antis
in the Philippines who have been
suffering increasingly from the
jitters since the pros took the field
anew for the very purpose of tell¬
ing the electorate what a fine time
Mr. Quezon has been having in
Washington. As far as the scoring
goes, therefore, Mr. Quezon has
chalked up exactly nothing, and
since the score of the pros is the


U. S. Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt: ex¬
tended the opportunity to Quezon und
his mission to write down their own pro
gram for the solutian of the Philippine
problem.
exact inverse of that of the antis,
it is easy to understand why the
pros are yelling their heads off.
Take, for instance, the following
press dispatch from Washington:
"Despite the presence of Senatc
President Mannel Quezon's new
mission and the announcement of
Senator William King of Utah
that he will reintroduce his im¬
mediate independence bill, it is
not believed the issue will assume
great proportions.
“Even Senator King is not op¬
timistic... He said it was clear
that conmanding domestic issues
would consume much time and
miglit force aside the Philippine
problem."
The antis, publicly of course, dis¬
count the importance of this omin¬
ous sign and similar bad oracles but
unless they are in possession of
positive evidences that the Quezon
army will rally in Washington and
finally obtain what it is after, the
cloud which has continued to damp-
en the hopes of the Quezon mission
cannot but make the antis feel they
are sick in the stomach.
Osias Opens Fire


the arrival in that capital of ban¬
tam fire-eater Osias who, in his of¬
ficial capacity as resident commis¬
sioner and, therefore, member of
congress, is likely to get more atten¬
tion in Washington political circles
than Marshal Quezon himself.
Osias made himself famous (no¬
torious, some say) for his rugged
language and fiery sallies against
the antis here, and in Washington,
against the same antis, Bantam
Osias is no less rugged, fierce. Im¬
mediately upon arrival in Washing¬
ton, Osias shelled Quezon; called
him and his mission "assassins of
independence":
“I do not feel that this is a
propitious time for bringing up
the independence issue again. It
was a colossal blunder not to
have accepted the HHC bill and
then worked for a better measure
later. Acceptance would not have
jeopardized our chances of ob¬
taining a modified bill.
“Quezon and his satellites as¬
sured the death of the bill by re¬
fusing it in the legislature. Now
he knows that the door is not
wide open for his new plea and
that the sentiment among the
leaders here opposes reopening


the issue.
“I hope he (Quezon) will act
quickly and call the Philippine
legislature into session beforo
Jan. 7 to accept the bill as re¬
quired.
Fiery Osias might have derived
a lot of personal satisfaction from


coming from the pro P. I. headquar¬
ters. While it is not surprising to
see the antis wailing deep injury
at Osias' Washington shelling, it
should interest Osias to know that
his one-man attack on Quezon in
Washington was received locally
with emphatic lack of warmth.
Commented pro Tribune edito¬
rially:
“It is necessary to say of Mr.
Camilo Osias... that campaign
oratory and literature very prop¬
er in the Philippines in connec¬
tion with the controversy over
the rejection of the Hare-Hawes¬
Cutting Law or with the in-
jection of that controversy in the
electioneering campaign now go¬
ing on, are out of place in Wash¬
ington just now as the means to
use against the Quezon Mis¬
sion...
“Mr. Osias, having blundered
in his first public appearance in
Washington, is now a liability to
the new minority. If he persists
in his belief that the best way to
serve the cause he is defending
is to continue speaking out of
turn, he will be an obstinate
liability, and his own acts will be
the confirmation of the criticism


of him that he likes to talk be¬
cause he finds pathological de¬
light in hearing himself talk
S
about Camilo Osias.
Pro La Vanguardia is also disap¬
pointed at Osias’ attack on Quezon:
“.. .on the eve of Commis¬
sioner Osias’ departure we said in
an editorial these words:


that the sons of the same country
may come to an understanding,
and that instead of the stormi of
political passions which envelop
us here, the inspiring vision of
a common country would give our
men of judgment the highest
concept of their responsibilities."
"This was the hope that we
had, which turned out ill-founded
the moment Commissioner Osias
hurled his bomb against the
eleventh mission in Washing¬
ton..."
No doubt Commissioner Osias
will get a lot of notice for the fire¬


Sen. Osmena: recently he marched
o Cebu, hunting down antis and
anti strongholds.
works he exhibited upon his arrival
in Washington: Washington is
talking about Osias, and what is
more important, also the Philip-
pines, although in the latter place
Commissioner Osias would not care
to hear what is being said about his
Washington exploits. It is remem-
bered that Commissioner Guevara
who, like the Red Hot Osias is a
pro, came out for co-operation with
the Quezon mission and was round-
ly praised therefor.
Quezon Sees President
T last! Quezon and his mis¬
sion have not only succeeded
Ain secing President Roose¬
velt but have also the satisfaction
of having lunched with him on De¬
cember 27. It looks like the Quezon
mission’s luck is turning for the
better, although at this writing
there is exactly nothing to be all
excited about. Here is one version
of the meeting between the Quezon
expeditionary force and the U. S.
president:
“Manuel L. Quezon, head of
the Philippine mission, and mem¬
bers of his delegation were
guests at a luncheon at the White
House to-day (Dec. 27). It was
repgrted that Mr. Quezan inform-


Quezon ascending the gangplank to the S. S. Hoover which carried the Quezon mis¬
f obtaining something “better than the
tezon had high hopes
sion to the U.
HHC act” then. Will these hopes be realized?

Osias Keeps On Firing
N the same day that the Que¬
zon missioners were received
in the White House (Osias
was not present), Bantam Osias,
took up the firing he started
upon arrival in Washington, ampli¬
fied his opinion of Quezon and his
ilk, divulged his views on the inde¬
pendence situation, ventilated pro¬
anti squabble in the P. I.:
“The Filipino people continue
their passionate desire for the
early grant of independence pro¬


mised by the United States. On
that fundamental issue there is
substantial unity in the Islands.
"On the independence act
passed by the Seventy-second
Congress there is a division in
our country. The group headed
by Quezon favored rejection and
then to work for amendments or
brand new legislation. The other
group headed by Senator Sergio
Osmena and Rep. Manuel Roxas
advocated acceptance of the law
without sacrificing the people’s
rights, and afterwards to petition
for modifications. I belong to the
latter group.
"Personally I believe the ma¬


jority of the people would have
accepted the Hawes act if given
the opportunity to vote in a na¬
tional plebiscite.
"I am not with the Quezon
mission but I am a Filipino first
and a partisan only incidentally.
I shall present the truth and the
facts to America and the Philip-
pines regardless of who is affected
but shall not adont a policy of
obstructionism. Tf the mission
achieves success I shall be among
the first to accord its members
honor and credit.
Of course I believe the Que¬
zon group committed a fatal

ed President Roosevelt that the
insular legislature did not accept
the Hawes-Cutting law and asked
for new legislation which should
safeguard the best interests of
the United States and the Philip-
pines while at the same time as¬

sent at the luncheon and con¬
ference, besides Mr. Quczon, were

and forier Commissioner Isauro

No official communique was is¬
sued either by the White House or
the Quezon expeditionary force on
the exact nature and results of the
conference and luncheon, but Mr.
Quezon before the meeting gave
some idea of the day’s business to
newsmen. He told them that he
would:
". . .inform the President on the
action of the Philippine legisla¬
ture in deciding not to accept
the Hawes-Cutting law, and...
request the enactment of a
measure which would insure the
independence of the Philippines
and at the same time safeguard
the interests of the country.”

Ruperta de Ramos, the ten-year-old
Candelara girl who won a
nol P75,000
in the P. A. A. F. sueepstakes.
EE HE year just passed was
crowded with events that a
I commentator cannot over¬
look, but it will perhaps be re¬
membered by most people as the
year in which the first sweepstake
race was held in this country. No
other occurrence in recent years
has succeeded in keeping the en¬
tire country on its toes, so to
speak, than this last bid for fame
of the year 1933.
Four days after this mammoth
show, put up by no less a showman
than Arsenio Luz and his associate,
Isaac Barza, for the benefit of Phil-
ippine athletics, the first local
sweepstake race is still the talk of
the country. It clings to the pub¬
lic imagination such as no recent
happening has.
The popular interest in the first
local sweepstake race can be seen
in the following facts: approximate¬
ly a million people, the holders of
the 385,000 tickets to the race and
their families, listened for hours


last Sunday to the voice of the in-
visible radio announcer telling them
of the slow drawing of the lucky
numbers or waited on the streets
for copies of the extra editions put
out by Manila newspapers; about
sixty thousand people packed the
San Lazaro hippodrome to witness
the spectacle. An obscure ten-year¬
old child in Candelaria, Tayabas, Ru¬
perta de Ramos, who won the pre-
mio gordo of P75,000, and an unas¬
suming Siamese student in the col¬
lege of engineering of the Univer¬
sity of the Philippines, Baipulya
(not Barpalya as erroneously re¬
ported in the dailies) Naganidhi,
who won the third big prize of P25.


000, were catapulted into fame over¬
night. There was hardly a gather-
ing in Manila days after the race
where the name Ruperta de Ramos
was not mentioned. As for Baipul¬
ya Naganidhi, his winning the third
big prize again demonstrated Dame
Luck’s unexpected way of smiling
in the direction of the unsuspecting.
At 5:40 o’clock in the afternoon
of December 31, 1933, the KZRM
announcer broadcast to his large if
invisible audience the winning num-
bers in the race, and a few minutes
later the extra editions of the Tri-
bune, the Taliba, and the Herald car¬
ried the complete results of the day’s
spectacular "show.” At exactly this


time, when the whole country was
being told through the air and the
papers that he had suddenly become
richer by P25,000, Baipulya Naga¬
nidhi, member of a well-to-do fami¬
ly in Dhonburie, Siam, was enjoying
a movie in a down-town theatre.
Hours later, while newspaper men
and press photographers combed the
city for him, he returned to his
boarding house on Oregon Street
and was subsequently informed by
his roommates that the only sweep-
stake ticket he (Baipulya) had
bought had netted him a cool
P25,000!
Much had been written and said
regarding what some people would
do if they win one of the big sweep-
stake prizes days before last Sun¬
day. Now that the race is over it
would seem that the lucky winners
can say with certainty what to do
with their prizes. Baipulya Naga¬
nidhi, however, seems to be the last
affected by the prize that a million
pcople had coveted. This silent,
nineteen-year-old Siamese student
has no plans with regard to the dis¬
posal of the big amount that has
suddenly come his way, although it
is most likely that he will send it to
his father in Dhonburie.
The second prize of P37,500 was
won by a number of La Yebana of¬
ficials and employees who formed a
pool. The largest shares went to the
company officials, including Enri¬
que Carreon, the Marquis de Melin,
and Anthony Macleod, manager of
the cigar and cigarette factory.
Here is what Mr. Macleod said con¬
cerning this piece of luck: "I am
very happy over our luck. It cer¬

PRESENTING THE GRAND PRIZE WINNER
By MENA R. QUINTO
(Tayabas Correspondent of  )
UPERTA DE RAMOS, the lucky ten-year-old girl who won the grand
Kprize of P75,000, when seen by the writer in her father’s house
in Barrio Malabanban, Candelaria, Tayabas, gave him to understand that
she has ambitions of becoming a nurse. "My coming visit to Manila
with my father to get the prize will be my third," she remarked in¬
cidentaliy.
Juan de Ramos, father of Ruperta, who is a farmer and owns a
large coconut plantation in Barrio Malabanban, bought five tickets to
the sweepstake race from an agent, Cecilio L. Magadia, and placed
them under his name and those of his wife, two married daughters, and
Ruperta. Incidentally, it might be mentioned that Ruperta’s father
learned of the P. A. A. F, sweepstake from his reading Liwayway.
“I am going to deposit P50,000 of the prize in the Philippine Na¬
conat Rank and invesf the rest in the improvement of my farm.” he
declared. "I may run, in the future, a poultry business. Being an
ex-official of Malahanban, ! am more than willing to contribute to the
barrio fund for the improvement of the school building.
“I am planning to leave Candelaria with my family during the Car¬
nival week to visit the P. A. A. F. headquarters and get the prize. After
this we will all visit the Carnival city and let Ruperta enjoy herseli.
I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the P. A. A. F. manage¬
ment for the splendid way in which it conducted the race. I wish also
to thank the agent, Mr. Cecilio L. Magadia, who sold me the tickets and
who informed the P. A. A. F. management that the owner of the prize¬
winning ticket is in Candelaria.”

Mayor Tomas Earnshaw of Ma¬
nila seenis to be favored by a streak
of luck for he is not only lucky in
running the affairs of the city but
in “playing the horses.” He is one
of the two hundred and fifty per¬
sons who became the recipient of
P200 each for possessing the first
winning two hundred fifty tickets.
Other fortunate individuals were
Assistant Director Angel S. Argue¬
lles of the bureau of science, win¬
ner of a ₱200 prize; N. Roxas of the
bureau of audits, winner of a P3,672
prize; M. V. de los Santos, pres¬
ident of the University of Manila,
winner of another P200 prize; Judge
M. Buyson-Lampa of Bacolor, Pam¬
panga, winner also of a P200 prize;
Madam E. Kollerman, head of a Ma¬
nila fashion school, and Teresita Le¬
desma of Iloilo, each a winner of a
₱1,000 prize.
The winners of the rest of the
three hundred thirty prizes are re¬
sidents in different sections of the
Islands, among whom are Amer¬
icans, Japanese, Chinese, Siamese,
Hindus, as well as Filipinos. It can
be stated here that the last sweep¬
stake race attracted considerable at¬
tention outside of the Philippines,
too. Requests for tickets to the race
came from several states on the
American continent, China, and
other neighboring countries.
An interesting feature of the
event is the participation of prom¬
nent government officials, business
en, lawyers, doctors, and other
rofessional people, as well as those
pf the lower class, down to the hum¬
ble rig driver. Members of the
ench, among them Associate Jus¬


tices Goddard and Diaz of the su¬
preme court, and lawmakers, such
as Senators Montinola and Zulueta,
were the possessors of quite a num¬
ber of tickets. Senator Montinola
purchased a batch of tickets for his
family. A certain big business man
is known to have bought hundreds
of tickets. Various government em¬
ployees and the personnel of a num¬
ber of private firms contributed in
the raising of funds for the pur¬
chase of tickets to the sweepstakes.
The employees in a prominent busi¬
ness firm succeeded in buying over
two thousand numbers. Everywhere
in the country there was a mutual
desire to participate in the big race.
It was no wonder that the tickets
were oversubscribed in a short time
and more had to be put out by the
P. A. A. F. to satisfy the insistent
demand of the public.
It may interest the readers to
know that the owners of the first
ticket, No, 12, the first eleven num¬
bers having been kept by the P. A.

A. F. as souvenirs, were Adriano
Rodenas of the bureau of treasury,
and Mrs. Isaac Barza, wife of "Bil¬
liken" Luz’ partner in the staging
of the first sweepstake in the Phil¬
ippines. It may also interest the
readers to know that the wooden
balls which were used in the
sweepst ake were imported
from New Orleans. It may be of
further interest to the readers to
know that the corps of newspaper
men and women and press photogra¬
phers who flocked to the San La¬
zaro race tracks last Sunday were
not free from the wave of specula¬
tion that gripped the sixty thousand
o so people at the hippodrome, for
they too possessed tickets and
nursed secret hopes of sudden opul¬
ence.
Although thousands of the spec¬
tators were disappointed by the fail-
ure of their tickets to win any of
the coveted prizes, those present at
the San Lazaro race tracks last
Sunday were satisfied with the al¬

most perfect way that the whole
program was carried out and were
convinced that everything was above
suspicion. Except for a few minor
delays and the excessive heat the
event may be said to be the master¬
piece of Messrs. Luz and Barza and,
not to omit, Acting Secretary of
Commerce and Agriculture Jorge

Early Sunday morning, accord-

number of National Volunteers men
began the laborious task of trans¬
porting the two hundred or so
frames bearing the numbered wood-
en balls from the shed where they
ere exhibited to the public days be¬
fore the race, to the big drum or
so-called tambiolo in the sorting
machine. By eleven o’clock the

BUURROROARS
To What 1934 Has In Store For Us


Mons. Finnemann: “The new yeur
bids fair to usher an era of peace and
tranquility.”
FrHE coming of every new year
is always an occasion for
many to look ahead and voice
new hopes, in the light of present
or past events. What has the year
1934 in store for us?
An internationally famous states¬
man predicts that there will be an¬
other world war. Sun Fo, president
of the Chinese legislative yuan and
son of the famous Sun Yat Sen, in a
conference with leading Chinese in
Manila, expressed the fear that
there will be another Sino-Japanese
war, and more, that it will involve
a number of Far Eastern nations,


including Russia and the Philip-
pines. General Emilio Aguinaldo,
speaking informally to a group of
friends recently, foretold a year as
crowded as any other in the past.
Interesting and significant events
are bound to transpire which, he
said, would bear watching, as they
will affect our political, economic,
and social life.
What has 1934 in store for us?
Religion
TYOPE PIUS, the supreme pon-
tiff of the Roman Catholic
1 Church, on the occasion of
the approach of the year 1934, ex¬
pressed the hope at the Vatican re¬
cently that the forthcoming year
will bring an end to the world’s po¬
litical and economic troubles, say¬
ing that the way out of the present
difficulties could be found through
Christianity.
Mons. William Finnemann, act¬
ing archbishop of the Philippines,
has similar hopes for 1934. He
said: “I am as enthusiastic about
the New Year as IIis Iloliness, the
Pope. Anybody with a discerning


L. R. Aguinaldo: “The future is
generally bright.”


mind and a spiritual consciousness
would say the same thing. The
New Year, to my mind, bids fair
to usher an era of peace and tran¬
quility. The Holy Year, which be¬
gan at the middle of 1933 and ends
at the close of April, 1934 will un¬
doubtedly mean to historians of the
future a period of spiritual revival.
This in itself should be a cause for
gladness of all Catholics, be they in
the Philippines or outside, of this
country.
The fact that there are more pil¬

test whether the people understa.

grims from the Philippines this
year to Rome than in any other
year in the past is an indication of
the growing interest in Catholicism
and in spiritual revival here. It
points to the place we are heading
for. Blessed are they who under¬
stand the signs and profit from
them."


Vice G.-G. Hayden: “The year 1934
is bound to be one of the most interest-
ing years in the lifetime of any person."


Business
LMOST all leading business
men are unanimous in the
Apelief that we are headed
for a more prosperous year. To be
sure, the worn-out hope about pros-
perity being just around the cor-
ner has been dropped by many.
Nevertheless, Manila business exe¬
cutives are now of the belief that
the signs of the times indicate that
the current promise of a better
year will be fulfilled.
Samuel Gaches, of the Heacock
interests, says: “The business out¬
look for 1934 is better than in
1933.” And he outlines his reasons
thus:
"First, because the people have
become accustomed to conditions
and have therefore lost the fear of
economic want.
“Second, the price levels of hemp
and copra are better at this time

Moros Now Clamor For Education


Whereas Formerly Moros Were
Reluctant To Send Their Children To
The Government Schools, They Are
Now Eager To Take Advantage Of The
Educational Opportunities Off ered-
Even Girl Pupils Are Increasing


By ILUMINADO SILAO
(Lando Correspondent of  )


FRHERE was a time when the
efforts to spread education
A
constituted an outstanding
failure in the Moro region. For
years, the indifference of Moro
parents toward the education of
their children was the chief draw¬
back of their own progress. Only
the persistent striving of the go¬
vernment has made possible the
conquest of that indifference. The
Moros, content in their ignorance
didi not seem to see any good in
the epportunities afforded by the
government.


forts for the education of their chil-
dren.
We can single out Sultan sa Dit¬
sa-an as an outstanding example of
a man who was once openly against
the sending of his children to the
public schools. At that time, he did
not see anything worth-while in the
educational system sponsored by
the government.
That was a few years ago. To¬
day, the same Sultan sa Ditsa-an is
the ardent supporter of education
among the Moros, not that he plays.
a part in the training of the young,


A group of Moro school children photagraphed with Mrs. Encabo, their teacher.


To-day, there is a different story
to tell. The same parents that un¬
wittingly were reluctant to open the
eyes of their children, so to speak,
are now clamoring for more schools
and better educational facilities.
Where before a mother forbade her
son from going to school, she now
conducts him herself to his classes
and makes it a point to ask the
teacher, almost every day, if her boy
is making any progress.
As a result the outlook is not
only encouraging but very bright
for these non-Christian brothers of
ours. Sultans, datus, and other
ranking personages in Moroland are
one and all making commendable ef¬


but because he is instrumental in in¬
ducing his people to have their chil¬
dren educated. And datus who were
formerly opposed to their children’s
getting any schooling are now emu¬
lating the example of Sultan sa
Ditsa-an.

There is no need of telling all
over again the part that Sultan sa
Ramain played, and is playing, in
educating Moro children. He was
one of the first Moro leaders to ad¬
vocate the education of his people
and was largely instrumental in the
building of more schools in Moro¬
land. Though unschooled himself,
he is nevertheless appreciative of
the value of higher learning. His
dream is to see his people educated
like their average Christian broth-
ers.
The present wave of enthusiasm
for the education of the Moro chil¬
dren can partly be attributed to the
heroic efforts of Eduard Kuder,
division superintendent of schools
for Lanao. With his co-operation
with the district supervisors and
Sultan sa Ramain, considerable pro¬
gress in Moro education has been
attained. It is expected that in a
few more years schools in all non¬
Christian provinces will be as
flourishing as those in any other
places in the Philippines.
At present, two of the most pro¬
gressive Moro schools in Lanao are
to be found in Ramain and Kapai
districts. The supervising teacher
of Kapai, Narciso Adeva, together
with the teachers, is largely respon¬
sible for the present enrollment of
Moro pupils. There are also no less
than twenty Moro freshmen in the
Lanao High School, besides a num-
ber of other Moro students now tak¬
ing vocational courses in Manila.


The enthusiasm of Moro parents
to educate their children is bound¬
less. It is said that mothers use to
accompany their children to, and
from, school. Mrs. Encabo, a
Grade I teacher in Ramain, nar¬
rates that while she conducts her
classes, parents of her pupils would
eagerly watch her class, squatting
on the floor. One would see the ex¬
pression of satisfaction on their
faces as they saw their young ones,
including girls, stand up to answer
the questions asked of them. Some
of these parents would wait till class
is over. Such interest is worthy of
the high commendation and is en¬
couraging.
Fourteen years ago, Ramain had

of the cit


 IKE the oft-mentioned bolt
from the blue came the opi¬
D nion rendered by Secretary
Teofilo Sison of the department of
interior and labor regarding the
exclusion of laborers from the be¬
nefits of the city retirement act
(Act No. 4085), and occasioned
impassioned demonstrations of
discontent by 500 wage-earners of
the city government and members
of their families. The ruling af¬
fords every citizen an opportunity
to look into an injustice which
finds few parallels.
The reason for the discontent is
not hard to find. We have here the
distressing case of over 500 aged
laborers of Manila who have
served the city for years ranging
from five to thirty-eight, and who
are expected to be “given the gate”
sometime this month. In accord-
ance with the reorganization of the
city government, they will be duly
separated from the different depart-
ments of the city government be¬
ginning with this first month of
1934. The majority of them are
poor, meager-carning men who,
their respective foremen said, have
been generally devoted to their work,
Unlike highly paid, easy-going em¬
ployees of the city or the insular
government, they will face the first
months of 1934 with neither jobs
nor money. While civil service em¬
ployees, still strong and generally
opulent after years of service, re¬
ceive gratuities once upon being
separated from the service, poor and


in some cases old Manila laborers
will be turned out without even,
so to say, a sou to their names. For,
as already stated, the cabinet, at the
recommendation of the secretary of
interior and labor, and the city en¬
gineer have ruled out Manila labor¬
ers from those who are entitled to
gratuities.
When the city retirement act was


framed during the last sessions of
the legislature, Rep. Fortunato de
Leon stated that he, as well as other
members of the committee on the
city government, had included Ma¬
nila laborers within the scope to be
benefited by the act. “I was sur¬
prised when 1 read in the papers
the other day,” he told the GRAPH-
IC, “that Secretary Sison had ruled
to exclude Manila laborers from the
list of those who will be entitled to
gratuities when they are retired
from the government. When we
framed the bill, we included Mani¬
la laborers among those who should
receive the bounties of the law, in¬
asmuch as they deserve such
benefits most. The spirit of the law
carries with it the assumption that
those who have served the govern¬
ment should be properly rewarded
when they leave the service, or that
those who are to become unemploy-
ed on account of the reorganization
should be, if to a limited extent
only, provided for. Why and how
it came about that the cabinet or
Secretary Sison should rule that
laborers are not entitled to any
gratuity, is strange to me.” Accord-
ing to the Bataan solon, the opinion
of Secretary Sison is a clear disre¬
gard of the spirit behind the retire¬
ment act and the reorganization


law.
Looked upon from the humanita¬
rian viewpoint, the thing is as
strange to the people as it is to Rep.
Fortunato de Leon.
Let us cite specific cases in order


Secretary Teofilo Sison: ruled to ex¬
clude Manila laborers from the li
those entitled to gratuities when thay
are retired from the gavernment.
to make the situation more vivid.
Policarpio Macapagal, according to
the records of the department of
city engineering, has been a grave¬
digger for the city of Manila since
1895, or at least thirty-eight years.
He is now 61 years old, and accord¬
ing to old employees of the depart-
ment of city engineering, Macapa¬
gal has been absent only about
twice during his 38 years in the
employ of the City of Manila and
has been doing his job as compe¬
tently as any laborer of the depart¬
ment. The head of the office, Mr.
Cheek, has placed his name among
those who are to be retired on ac¬
count of the fact that he is already
weak and old. Young men could do
his work quicker than he could and
for that reason it would be advan¬
tageous to put a younger man in his
place, according to city hall offi¬
cials. When he gets retired, how¬
ever, he will not get any gratuity at
all. For as already indicated the
city government, in the opinion of
the secretary of interior and labor,
cannot authorize a single centavo of
gratuity for him.
For the sake of contrast, let us
now examiine the case of a former
cabinet member. As secretary of


Above are dismissed government employees maiting far tha gratuity due them.
llike the five hundred or sa Manila laborers who are denied their gratuities, these
employees have, in some way at least, bean benefited hy the reargunization.

a department, he received P1,000 a
month. He entered the service of
the government on August 13, 1901,
and resigned last year. A man of
ample means, one who was appar¬
ently well-paid, and with a new
olum position given him by a pri¬
vate enterprise upon his leaving the
government, he nevertheless receiv¬
ed from the latter a gift of about
P20,000.00. If the retirement act
was intended to reward, or to pro¬
vide for, those who are rendered
unemployed thereby, then its pur¬
pose was defeated in both the cabi¬
net man and the Macapagal case.
The city retirement act, Secretary
Sison admits, is entirely patterned
after the insular retirement act, so
that even if one is an insular of¬
ficial and the other a mere laborer
of the city government, it still fol¬
lows that both cases are to be
treated identically.
More cases could be mentioned to
provide more illustrations of con¬
trasts. Among the 255 persons
which the department of city en¬
gineering (excluding the depart
ments of streets and bridges) who
have been listed for retirement are:
Lucas de Leon, 68 years old, with
32 years of service.
Saturnino Gorra, 57 years old,
with 31 years of service.
Atanacio Puala, 64 years old,
with 30 years of service.
Ramon Vidal, 59 years old, with
29 years of service.
Luis Barroga, aged 44, with 30
years of service.
Antonio Pano, with 30 years of
service.
Domingo Navarro, aged 54, with
32 years of service.
Melecio Vergara, aged 54, with 32
years of service.
Other city laborers who are to be
rendered both jobless and penniless
could be listed down. On the other
hand consider employees of the in-
sular government. Examples are
abundant of employees who, al¬
though highly paid and still strong
enough to engage in various occupa¬
tions, have been retired with hand¬


some gratuities. Among the latest
names to be added to the already
long list of officials who have been
retired are Stanton Youngberg, who
was receiving P12,000 per annum,
and David C. Kretzer, who was re¬
ceiving P5,000 annually, (minus the
15% reduction provided for in the
reorganization law).
Both Secretary Sison and City
Engineer Artiaga admit that the
exclusion of the laborers from those
who will be benefited by the retire¬
ment law is unjust and unfair.
Both, however, based their opinion


on the illegality of retiring them
with gratuities. "Laborers," accord-
ing to Secretary Sison, “are not
classified under civil service rules
and are not therefore meant to be
included in the reorganization act.”
The reason for the exclusion of
Manila laborers, explains City En¬
gineer Santiago Artiaga, "is simple.
I expect to retire some 500 of them
at the beginning of the year (this
was before New Year), but I expect
to get some 600 younger men to
take their places. The employment
of new and younger laborers is im¬

City Engineer Artiaga: “The ren

perative, as the city is growing year
after year. Under the reorganiza¬
tion law, positions vacated by men
who were given gratuities are to ba
left unfilled. However, if the city
government retires men, in this
fashion, the functions of the depart-
ment of city engineering will be
paralyzed, as then it would be ille¬
gal for us to employ new laborers to
take the places of those retired.”
As a whole, the ruling against
the retiring laborers of the city
government is premised on certain
legal complications offered in cer¬
tain sections of the city reorganiza
tion law. But with a number of
Manila councilors behind the move¬
ment to present the case of the lab¬
orers to the governor-general, it is
expected that something could still
be done in behalf of the five hun¬
dred wage-earners who will be af¬
fected. Although both 'Secretary
Sison and City Engineer Artiaga
announced that the subject is al¬
ready a closed one, rumblings of
discontentment will continue to be
heard from the ranks of Manila’s
poorly-paid, ill-treated laborers.

The Girl on Florida


By SINAI C. HAMADA


F NIGHTS, SOMETIMES,
O when a soft new moon hangs
over Ermita, comes doleful music
stealing from one of the backdoors
of the tenements behind Florida.
You stop to listen, wonder breath-
lessly for a moment, then breathe
again and move on with an aching
heart. You never know who is
playing on the piano from any hid¬
den corner, touching your heart.
You dare not find out who, or the
picture would haunt you days
afterwards.
Before daylight gilds the dawn-
ing skies, the cake vendor, bend¬
ing under his never-lightened
burden, cries from the street to
the deaf ears of those still cozily
reposed in bed.
On Sunday morning, veiled
faces are seen, and devout-looking
people walk, on the street. It is
so quiet on Sundays, without the
bustle and mad rush of week¬
days. Even the acacia trees, mo¬
tionless, seem in pious communion.
Isaac Peral, intersecting Florida,
then looks the most beautiful street
in Manila.... deserted, shady and
cool throughout, with only specks of
sunshine here and there, to tell that
the sun is in a clear sky looking
down on a worshipping world. Flo¬
rida offers no comparison to Isaac
Peral when it comes to splendid
charm.
JELL NOW, THERE is a girl
Won Florida, simple yet attrac-
tive, almost beautiful, I think. I
imagine she must be really beauti¬
ful—I have never known her wel
enough. They call her Marcela—or
Cela, for short.
She is a, waitress. She waits on
co-eds at ene of the restaurants
along Florida. She is this low, alas
.. . . yet if she were a co-ed herself,
who knows but that nine or ten
sleek-haired college sheiks would be
hot after her....
A year ago, we were standing at
the door of "Florida Lunch” one
evening, listening to the radio. My
friend tapped me and said, "Who
is that girl?”
“I do not know. She is a waitress
down here,” I replied.
My friend had just come from
the province to study in the Normal
School, and Jbeing townmates, we
roomed together at the College
Quarters. He is an Igorot boy, very
ordinary, quiet, but likeable in his
native way. Pedro is that sort of
student who is passive about his
studies, "takes 'em easy, then leaves
'em.” His father had wanted him
to go on to the University, but Pe¬


URS IS A SHORT street,
bordering the U. P. cam¬
pus. From Isaac Peral to
Padre Faura, where Flo¬
rida street is cut off, there ex¬
tends but about three hundred
meters.


But Florida, though not a very
long street, is full of interesting
people. I think there is no street
in the world quite like it. And the
name Florida itself is so singular¬
ly attractive. Why, even when you
merely think of the state of Flori¬


da in America, the very name sug¬
gests florid summer, gay people of
all sorts, and long, sandy shores
with many palm trees.
Of course, Florida street in
Manila is nothing like the state of
Florida in the United States. Oh,
no. Far from it. Nevertheless, as
I have said, it is interesting, very
interesting. Later in your life,
you will meet people elsewhere in
the Islands who will tell you of
Florida in Ermita, Manila.
Alas, when the names of many
streets are changed in the future,
cither through some patriotic
move, or for any whimsical reason,
Florida may not be called its pres¬
ent name any more. But I wish, if
ever most of our street names are
Filipinized, or “other-ized,” they
would leave Florida alone, al¬
though Kansas, or Carolina, or
Tennessee, and other such foreign
names may be stricken out. Flo¬
rida is really different from all
these. It is Filipino, sort of. Flo¬
rida calls to mind tropical bloom,
and eternal sunshine, and blue
skies. Pon’t you think so?
VELL, I SUPPOSE YOU would
like to know what interest¬
ing people there are along Flori¬
da—for me to rave of this street
so much. However, let me say
here, it is not alone people that
makes Florida a curious thorough¬
fare. Of course, lots of students
in the prosaic garb of collegiate
boys and girls, are daily seen
passing by, singly or in pairs or
groups. Yet, only one or two of
these many students may be what
you would call individuals, having
that arresting strangeness about
them we seldom find among the
hundreds of people we come
across anywhere.
Of those, who are, in a way, in¬
digent to Florida—I do not mean
the provincial students — many
many are amusing, some are ro¬
mantic characters, others are sim¬
ply carefree beings. There are: a
hunchback who is a sartorial art-
ist; a Hindu merchant far, far
more materialistic than Gandhi
perhaps ever dreamed to be while
a student at Oxford; a good-look¬
ing woman from far-away Pana¬
ma; cobblers; a poker-faced stu¬
dent worth possibly a bogus dime;
an unalterably Japanese subject;
Chinese running sari-sari stores;
a beggar-woman, with her ever¬
present basket of rags, sitting at
dusk where students would pass
her by, begging insistently, calling
you “senorito.

It seems but natural that after Shelley, we should introduce to such as
“follow” this column, Keats—if one could at all speak of "introducing" a
poet whose name, belying his modest self-written epitaph, is certainly far
from "writ in water.” We reproduce one of his great sonnets, as well
as the most famous stanza of his beautiful “Ode to a Nightingale”;
On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer
MUCH have I travell'd in the realms of gold
And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne:
Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
-Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
When a new planet swims into his ken;
Or like stout Cortez—when with eagle eyes
He stared at the Pacific—and all his men
Lool'd at each other with a wild surmise—
Silent, upon a peak in Darien.
Ode to a Nightingale
A HOU wast not born for death, immortal Bird!
No hungry generations tread thee down;
The voice I hear this passing night was heard
In ancient days by emperor and clown:
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
The same that oft-times hath
Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
—JOHN KEATS


dro said all he cared for was to be
a plain school teacher, so he was
going to finish his studies in the
Normal School, then return to the
province and raise chickens all his
life—aside from teaching, of course.
Two years at the Normal School,
he had calculated, would surely
make of him a tolerable teacher.
This was June of last year. Mar¬
cela then did not look as pretty as
she does now. Her dresses were not
cut so neatly or nicely. They wer
drab, home-made, of dry white cot¬
ton. Her jet-black hair was parted
towards the right, not very well be¬
coming her. She was not particu¬
larly fascinating then.
However, Pedro, as though with
a sixth perceptive sense, seemed to
have divined at once something in
her, discerning her potentialities.
Maybe it was her simplicity, or
some magic charm she possessed, not
to be easily discovered.
Anyway, after a time, Marcela
would notice Pedro often looking at
her—from the door—with unmis¬
takable interest. She was embar¬
rassed at first, but later, she grew
to like the way he would peep at her
through the door.
Consequently, consciously or un¬
consciously, she changed subtly me¬
tamorphosing as though under his
power and surveillance. She must
have been flattered that a decent-
looking student like Pedro should
pay her any attention.
She changed her mode of dress¬
ing. She still wore simple but now
neatly trimmed dresses, patterned
after the co-eds'. They were mostly
green, with two or three chocolate¬
colored, organdy dresses. In these
garments, she would look lovely.
Too, she parted her hair in the
middle now, showing how lustrous it
was, and baring her shapely, queen¬
ly forehead. Her cheeks were full.
She could smile bloomingly.
((CAY," REMARKED PEDRO
W once, after we had known
her for some time. "Doesn’t she
look like Sylvia Sidney?”
“Uhuh,” I assented, fancying
some real resemblance. "“I never
noticed it before, though.”
"You know, I am becoming fond
of her,” he confessed. "She is—
what shall I say?—unadorned, but
lovely, so unspoiled."
I could only concur with him and
say, “Yes, I think so.”
‘I think I shall love her,” he said
meditatively.
“Go ahead. You won’t have a
hard time winning her,” I said,
meaning no offense.
"You think so?”
“Of course. Why, she’d only be
too glad—considering her station—
to accept you,” I said candidly.
“But that wouldn’t mean she’s
cheap—?"
“Oh, no. Not that. What is wrong
about loving a girl after your own
heart?”
“They say truly love is blind,” he
sighed, smiling ironically.
Marcela was behind us. Pedro


glanced back. She smiled at him.
He was satisfied, and we went
away.
T ALL BEGAN THIS WAY: At
first, they would merely smile
at each other. Later, they became
more intimate, then Pedro would
drop in occasionally, when there
were not so many customers, to
tease Cela. He would talk with her
casually over the counter. He would
tell her she was lovely, she was
sweet, she was adorable, etc. Their
eyes would meet in tender looks,
then she would feel, and he would
feel, she was true, he was true.
Funny, Pedro told me once he
dated Marcela one evening to see
“Young Nowheres” at the Bellevue,
and there they clasped hands under¬
standingly while the show was go¬
ing on. On their way back, he led
her through one of the dimly light-
ed streets, and tried to kiss her. She
did not want to be kissed, and she
had cried, Pedro said.
“I did kiss her finally, though,
Pedro went on. “But I repented so
much afterwards, I had to go to her
to beg forgiveness, and I cried too.
Then she was glad."


So it went,
PODAY, THEY STILL love each
other, Pedro and Marcela.
This October, Pedro will finish at
the Normal School, having had ad¬
vance credits.
You should see Marcela present¬
ly. She has grown lovelier than
ever. Probably some college boys
would now like to win her, though
as you know, she already belongs to
Pedro. She is such a lovable creat¬
ure, we boys affectionately call her
“the girl on Florida," varying "girl”
with “queen" sometimes.
As to Florida, it is the same old
street, clouded with dust on rainless
days. In the evening, children skate
over the concrete sidewalk, laugh,
sing. Or, sometimes, when the sky
is shadowy, then the poet from his
window sill at the attic room of the
Bachelor’s Hall sighs longingly and
looks far away, beyond the sunset
it seems, and sings silent songs.
But to return to Pedro and Mar¬
cela. They will doubtless marry as
soon as Pedro graduates from the
Normal School.
“It won’t be long now,” Pedro

Y T is customary, as the new year
A dawns, to appraise what has
been done during the one just
past. Accordingly, I shall take it
upon myself to evaluate, in relation
to 1933, two of the things that in-
terest me most.
One of them is Philippine litera-
ture in English. In the U. S. A.,
outstanding literary productions of
each year are collected in an antho¬
logy called “The American Cara¬
van.” In Europe, they have “The
European Caravan.” Lately, there
has even appeared “The Oriental Ca¬
ravan.” But needless (alas!) to
say, it does not cover the Philip-
pines.
Locally, there are no publishers
willing to put out, regularly and at
their own risk, books other than
those used in classrooms. But if
there were one, it is safe to say
that we could present a not at all
bad “Philippine Caravan.” Desul-
tory as my reading was of native
works during 1933, I chanced upon
quite a number of worth-while
pieces.
They may not be the best Filipino
poems of the year, but somehow, two
sonnets persist in clinging to my
memory: “My Wife's Hands” (Li
terary Apprentice) by Conrado S.
Ramirez and “There Must be Heav-
en" (Leader) by Salvador P. Lopez.
No particular poem by Trinidad L.
Tarrosa affected me in the same
way; but I could not but notice the
progress she made during 1933. She
still betrays rough edges here and
there; but she has peculiar intensi¬
ty.
Many first-rate short-stories ap¬
peared during the year, several of
them from the pen of Bienvenido
N. Santos. But I wonder if he, too,
will practically retire after a none
too long period of prolixity—as
happened in the case of many of
his predecessors. One need not go
as far back as Paz Marquez Beni¬
tez, Loreto Paras, or Casiano T.
Calalang for an example. Even
those of a more recent group of
writers are hardly heard from now.
An instance is Manuel E. Arguilla
—whose “Midsummer” (Philippine
Magazine), by the way, is one of
1933’s finest Filipino stories
In the field of the familiar es¬
say, a decided advance was regis¬
tered. Ignacio F. Lim evinced
promise in a couple of pieces, as did
Ben Dizon Garcia in "On Making
Acquaintances” (Woman's Home
Journa!). “Sonia” (Serap Book) by
F. B. Icasiano, "On Parsing” (Spec¬
trum) by Maria Angela Ansaldo
“On Being Ashamed of One’s Past"

Are COLLEGIANS After HERESSES?


A Symposium On The Desirability Of Rich Girls As
Wives For Poor College Graduates
By N. U. GATCHALIAN


rT is true and everybody knows
that impoverished nobilities of
1 England and Europe have ex¬
changed their titles for the millions
of American heiresses. And it is
a proven fact that these matches
seldom bear fruits of happiness.
The usual result is divorce. There
is no doubt that the peers involved
have for background high social
standing, castles, and titles handed
down from generation to genera¬
tion. Yet, they do not have money,
hence the search for rich American
heiresses. On the other hand, the
American heiresses want only social
position and a title. Consequently
there is none of that mutual meet¬
ing of hearts from which happiness
springs.
But in our midst, could there be
similar cases? There is a notion
that college boys burn the midnight
lamp in order that in the great
hunt for a wife, they could use their
acquired degrees or “titles" to bait
heiresses. That is, their college
training is used only as a means
to an end.
But in reality, collegians do not
seem particularly partial to heires¬


ses. If anything, these boys are in¬
different to this class of girls.
They study in colleges and univer¬
sities to obtain degrees, not to de¬
corate their names to attract rich
girls, but to make a decent living
in order to be independent. At least,
that is what views compiled by the
writer indicate.
There is Alfonso A. Anonas of
the Philippine Law School, Nation¬
al University, and cousin to Under¬
Secretary G. Anonas. He just turn¬
ed a cold shoulder when offered a
rich girl as bride.
“What do I care for an heiress?
She’d only make a puppy out of me.
The vain aristocrat might think that
I married her for her 'dough.”
Marrying a rich girl would merely
make you cheap in the eyes of the
people who know you and your
wife’s social and financial standing.


I prefer a woman who is of, or be¬
low, my level financially and social¬
ly. Then and only then, I think,
could I live in perfect conjugal
bliss." And taking a snapshot from
the drawer of his desk in his office,
he continued: “This is the girl I’m
going to marry. She is taking edu¬
cation in a local private university.
She is not rich, but she loves me.
I’d not exchange her heart for a
million dollars. No, sir!”
In the Jose Rizal College, I came
across Celerino T. Venadas, a senior
commerce student. He is a stout
and jolly fellow, brimful of wise¬
cracks.
“How would you like a femme
with bags of gold in the family
vault for a life partner?” I asked
him, after an exchange of jokes.
“How would I like poison for a
consideration?” he replied, his huge


body shaking with laughter. "An
heiress for a wife? What a calami¬
ty! Formerly a rich girl was my
dream, but I have changed radically
and permanently. Here is the story
of what made me do so.” He became
sober: “I know a man who married
a rich girl from the South. He was
very happy, because his dream had
come true. But after several
months of married life, I received a
letter from him telling me of his
woes. He said that his soul is being
murdered gradually. He has re¬
pented marrying rich—too late.
His in-laws do not consider him as
a member of the family. He is a
stranger in the house of his rich
wife, because he is poor while she
is a social luminary. When an in¬
vitation comes for a social gather¬
ing, it is issued in her name. Can
you beat that! He wanted to leave,
but could not: he loves her more
than anything else. He’s a good
warning for anybody who aspires
to get a rich wife.”
Jose R. Caruncho, of the Institute
of Accounts, Business, and Finance,
would not object to an heiress pro¬
vided she was not haughty and of

a domineering nature. Also she
should believe in the superiority of
the husband as the one in authority.
“If I fell truly in love with a girl,
I wouldn’t care whether she was
rich or not. The only thing that
matters with me is her love. But she
must respect me. Generally speak¬
ing, it is better to get one who is of
the same social status. But love is
blind, and mine will not be an excep¬
tion to the rule. The only thing I’d be
afraid of in marrying a girl as poor
as I am is what would happen should
I lose my job. You see, there is an
advantage in marrying a rich girl.
If you are kicked out, you don’t
need to worry about your family's
facing starvation, for she would
have the means to carry the ship
through the storm until you can do
the task yourself.” Yet, on the
whole, he prefers an ordinary girl
to a rich one. He likes rich ones as
friends, but that’s all. Jose is very
particular about man’s individuali¬
ty and superiority.
Ramon Peralta, Jr., a senior stud¬
ent in architecture at the Mapua
Institute of Technology, had the
following to say:
“Rich wives are curses to their
poor husbands who were blinded by
the glitter of gold. It won’t do to
forfeit a man’s right as a ruler of
the home for a girl’s bags of gold.
There is no use in acquiring college
training if it would be used only
as a bait to catch a rich girl to sup¬
port you the rest of your life, so
that you will not stand on your own
feet, challenging the entire world
for the battle of existence. Once
you have married a rich wife,
your self-respect and pride as a man
will be swallowed by her promin-
ence, and everything would be dif-
ferent. She would make you a slave.
You would be reduced to nothing
except as an accessory to her exist-
ence. That would be the most
heinous sin a man could conmit—
selling himself. This reminds me of
a friend who married the daughter
of a sugar magnate. I met him re¬
cently in the city looking for a job.
Upon being questioned, he narrated
to me everything. He said that
since marrying the rich heiress, he
had led a dog’s life. Instead of en¬
joying the anticipated comfortable
life of the husband of a rich girl, he
became miserable. He was made a
foreman of the plantation workers
of the family, was an outcast at
social functions, ate his meals all
alone after his wife and her

a misunderstanding takes place,
where to get off—or that he would
be nothing without her. The man
is powerless, has no voice in the ad¬
ministration of the house."
Pedro Revilla, debonair son of the
late Judge B. Revilla and a lav
student in the University of Sto.
Tomas, is also an ardent, or shal
I say a die-hard, opponent of the
marrying-rich plan. When I opened
the subject, he began telling me of
his experiences in a certain pros¬
perous province where he had spent
an entire long vacation. He lam¬
basted the mestizos in that rich re¬
gion, who traded their physical at¬
tributes for the gold of homely
spinsters, and then spent the mon¬
ey of their wives to dissipate.
When asked what he would do if
he were engaged to an heiress, he
replied:
“Me? Marry an heiress? Pre¬
posterous! Before offering a wed¬
ding ring to a wealthy girl, I’d join
the French Foreign Legion first—
or do something equally desperate!
Otherwise, gossipers would enter¬
tain the false idea that I took her
for a meal ticket! Besides that
tragedy, she would lead me by the
nose. The transition would be
from a real he-man to a weather-
cock which faces in any direction
the wind blows. Just now I’m
earning enough for a decent living
for an ordinary family and for a
law course. Why then should I
choose to marry a rich girl who


would tell me what to do and what
not to do?”
In the opinion of Pedro Kitain,
1933 oratorical contest winner of
the National Law College, U. M.,
and the presiding officer of that
university’s student council, a rich
wife is sometimes useful and bene¬
ficial in one way or another. He
has these explanations to offer:
“A happy home can’t live alone
on love. There must be a supply
for the rice and fish to keep that
love burning. I’m not very sure
whether I’d really like to marry a
rich heiress or not. But if I ever
marry a rich girl, she must be good
enough for me, kind to the poor,
and would care to stay in my house
no matter how humble it may be.
A poor college graduate has this
advantage in marrying a rich girl:
the road to success would not be so
rough for him. He has the means of
his wife to start with in the effort
to conquer the world. It is true that
the money is hers, but whatever it
may bring will be for both of them
and for their children, if any. The
relation would be like a partnership:
she, the capitalist, and he, the one
operating the business for mutual
benefit. The man’s ambition is also
her ambition, therefore she has no
ground for abuses. Just give her
all the love she wants and every¬
thing will be rosy. The only disad-
vantage in marrying a rich woman

Horse-riding was, and still is, a com¬
mon means of transportation in the Is¬
lands, as attested by the top phota. This
methad of transpertation entails the need
af saddles; and locally we have Bantay,
Hocos Sur, as a source of saddles. The
young man in the lower photo is mahing
saddles.
T the race tracks one easily
notices the jockeys in their
pright-colored uniforms ri¬
ding the wind. One also notices
the thin, glossy saddles on which
sit these riders of the turf. Then
again, along the beach or the high-
way of early mornings, one sees
milady and probably a companion
horse-riding. The pair seem to be
comfortably enjoying themselves,
astride the shiny, new sadd'es over
their cantering steeds. Beside a
lonely trail in the hinterland a
traveler unsaddles his tired horse,
puts aside the old, worn-out saddle,
and camps for the night.
Horse-riding is no longer what it
used to be, what with the coming of
high-powered cars and the con-
struction of better roads, but it has
not by any means gone out com¬
pletely. In the uplands of the coun-
try, where the old trails still re-
main, horse-riding is still as of old
days, while in the lowlands it has
become chiefly linked with pleasure.
But this article is not exactly about
horse-riding; rather is it about one
of its "incidentals"—saddle-making.


Bantay’s
Offhand one would say that the
saddles used in the Islands come
from abroad. This is misleading,
however. While it is true that we
do import saddles from abroad, it is
equally true that part of the supply
is manufactured locally. Where
saddles are made and how they are
made constitute an interesting
story.
The town of Bantay in Ilocos Sur
is not only noted for being the home
town of Diego Silang, one of the
figures, but also for its saddle in¬
dustry. Of course, the place has
weaving, sawali-making, to men¬
formerly most remunerative indus¬
tries is saddle-making.
A word about Bantay is in order.
This small town has a population inces of northern Luzon. In Ma¬
and was a part of Vigan during concern that regularly buys Bantay
by the Gobantes dike. The town
got its name, no doubt, from its
numerous hills, for the vernacular
word "bantay” means mountain in
English.
At present there are about seven
saddle factories in Bantay. These
factories employ more than thirty
workers. A saddler is paid for
every saddle that he makes, usual¬
ly ₱0.50. An ordinary saddler
makes an average of two saddles a
day. Work in the factories con¬
tinues throughout the year, except
during rainy days, when work is
suspended.
The leather used in the manufac-
ture of saddles, cow leather of
course, comes principally from Ca¬
pangpangan, a barrio of Vigan,
where tanning and slipper-manufac-
turing are the chief industries. At
this writing a good-sized piece of
leather, which can be made into
three regular saddles, costs from
P5.50 to P6.50.
At current prices, a saddle sells
from P3.50 to P4.00. Four or five
years ago a saddle sold from P5.50
to P6.00. As can be readily seen,
there has been a sharp fall in of Bantay is still on its feet, it has
commodities have fallen, too. How¬


ever, in view of the fact that Ban-
country’s most colorful historical tay is the only town engaged in
the saddle industry in northern
Luzon, the fall in prices has not
other industries—farming, cloth- caused the industry to go into the
doldrums. As a matter of fact hun¬
tion some—but one of its oldest and dreds of saddles are still being man¬
ufactured in Bantay every year and
are sold in different parts of the Is¬
lands, particularly in the prov¬
of about fifteen thousand people, nila, there is at least one business
the Spanish regime. It is close to saddles. The saddlers of Bantay
Vigan, both towns being connected suffer but a slight competition,


and at that not from those in any
other town of the country but from
abroad, particularly the United
States.
But although the saddle industry
prices, but then the prices of other been losing ground steadily. This
started years ago when the first


motor vehicles were introduced
here. Before this, horse-riding was
popular among the inhabitants, and
saddles were much in demand. The
roads were bad and few, and travel¬
ing in the hilly regions could be
done only by means of horses. With
the coming of motor cars, however,
more and better roads were con¬
structed. Automobiles superseded
horses. This affected the saddle
industry to a great extent. The
coming of saddles from abroad, es¬
pecially from the United States,
completed the downward trend of


the local saddle industry. More¬
over, the cost of materials rose
with the fall in prices.
Whether or not the saddle indus¬
try will eventually close shop re¬
mains to be seen. The saddlers are
indeed in a sorry plight. However,

Can “Seconds” Succeed?


Dolores del Rin: unlike Lupe Velez,
"second Dolores del Rio,” she seems
to be losing box office appeal.
y AST week, we saw how actors
groomed to succeed or at least
E to compete with reigning idols
fared. Now let’s see how actresses
have succeeded—or failed—under
similar circumstances.
Let us begin with Greta Garbo.
who draws the masses with her
unique personality and the recogni¬
tion of the critics with her undoubt¬
ed ability. She is a real box office
attraction, the best proof of which
is that she started the still growing
list of "second Garbos.” Scan
screen faces, past and present, and
you will notice the Garbo influence
in such players as Marlene Dietrich,
Elissa Landi, Tallulah Bankhead,
Joan Crawford, Katherine Hepburn.
Lil Dagover, Tala Birell, Juliette
Compton, Sari Maritza, Lilian Har¬
vey, and others. Many of these ac¬
tresses have become successful in
their own right. But it is despite,
not because, of comparison with the
great Garbo.
The opposite of the Swedish star,
as a personality, is Janet Gaynor,
who specializes in idyllic roles. First
attracting attention in “The Johns¬
town Flood,” this petite Fox player
created a furore in that beautiful
romance, “Seventh Heaven," with
boyish Charles Farrell. She and
Charlie were teamed following that
memorable picture, but even when
eventually the combination broke
up, Janet retained a goodly meas¬
ure of her popularity. In fact, she
has scored hits without benefit of
Farrell. An outstanding example is


"Daddy Long Legs.”
But as comedians soon hanker for
serious roles and vamps come to
long for good-girl characters to por¬
tray, so did Janet grow to wish for
pictures that would not require her
to be sweet and wistful. Thus it
was that, unexpectedly, she refused
to play in “Rebecca of Sunnybrook
Farm,” which was along the same
lines as "Daddy Long Legs.” There¬
upon, Marian Nixon—who is also of
the unsophisticated type—was sub¬
stituted. She made good, said the
critics—but she was no Janet Gay¬
nor, the public in effect stated
Meanwhile, Janet essayed a compa¬
ratively mature role in “The First
Year.” She did very well, but it
seems that her fans just couldn’t
swallow the Diane of “Seventh
Heaven" as a married woman. So,
when "Paddy, the Next Best Thing"
was made, Janet was again her
usual screen self—with Warner
Baxter, her leading man in "Daddy
Long Legs," playing opposite.
Talking of the Janet Gaynor type,
do you remember Mary Philbin?
Years ago, she sprang into promi¬
nence when Erich von Stroheim
discovered her for “Merry-Go¬
Round.” As the appealingly inno¬
cent heroine of that picture, Miss
Phiibin caused a sensation, justify¬
ing Stroheim’s decision to give her
an extraordinary “break.” Yet the
very picture which "made” Miss
Philbin made Stroheim sever his
connections with the producing
company, Universal. There was


cing company
Clara Baw: a p
rodu
"second Clara
chose Alice White
Bow,” but Alice did not click.


some disagreement during produc¬
tion, and the director stepped out
before the picture’s completion.
Later, he made a similar picture—
and again, with a new star. Her
name was Fay Wray; but while in
no way inferior to Miss Philbin, she
did not cause a like sensation. How¬
ever, Miss Wray has at least been
able to do what Miss Philbin has
not: remained on the screen.
Incidentally, that is a feat which
Dolores del Rio appears to be find¬
ing difficult to accomplish. And
yet, the Mexican star was very pop¬
ular once upon time. This was fol¬
lowing her splendid work in "What
Price Glory" and “Resurrection."
With the advent of the talkies, how¬
ever, she lost ground perceptibly.
On the other hand, another Mexi¬
can actress, Lupe Velez, who has


Marlene Dietrich: has succeeded
tht despite her being
in her own n
billed as a "second Garbo.”


been compared more than once with
la del Rio, is still doing fairly well.
Whereas Dolores’ practically only
success in talkies was “Bird of
Paradise,” Lupe hit the mark in
several pictures, one of them the
talkie version of “Resurrection" it¬
self....
There was a time when Clara
Bow’s fan mail was said to be the
largest in Hollywood. Exponent
of the Jazz Age, she ruled long
and widely as Paramount’s hot
party girl. Naturally, there de¬
veloped a search for a "second Cla¬
ra Bow.” One producing compa¬
ny’s choice fell on Alice White. But
Alice did not click.
Clara herself almost passed out
literally when scandals beset her
and she quit the screen temporari¬
ly. She was to have played with
Gary Cooper in “City Streets,” but
since she stepped out, a newcomer
from the stage took her place.
That newcomer is now known far


HOLLYWOCD ECHOES
OES screen history repeat it¬
self? In the old days, they
say, Gloria Swanson and
Pola Negri disputed the queenship
of the Paramount lot. Now, they
also say, the rivals on the same
premises are Mae West and Mar¬
lene Dietrich. The latter started
Hollywood tongues a-gossiping
when, upon her return from a va¬
cation in Europe, papers quoted
her as saying: “I never heard of
Mae West!”
Miss West discounted the ru¬
mored statement. Remarked the
full-figured star:
Miss Dietrich is too intelligent
to show any jealousy toward me,
even if she felt it—and I know she
doesn’t. We aren’t at all alike on
the screen.... She said it for pub¬
licity? Nonsense—to show jealou¬
sy of an actress on the same lot
would not be good publicity!” Mae
also narrated that Marlene used to
come to her (Mae’s) dressing room
and tell her how she (Marlene
and her daughter, Maria, played
Mae’s songs at home.
On her part, Miss Dietrich de-
nied that she released the state¬
ment attributed to her. She ex¬
plained that, being asked about the
effect of Mae West fashions on
Paris, she replied: “I never heard
of Mae West fashions."”
This seems to have made mat-
ters worse, for Miss West was re¬
ported as retorting: “What, she
never heard of Mae West fashions?
Why, she wore them herself in her
last picture, 'Song of Songs'!
even heard that she wore my cor¬
set so she could show the Mae
West curves. But, of course, you'd
have to verify that from the ward¬
robe department."
Said wardrobe department scout¬
ed the idea, pointing out that
while Marlene did wear a corset in
peasant scenes of "Song of Songs,”

and wide as Sylvia Sidney. For
the handicap of being a "second”
has not stopped her from climbing
up and up, scoring in such first¬
rate pictures as "Ladies of the Big
House,” “An American Tragedy,"
“Madame Butterfly,” “Jennie Ger¬
hardt,” etc. However, another
"second Clara Bow,” Peggy Shan¬
non, has been less fortunate.
So there you are. Can "seconds”
succeed? The answer is, “Yes—
and no.” You see, there’s no tell¬
ing what the fans will like,

Locally, wond always brings to
mind only such things as building mat¬
erials, furniture, and fuel. But in the
ore advanced countries, wood is utilized
n the manufacture of diversa products.
Abave are phonogra
 records, rope and
twine, and linolem
few samples a
articles made from wood.
Y y OOD, which has long been
 regarded as valuable
mainly for bunding
houses and furniture, is now the
basis of many products that would
have seemed ridiculous and im¬
possible a few years ago.
Not only are cattle food and a
transparency that becomes a part of
giass derived irom wood or its re¬
sunants, but aiso sugar, imitation
leather, perrume, incense, an inha¬
lant for treating astnma and ca¬
tarrh, parts of shoes, rayon, lino¬
leum, and a host of chemical prod¬
ucts.
The department of agriculture
maintains a forest products labora¬
tory at the University of wisconsin.
A long list of “forest specialties,”
products of wood, issued by that
laboratory, includes, in addition to
those mentioned: cascara, alcohol,
dyes, balsam, rubber, turpentine,
lime, phonograph records, ropes and
twines, surgical dressings, and
sausage casings.
And not only have research, in¬
genuity, and scientific investigation
given to humanity these many serv¬
ants for its use and pleasure, but
continued investigation is under
way and no doubt the future will
witness even more startling devel¬
opments. A Californian, for exam¬
ple, claims to have discovered a
process whereby he can create silk
from the massive redwood tree. It
is well known that paper is manu¬


"Forest Specialties

Wood---Which, Believe It Or Not, Include
Everything From Catile Food To Glass

factured from wood pulp.
Various extractives come from
trees, such as cedarwood oil, dyes,
quinine, galactan, pinite, sequoyite,
and tannin. The redwood tree pro¬
duces a pulp that often is used to
make paper, but it is also rich in ex¬
tractives. One chemical company
uses the redwoods for making a
perfume, extracting the fragrance
from the extreme tips of very young
trees. From the same tree the com¬
pany makes an inhalant for treat¬
ing asthma, sinus, and other head
affections. A redwood incense also
is made in the form of candles.
Cattle food from wood is a prod¬
uct of sawdust. The treatment con¬
sists of cooking the sawdust under
pressure with dilute sulphuric acid
which converts a portion of the cel¬
lulose and allied substances into
sugar. The resulting liquor, to¬
gether with the washings from the
undigested sawdust residue, is neu¬
tralized with lime and evaporated
to a thick sirup. This is mixed with
the dried residue for feeding. The
meal is dark brown, rather powde¬
ry, and has a slightly sweet, woody
odor and flavor.
Sawdust is used for quite a num¬
ber of purposes besides floor cover¬
ings for butcher shops and packing
material for shipping merchandise.
It is used in the manufacture of gas
for both heating and illuminating.
Sawdust is used, with other wood


ogs being transported to the mills.
It is almost unbelievabia that fram loss,
such as these, san be made rayon, lino¬
leum, nerfume, dynamite, and a host of
other articlas.


substances, for manufacturing pro¬
ducer gas, and illuminating gas may
also be made by distilling the saw¬
dust in retorts similar to those used
for distillation of coal.
In California a big industry has
grown up in the manufacture of in¬
sulation from redwood-bark fiber,
which is particularly adapted to
this purpose since it resists fire. An¬
other strange quality of this bark is
that it will not absorb water or
moisture from the air. Another
queer feature about this bark fiber
is that instead of settling and con¬
tracting, after packing, it is so re¬
silient and springy that it has a
tendency to expand slightly. And
the chlorophyll that destroys the
germs in the bark, prevents rot.
Wood flour is wood products
ground to an extreme fineness, six¬
ty per cent of it being made from
sawdust and shavings. At least
three-fourths of that made in the
United States comes from white
pine. More than half the wood flour
made in the United States enters
into the manufacture of linoleum,
where it is used chiefly as a filler.
With nitroglycerin and other ingre¬
dients, wood flour is also used to
make dynamite. It is also used as a
filler, with phenol resins, to be
molded into various articles, such as
radio dials, handles of all kinds, tele¬
phone parts, automobile radiator
caps, and ignition blocks.
The conversion of wood or its cel¬
lulose into sugar is mainly for the
manufacture of ethyl alcohol.
Europe is now making sugar from
wood extensively. Germany has it
almost on a commercial basis and a
Swedish professor estimates it
should be possible to extract from
Swedish forests not less than
1,000,000 tons of wood sugar.
One of the most interesting uses
of wood has been in the manufac¬
ture of safety glass. The form of
glass in which wood is used consists
of two thin sheets of plate glass,
with a plastic made from a wood
product in between, fastened to¬
gcther with an adhesive. At first
the plastic was made from cellulose
nitrate, which is from cotton. Now
it is made from cellulose acetate,
which is from wood pulp.
Rayon, formerly called artificial
silk, is another of the forest’s gifts
to humanity. It is simply a multi¬
filament textile fiber, the product

of plant cellulose, either from cot¬
ton or wood pulp, mainly the latter.
In manufacturing rayon a high¬
grade pulp must be used and all im¬
purities removed by dissolving the
cellulose. The solution then is
forced through minute apertures
corresponding to the spinnerets of
the silkworm. It emerges as fine
threads or filaments, which are
coagulated either in a fixing bath
or by evaporation, several of them

formed simultaneously being twist¬
ed into the strand or yarn for spin¬
ning. Finally it goes through che¬
mical processes to give it the luster
of silk.
The art of staining the wood of
living trees by inserting dyes into
their stumps or roots has been
practised for many years, but now
it has been developed until patents
have been issued in America and
Canada on the process and dyes
used. There is said to be a wide
market for such stained wood, espe¬
cially where ordinary surface¬
staine 1 wood is exposed to continu¬
ous wear. Also, many colored no¬
velties are produced from pieces left
in cutting out bigger articles.
The forest products laboratory
has even conducted experiments in
de-inking old newspapers by a
washing process that reduces them
to pulp, using a clay found in Wyo¬
ming to carry off the carbon. One
ton of pulp can be recovered from
2,500 pounds of old newspapers. In
Chicago, alone, it is stated, 325 tons
of waste newspapers can be collect-
ed daily and converted into about
260 tons of de-inked pulp. This
would mean a daily saving of 300
cords of wood and annually would
equal the cut on 4,000 acres of 100-
year-old spruce-fir forest.

the activities of underworld charac-
ters have lately annoyed peaceful
citizens of the town.
Recently, a bunch of gangsters


victimized a wealthy physician of
Baliuag, running away with pre¬
cious jewels and money said to
amount to a considerable sum.
However, it was not the robbery
that surprised many so much as the
inefficient way in which the local
police tried to effect the crooks’ ar¬
rest. The gangsters escaped suc¬
cessfully. Up to the time of writing
their whereabouts have not been as¬
certained.
Here in Baliuag, the members of
the police force do not go out to
patrol in dark and questionable
places. This laxity of the local rep¬
resentatives of the law encourages
evil-minded people to do their worst,
as happened in the case of the
aforementioned robbery. Nor was
that case a single instance of its


kind in the province of Bulacan.
Another such robbery was perpet¬
rated in Quingua some time ago.
If the tide of criminality which
seems to be mounting high in this
province is to be suppressed at all,
there ought to be a rigid enforce¬
ment of the law, particularly in the
towns of Baliuag and Quingua. For
the safety of the inhabitants, the

Quezon or Osmena?
Gentlemen:


In the event that the H-H-C act
is ultimately accepted (if amend-
ments of the objectionable provi¬
sions of that law are effected), the
next thing to consider will be this:
Who, by right, should be elected
first Filipino governor-general of
the country? Should it be Quezon
or Osmena?
By virtue of his present position
as leader of the Filipino people, Que¬
zon should be given preference over
any other leader worthy of becom-
ing governor-general. He has the
abilities that make for a strong
leader.
However, there is this thing to
consider. After having fought
against the acceptance of the H-H-C
act, and after having called it worth-
less and vigorously attacked it and
finally succeeded in having the leg¬
islature reject it, should he (Que¬
zon) be placed at the head of the
government which will operate
under the provisions of the very law
he deliberately opposed? It would
seem absurd if not totally unthink¬
able to place Quezon at the helm of
our government-to-be. Unless, of
course, he could rightly claim that
he was responsible for any proper
amendments of the law.

L ARRABIATA
(The Fury)
By PAUL HEYSE


—HE day had scarcely dawned.
Over Vesuvius hung one
broad gray stripe of mist,
I
stretching across as far as
Naples, and darkening all the small
towns along the coast. The sea lay
calm. Along the shore of the nar
row creek that lies beneath the Sor¬
rento cliffs, fishermen and their
wives were at work already, some
with giant cables drawing their
boats to land, with the nets that
had been cast the night before, while
others were rigging their craft,
trimming the sails, or fetching out
oars and masts from the great
grated vaults that have been built
deep into the rocks for shelter to
the tackle overnight. Nowhere an
idle hand; even the very aged, who
had long given up going to sea, fell
into the long chain of those who
were hauling in the nets. Here
ar! there, on some flat housetop,
an old woman stood and spun, or
busied herself about her grand-


children, whom their mother had
left to help her husband.
“Do you see, Rachela? yonder is
our padre curato," said one to a
little thing of ten, who brandished
a small spindle by her side; "Anto¬
nio is to row him over to Capri.
Madre Santissima! but the rever¬
end signore’s eyes are dull with
sleep!” and she waved her hand to
a benevolent-looking little priest,
who was setting himself in the boat,
and spreading out upon the bench
his carefully tucked-up skirts.
The men upon the quay had drop-
ped their work to see their pastor
off, who bowed and nodded kindly,
right and left.
"What for must he go to Capri,
granny?” asked the child. “Have
the people there no priest of their
own, that they must borrow ours?”
“Silly thing!” returned the gran¬
ny. "Priests they have in plenty-
and the most beautiful of churches
and a hermit too, which is more


than we have. But there lives a
great signora, who once lived here;
she was so very ill! Many’s the
time our padre had to go and take
the Most Holy to her, when they
thought she could not live the
night. But with the Blessed
Virgin’s help she got strong
and well, and was able to bathe
every day in the sea. When she
went away, she left a fine heap
of ducats behind her for our church,
and for the poor; and she woulo
not go, they say, until our padre
promised to go and see her over
there, that she might confess to him
as before. It is quite wonderful,
the store she lays by him! Indeed
and we have cause to bless ourselves
for having a curato who has gifts
enough for an archbishop, and is
in such request with all the great
folks. The Madonna be with him!”
she cried, and waved her hand
again, as the boat was about to put
from shore.
“Are we to have fair weather, my
son?” inquired the little priest
with an anxious look toward Naples.
“The sun is not yet up,” the
young man answered; “when he
comes, he will easily do for that
small trifle of mist."
“Off with you, then! that we may
arrive before the heat."
Antonio was just reaching for
his long oar to shove away the boat,
when suddenly he paused, and fixed
his eyes upon the summit of the
steep path that leads down from
Sorrento to the water. A tall and
slender girlish figure had become
visible upon the heights, and was
now hastily stepping down the
stones, waving her handkerchief.
She had a small bundle under her
arm, and her dress was mean and
poor. Yet she had a distinguished
if somewhat savage way of throw¬
ing back her head, and the dark
trees wreathed round it was like a
diadem.
"what have we to wait for?" in-
quired the curato.
“There is someone coming who
wants to go to Capri—with your
permission, padre. We shall not go
a whit the slower. It is a slight
young thing, but just eighteen."
And that moment the young girl
appeared from behind the wall that
bounds the winding path.
“Laurella!” cried the priest. "And
what has she to do in Capri?”
Antonio shrugged his shoulders.
She came up with hasty steps, her


eyes fixed straight before her.
"Ha! PArrabiata! good-morning!”
shouted one or two of the young
boatmen. But for the curato’s pre¬
sence, they might have added more;
the look of mute defiance with
which the young girl received their
welcome appeared to tempt the more
mischievous among them.
“Good-day, Laurella!" now said
the priest. “How are you? Are
you coming with us to Capri?”
“If I may, padre.”
“Ask Antonio there; the boat is
his. Every man is master of his
own, I say, as God is master of us
all."
“There is half a carlino, if I may
go for that?” said Laurella, with-
out looking at the young boatman.
“You need it more than I,” he
muttered, and pushed aside some
orange-baskets to make room: he
was to sell the oranges in Capri,
which little isle of rocks has never
been able to grow enough for all its
visitors.
“I do not choose to go for noth-
ing," said the girl, with a slight
frown of her dark eyebrows.
“Come, child," said the priest;
“he is a good lad, and had rather
not enrich himself with that little
morsel of your poverty. Come now
and step in," and he stretched his
hand to help her, "and sit you down
by me. See, now, he has spread
his jacket for you, that you may sit
the softer. Young folks are all
alike; for one little maiden of
eighteen they will do more than for
ten of us reverend fathers. Nay,
no excuse, Tonino. It is the Lord’s
own doing, that like and like should
hold together
Meantime Laurella had stepped
in, and seated herself beside the pa¬
dre, first putting away Antonio’s
jacket without a word. The young
fellow let it lie, and, muttering be¬
tween his teeth, he gave one vigor¬
ous push against the pier, and the
little boat flew out into the open
bay.
“What are you carrying there in
that little bundle?” inquired the
padre, as they were floating on over
a calm sea, now just beginning to
be lighted up with the early rays of
the rising sun.
"Silk, thread, and a loaf, padre.
The silk is to be sold at Anacapri
to a woman who makes ribbons, and
the thread to another."
“Spun by yourself?”
“Yes, sir.”

“You once learned to weave rib¬
bons yourself, if I remember
right?”
“I did, sir; but mother has been
much worse, and I cannot stay so
long from home; and a loom to our¬
selves we are not right enough to
buy.”
“Worse, is she? Ah! dear, dear!
when I was with you last, at Easter,
she was up."
“The spring is always her worst
time. Ever since those last great
storms, and the earthquakes she has
been forced to keep her bed from
pain."
"Pray, my child. Never slacken
your prayers and petitions that the
Blessed Virgin may intercede for
you; and be industrious and good,
that your prayers may find a hear¬
ing."
After a pause: “When you were
coming toward the shore, I heard
them calling after you, 'Good-morn¬
ing, PArrabiata!' they said. What
made them call you so? It is not a
nice name for a young Christian
maiden, who should be meek and
mild."
The young girl’s brown face
glowed all over, while her eyes
flashed fire.
“They always mock me so, because
I do not dance and sing, and stand
about to chatter, as other girls do.
I might be left in peace, I think:
I do them no harm.”
"Nay, but you might be civil. Let
others dance and sing, on whom
this life sits lighter; but a kind
word now and then is seemly even
from the most afflicted.”
Her dark eyes fell, and she drew
her eyebrows closer over them, as if
she would have hidden them.
They went on a while in silence.
The sun now stood resplendent
above the mountain chain; only the
tip of Mount Vesuvius towered be¬
yond the groups of clouds that had
gathered about its base; and on the
Sorrento plains the houses were
gleaming white from the dark
green of their orange-gardens.
“Have you heard no more of that
painter, Laurella?” asked the cura¬
tor—“that Neapolitan, who wished
so much to marry you?” She shook
her head. “He came to make a pic¬
ture of you. Why would you not
let him?'
“What did he want it for? There
are handsomer girls than I. Who
knows what he would have done
with it? He might have bewitched
me with it, or hurt my soul, or even
killed me, mother says.”
“Never believe such sinful
things!” said the little curator very
earnestly. "Are not you ever in
God’s keeping, without Whose will
not one hair of your head can fall?
and is one poor mortal with an
image in his hand to prevail against
the Lord? Besides, you might have
seen that he was fond of you; else
why should he want to marry you?”
She said nothing.
“And wherefore did you refuse
him? He was an honest man, they
say, and comely; and he would have


kept you and your mother far bet-
ter than you ever can yourself, for
all your spinning and silk-winding.
“We are so poor!” she said pas¬
sionately; "and mother has been ill
so long, we should have become s
burden to him. And then I never
should have done for a signora.
When his friends came to see him,
he would only have been ashamed
of me.”
“How can you say so? I tell you
the man was good and kind; he


would even have been willing to
settle in Sorrento. It will not be so
easy to find another, sent straight
from heaven to be the saving of
you, as this man, indeed, appeared
to be."
“I want no husband—I never
shall,” she said, very stubbornly,
half to herself.
“Is this a vow? or do you mean
to be a nun?”
She shook her head.
“The people are not so wrong
who call you wilful, although the


name they give you is not kind,
Have you ever considered that yot
stand alone in the world, and that
your perverseness must make your
sick mother’s illness worse to bear,
her life more bitter? And what
sound reason can you have to give
for rejecting an honest hand,
stretched out to help you and your
mother? Answer me, Laurella.”
“I have a reason," she said reluc¬
tantly, and speaking low; “but it is
one I cannot give.”


“Not give! not give to me? not to
your confessor, whom you surely
know to be your friend—or is he
not?”
Laurella nodded.
“Then, child, unburden your
heart. If your reason be a good
one, I shall be the very first to up-
hold you in it. Only you are young,
and know so little of the world. A
time may come when you will find
cause to regret a chance of happi¬
ness thrown away for some foolish
fancy now.”


Shyly she threw a furtive glance
to the other end of the boat, where
the young boatman sat, rowing
fast. His woolen cap was pulled
deep down over his eyes; he was
gazing far across the water, with
averted head, sunk, as it appeared,
in his own meditations.
The priest observed her look, and
bent his ear down closer.
“You did not know my father?”
she whispered, while a dark look
gathered in her eyes.
“Your father, child! Why, your
father died when you were ten
years old. What can your father
(Heaven rest his soul in paradise!)
have to do with this present perver¬
sity of yours?”
“You did not know him, padre;
you did not know that mother’s ill-
ness was caused by him alone.”
"And how?”
“By his ill-treatment of her; he
beat her and trampled upon her. I
well remember the nights when he
came home in his fits of frenzy. She
never said a word, and did every¬
thing he bade her. Yet he would
beat her so, my heart felt ready to
break. I used to cover up my head
and pretend to be asleep, but I cried
all night. And then, when he saw
her lying on the floor, quite sudden¬
ly he would change, and lift her up
and kiss her till she screamed and
said he smothered her. Mother
forbade me ever to say a word of
this; but it wore her out. And in
all these long years since father
died, she has never been able to get
well again. And if she should soon
die—which God forbid!—I know
who it was that killed her.”
The little curato’s head wagged
slowly to and fro; he seemed uncer¬
tain how far to acquiesce in the
young girl’s reasons. At length he
said: “Forgive him, as your moth-
er has forgiven! And turn your
thoughts from such distressing pic-
tures, Laurella; there may be bet-
ter days in store for you, which will
make you forget the past,
"Never shall I forget that!” she
said, and shuddered. "And you
must know, padre, it is the reason
why I have resolved to remain un¬
married. I never will be subject to
a man, who may beat and then
caress me. Were a man now to
want to beat or kiss me, I could
defend myself; but mother could
not—neither from his blows nor
kisses—because she loved him. Now,
I will never so love a man as to be
made ill and wretched by him.
“You are but a child, and you
talk like one who knows nothing at
all of life. Are all men like that
poor father of yours? Do all ill¬
treat their wives, and give vent to
every whim and gust of passion?
Have you never seen a good man
yet? or know good wives, who live
in peace and harmony with their
husbands?
“But nobody ever knew how fa¬
ther was to mother; she would have
died sooner than complain or tell of
him, and all because she loved him.

Who Is Who In The


Y N the new insular auditor of the
Philippine government, one will
A not now recognize the ranch
hand and the truck driver of many
years ago. Only thirty-seven years
old to-day, J. Weldon Jones has had
a life as crowded as any man of his
age, or even men far older than
himself, could wish. As a boy, he
tended cattle and horses in his
father’s ranch in Texas, and as a
young enlisted man, he drove army
trucks for the American Expedi¬
tionary Force over the war-battered
areas of France. Later,
after he had married he
was an enterprising part¬
ner in some business ven¬
tures, and auditor of cer¬
tain corporations, and still
later, professor of account¬
ing in Ohio.
To J. Weldon Jones, the
new insular auditor, "life
should be measured in terms
of experiences.” He said:
"A job, no matter how in¬
consequent, should not be
looked upon with utter dis¬
favor or disregard. Every
little experience counts in
life, and there will always
be a time when one will
need one or all of such ex¬
periences."
The new insular auditor,
perhaps the youngest to be
appointed to that position,
was born in Farmersville,
Texas, on February 28,
1896. He is the son of A.
B. Jones and Lula Yeary,
both American residents of
Farmersville, a small com¬
munity populated mainly by
cotton growers. While J.
Weldon Jones was still a
small boy, the family moved
to a ranch in the same state
which was sixteen miles
from the nearest railroad.
The elder Jones is a rancher
and used to own a big graz¬
ing territory in the heart of
the wide plains of Texas.
As the family had settled in a very
rough and new country, the Joneses
were forced to live in a dug-out.
It was in that dug-out that J.
Weldon Jones had his first edu¬
cation. His father, who was "good
in mathematics," and his mother
were his first private tutors. The
aptitude of his father for mathe¬
matics seemed to have been trans¬
ferred to the son, for as we shall
see later, J. Weldon Jones excelled
in that line.
Having obtained enough grammar
school education from his private tu¬
tors, J. Weldon Jones found no dif¬
ficulty in being admitted into the
Quanah High School of Quanah,
Texas. He graduated in 1914 and
entered the Baylor University of
Waco, Texas, where he obtained his
A. B. degree in 1918. Mr. Jones did


not actually complete the four-year
course in that college, as he was in
his senior year when he enlisted for
the army and sailed for France.
While in France, his sheepskin was
mailed to him by the Baylor Uni¬
versity, his ratings for the early
part of the school year being highly
satisfactory. He was in France for
fifteen months, but being merely a
driver of delivery trucks, he did not
experience any actual fighting, al¬
though he was in the front lines
most of the time.


J. Weldon Jones


Insular Auditor
With the Armistice proclamation,
J. Weldon Jones returned to Texas
and resumed his interrupted studies.
He enrolled in the University of
Texas, and obtained his M. B. A.
degree in 1922. Soon after his
graduation, he became partner of
the firm F. G. Masquelette & Co.,
with headquarters in Houston. In
1927, he became resident auditor of
the American Republics Corporation
and professor of accounting, audit¬
ing, and income tax procedure in the
Ohio St-te University. At this
same university, Mr. Jones complet-
ed his work for the Ph. D. degree
(while teaching), and would have
been conferred the honors were he
not sent to the Philippines to as¬
sume the important position of in¬
sular auditor. The only requirement
he has not completed so far is “dis¬


sertation.” Finance was his major
subject in the university.
The appointment of Mr. Jones
as insular auditor was a surprise to
him and to the members of the
faculty of the Ohio State Univer¬
sity. He was notified of his un¬
expected appointment on November
4, 1933, and left Columbus, Ohio,
for Washington, D. C., on November
11.
While auditor of the American
Republics Corporation, he met Miss
Eth Lynn Camden. He married her
on August 19, 1925, in
Houston, Texas. The
Joneses have one child,
Martha Ruth, 6.
Golfing and raising
horses and cattle are the
hobbies of the new insular
auditor. Since his arrival
here, he has engaged him¬
self seriously in the study of
Spanish.
Mr. Jones is a member of
the American Institute of
Accountants, and a Certi¬
fied Public Accountant for
the states of Ohio and
Texas.
Speaking of his ideal and
of his attitude towards life
and work, Mr. Jones said:
“If one loses himself in his
work, strange as it may
sound, in it he finds him-
self.” Further, he declared:
“If ene thinks that work
has for its aim the common
good, it seems to me that
the individual may well for¬
get almost all else, and so
forgetting self, perhaps best
realize his innate possibili¬
ties. To me, that thought
has been the most interest.
ing paradox in all my ex¬
periences."
In assuming his office
Mr. Jones said: “There are
no magic governmental rev¬
enues and expenditures.
The tax fund is merely the
fund which the citizens poo
for their common needs and wants.
Every peso spent from that fund
should measure a peso of service. I
see no reason why every disburse¬
ment from the common fund should
not receive as much scrutiny—even
more—as any individual citizen
would give a personal disbursement.
Let me repeat that we are not of
the executive branch of the govern¬
ment but my present conception of
the bureau of audits leads me to
believe that we can be of greatest
assistance to the chief executive in
his efforts to keep the government’s
own 'business on a sound and or¬
derly basis—giving a peso in actual
service for every peso of income.”'

TEACHINGS
Dean Jorge Bocobo defines the
difference between a father and
a mother thus: “When the son
leaves for foreign lands or leaves
the parental roof, the father coun¬
sels him, ‘Make good.' The mo¬
ther, on the other hand, tells her
son, 'Be good."


CHIEFS
Claro M. Recto and Jose P.
Laurel are province-mates, but
not very good friends. The other
day the two met outside of the
sala of Judge Concepcion.
As Laurel ambled out of the
room, he came face to face with
Sen. Recto. “Hello, chief,” he
greeted. His political rival smil¬
ed and returned the greeting. But
Laurel was evidently not anxious
to hear the answer. He had re¬
turned to the sala to fetch his
envelop of briefs, but when he
came out, he found Recto still
waiting for him. As he made fon
the stairs in a hurry, Recto cross¬
ed his way, tapped him on the
shoulder, and said, “Que hay,
chief."
Laurel halted and asked, "What
do you mean by 'chief'? I under¬
stand you are the chief now."


RESPITE
Cavite’s Rep. Emiliano Tria Ti¬
rona and his wife entered the
Savoy theater the other . night
and seated themselves near the
front row. A newspaper reporter
who happened to be around greet¬
ed the couple, asked the solon why
he had selected a seat toc near the
stage, where it strains the eyes
to see the pictures. “I have al¬
ready seen this picture (Jennie
Gerhardt) so I do not need to
strain my eyes,” he answered.
Surprised, the newspaper man
asked him why and what he came
for.
"For a change,” he whispered,
and waited for the vaudeville
show.

customs cop, was a happy man last
week, was officially commended by
Customsman Aldanese for his active
work in connection with the recent
seizure of 1,700 tins of first class
onium worth approximately P17,000.
Poppy was found in a valise with
initials of T. H. Williams. Chinese
passenger who brought the valise
made good his get-away before the
discovery of the contraband had
been made.

If this be love—if love can close our
lips when they should cry out for
help—if it is to make us suffer
without resistance, worse than ever
our worst enemy could make us suf¬
fer—then, I say, I never will be
fond of mortal man."
“I tell you you are childish; you
know not what you are saying.
When your time comes, you are not
likely to be consulted whether you
choose to fall in love or not.” After
a pause, he added, "And that paint-
er: did you think he could have been
cruel?
He made those eyes I have seen
my father make, when he begged
my mother’s pardon and took her
in his arms to make it up. I know
those eyes. A man may make such
eyes, and yet find it in his heart to
beat a wife who never did a thing
to vex him! It made my flesh creep
to see those eyes again."
After this she would not say an¬
other word. The curato also re¬
mained silent. He bethought him¬
self of more than one wise saying,
wherewith the maiden might have
been admonished; but he refrained,
in consideration of the young boat¬
man who had been growing rather
restless toward the close of this
confession.
When, after two hours’ rowing,
they reached the little bay of Capri,
Antonio took the padre in his arms,
and carried him through the last
few ripples of shallow water, to set
him reverently down upon his legs
on dry land. But Laurella did not
wait for him to wade back and fetch
her. Gathering up her little petti¬
coat, holding in one hand her wood¬
en shoes and in the other her little
bundle, with one splashing step or
two she had reached the shore. "
have some time to stay at Capri,"
said the priest. “You need not
wait—I may not perhaps return be¬
fore to-morrow. When you get
home, Laurella, remember me to
your mother: I will come and see
her within the week. You mean to
go back before it gets dark?”
"If I find an opportunity," an¬
swered the girl, turning all her at¬
tention to her skirts.
“I must return, you know,” said
Antonio, in a tone which he believed
to be one of great indifference. “I
shall wait here till the Ave Maria.
If you should not come, it is the
same to me."
“You must come,” interposed the
little priest; "you never can leave
your mother all alone at night. Is
it far you have to go?”
“To a vineyard by Anacapri.”
“And I to Capri. So now God
bless you, child—and you, my son."
Laurella kissed his hand, and let
one farewell drop, for the padre and
Antonio to divide between them.
Antonio, however, appropriated no
part of it to himself; he pulled off
his cap exclusively to the padre,
without even looking at Laurella.
But after they had turned their


ADVENTURER-ACTOR


By RAFAEL A. BAUTISTA


EIFTEEN years ago, when the
government finally decided to
A dissolve the Philippine Nation¬
al Guards after the Armistice was
proclaimed, hundreds of Filipinos
who belonged to that organization
went abroad to "see the world in
Uncle Sam’s ships.” Most of them
were young men, thirsting for


thrills and


ad¬


ventures on the


rough seas.


One of those


a dv entu r¬
ous young men
was Antonic

to help Amer¬
ica "save the world for democracy.
He had not finished the interme
diate course when the naval au¬
thorities at Cavite drafted him for
active service.


Not long after that, the young
bluejacket was transferred to the
Pacific fleet, with station at San
Diego, California. For almost ten
years, Antonio served as a plain
‘gob.” After completing his third
term, he sought retirement and was
given an honorable discharge. But
finding no better job on land, he
enlisted again to become one of
those who man Uncle Sam’s rum¬
runners off the coast of Maine.
It was while handling this tough


job of running down smugglers that
Antonio experienced real fighting.
He was assigned to take charge of
a three-inch gun in the boat. And
that gun still bears marks of having
been fully utilized by “the browr
boy" as many times as there were
suspicious schooners resisting ar¬
rest.
But life out at sea began to get
too monotonous for Antonio. Be¬
sides, he had had enough thrills and
adventures over the rough billows
of the Pacific and Atlantic. So he
finally decided to return to land.
The latest news reaching this
town is that he has landed a job as
a “Chinese” extra in a Hollywood
studio. Studio executives have
changed his name to Tony Lee
And, they say, Tony does not intend
to return home yet.


SERVANT OF GOD
By JOSE G. GIMENO
Y whole lifetime is dedi¬
(e
cated to the service of
I
Christ.” Thus fervently
talked a young, promising priest
He is Rev. Father Vicente Sillorar,
who, at twenty-eight, is tentatively
occupying a conspicuous position in
Guimbal, Iloilo, as a parish priest.
Like many other faithful servants
of Christ, he responded to the call
of priesthood, disregarding various
professional callings. He has
chosen to be a priest not to improve
the economic status of his family
and establish fame and honor for
himself, but to give spiritual guid-
ance to people.
About ten years ago, he entered
the seminary. He was then in his

early teens, but his youth did not
in any way deter his ambitions.
With zeal, he studied persistently
and diligently. He underwent
severe tests and trials during stud¬
ent life, but none of them dampened
his enthusiasm.
In the seminary, they were
taught how to speak and write La¬
tin, Spanish, and English, but the
most emphasis was laid on Latin.
His ten years of studies were clim¬
axed a few months ago. With so¬
lemn ceremonies he was made a
true servant of Christ. Subsequent-
ly, he said his “Misa De Gracia" in
Santa Barbara, Iloilo, his home
town. Prior to the ceremonies, he
pledged before the bishop to exer¬
cise his mission faithfully and to
observe the rules of the Catholic
Church strictly.
To-day, he is temporarily occupy¬
ing the position vacated by Rev.
Father Navarrete, who is now con¬
fined in a hospital. He goes to re¬
mote barrios, irrespective of dist¬
ance and time, when called upon for
confession. He is also a good
preacher.
His career, it is predicted by
many, will be a successful one.

QUESTION:—Are professionals
such as civil engineers, doctors,
and pharmacists, allowed to prac¬
tise their respective professions
without taking examinations in
the Philippines?—Vicente Canete,
Rom. 90-A-A. Bonifacio Street, Ce¬
bu, Cebu.
ANSWER:—(1) Civil Engineers:
No. A certificate without exam¬
ination may be issued by the sec-
retary of public works and com
munications only to a holdier of a
diploma or a certificate showing
him to have completed the study of
civil engineering prior to Februa
ry 23, 1921 (the date en which Act
No. 2985 went into effect) in an
established university, academy
college, school, or institute subse¬
quently recognized as such by the
government of the Philippine Is¬
lands or of the United States or
which cannot be so recognized be¬
cause of its having dropped the
civil engineering course from its
curriculum. (2) Physicians anc
Pharmacists:—Medical and phar¬
macy graduates of foreign schools
have to submit to examinations
given by the boards of examiners
before they can practise their pro¬
fessions in the Philippine Islands.

for Ladislao Yap, chief examiner,
bureau of civil service, Manila.


QUESTIONS: — What is the
price of one complete set of But¬
terick Paris Fashion for the year
1934. postpaid? Also please advise
me if the set could be ordered by
C. O. D.—Leoncia Guevara, Cuya¬
po, Nueva Ecija.
ANSWERS:—A fashion book
comes out every season (in a tem¬
perate country)—Winter, Summer,
Spring, and Autumn. Each book
costs forty-five centavos (P0.45)
postpaid. Orders may be placed
with the Phi'ippine Education
Company, 101 Escolta, Manila. No
C. O. D. orders are filled.—Home
and Fashion Editor.
QUESTIONS:—How much will
the maximum school expenses of a
student intending to take up the
two-year course in the school of
forestry amount to? If a student
completes the two-year course, will
he be allowed to take up the four¬
year course leading to the bachelor
of science in forestry degree? Is
there any entrance or competitive
test for admission? What are the
back subjects to be taken if a stu¬
dent is a graduate of a certain
agricultural school? When does
the regular enrollment in this
school take place?—Miguel E. de
Asis. Lumbatan Agricultural
School, Lumbatan, Lanao.


ANSWERS:—The matriculation
fees for a new student enrolling in
the school of forestry amount to
about P55.00, including deposits.
The average expenses for board,
laundry, and other incidentals will
amount to about P20.00 per month
Students are allowed to take the
straight four-year course leading
to the bachelor of science in fores¬
try degree provided they are not
dropped for poor scholarship.
An entrance examination to de¬
termine the fitness of prospective
students to take up forestry work
is given on the third Monday of
May every year. Those who quali¬
fy in this test become eligible for
admission in the school of fores¬
try. Graduates of agricultural high
schools of the Munoz type whe
have not had high school algebra
and geometry will not be admitted
in the school of forestry. Regis¬
tration of new students takes place
during the week immediately fol¬
lowing the entrance test. It is
probable that beginning June,
1934, only the four-year course
will be offered. —Answered by
Arthur F. Fischer, dean and pro¬
fessor of tropical forest, school of
forestry, Los Banos, Laguna.

ANSWERS: — Pneumonia is a
disease usually associated with
the presence in the lungs of a cer¬
tain germ known as pneumococcus,
Individuals who are exposed much
to hardship and cold are particu¬
larly liable to the disease. The
germs are spread chiefly through
the droplets of saliva and sputum
which are sprayed from the mouth
and nose during sneezing, cough¬
ing, and talking. To avoid infec¬
tion, therefore, healthy individuals
should avoid being near or in close
contact with those suffering from
the disease. Sputum and saliva
should be collected in paper boxes
or napkins and burned. Once a
person is suspected of suffering
from pneumonia, a physician should
be consulted at once.—Answered
by Dr. Hipolito Gatchalian, chief
house physician and surgeon, Chi¬
nese General Hospital, Manila.


QUESTION: — I am a young
man, aged twenty-two. My face is
covered with irritating pimples. I
have resorted to various medicines,
but they gave me no relief. Wili
you tell me how to cure myself?
A. B., Manila.
ANSWER:—Correct hygiene is
of importance in the cure of pim¬
ples. This embraces regular hours
of eating and sleeping, a proper
amount of rest and exercise, proper
bowel activity, and a plain but nu¬
tritious diet. A medicine which
seems to be of value is the so-call¬
ed Fowlers’ solution. Take five
drops three times a day, after
meals, by mouth. The use of vac-
cines by injections can be recom¬
mended also. As for local applica¬
tion, the least the pimples are ma¬
nipulated, the better; at most, only
washing of the face with good
soap and warm water once or twice
a day.—Answered by Dr. Hipolito
Gatchalian, chief house physician
and surgeon, Chinese General Hos¬
pital, Manila.


QUESTIONS:—Sickness in the
nose is quite rampant in our town.
Some say that it’s caused by in¬
dulging in too much kissing. Is
this concept true? Ladies are
mostly the ones having this kind
of sickness. Why? Will you please
inform me the names of the ail-
ments found in the nose and the
symptoms of each disease? What
is the cure for chronic rhinitis?-
Agatoclia Miranda, Cantilan, Su¬
rigao.
ANSWERS: — Cold is spread
from person to person by the dis¬
charges of the nose. Kissing is an
effective way of spreading cold.
There are a number of diseases of
the nose, but it needis medical
knowledge to understand them
Vaccine treatment under the sup¬
ervision of a competent physician
is good for chronic rhinitis.—An¬
swered by Dr. Jose P Bantug,
chief, section on public health edu¬
cation and publicity, bureau of
health, Manila.

THE HATDEN CHILDREN
On this page are shown studio photographs of the thres
Hayden children. People who knew them "when they were just
this high” the last time that they were here about three years
ago could hardly recognize them when they arrived on Decem-
ber 23, 1933 for they have become very tall. The girls are as
tall as their father and have blossomed out into two good¬
looking young women, with poise and charm all their own.
Elizabeth, leff, who is the oldest, is only around fourteen
and a senior in the high school, but she hes already read a lot,
hence the glasses that make her look matfure and scholarly. She
is a bright girl and has always been an honor sfudent.
Mary, below, takes after her father in looks, and is even
taller than Elizabath, She is moody, one time bubbling with
leughter end good humor, the next, very quief and unfathom-
able.
Joseph Ralston Hayden, Jr. Ibelow lefr: a long name
for a small felicw, is called simply Sonny by the family and
friends. He takes full advantage of his position of being the
only boy and the youngest in the femily, but he is not spoiled, for
nobody pets him, although everybody loves him.

HAYDENS
As Told By Dr Maria Lanzar¬
Carpio, Who Knows Them,
Especially Mrs. Hayden And
The Children, Very Well

of the
Governor-General Hayden; second row, right to left: Di
aria Lanzar-Carpio and
Mrs. Hayden; extreme left, third row: Vicente Villamin. "
These persens formed
bart of E
ilippine Round Table
roup at the Institute of Polities, held in the
sachusetts. Dr. Lanzar-Carpio especiulized
129, at Williamstown, M.
summer
n political science at the University of Michigan, and Professor Hayden was her
advisar.


THE HAYDENS are charming
but Mrs. Hayden is somewhat
aloof. This was the impres¬
sion that we carried with us after
our brief interview with the wife
of the new vice governor-general at
the Hilton Carson residence, which
the Haydens are temporarily occupy¬
ing while they are looking for a
house of their own. Mrs. Hayden an¬
swered our questions graciously but
briefly and to the point, not adding
anything that might suggest to us
our next question. Her brief an¬
swers did not encourage the asking
of questions that would give us
glimpses of the Haydens’ family life
at Ann Arbor, or of their likes and
dislikes. So we went away not
knowing more than what had al¬
ready been said about them. How¬
ever, remembering that Mrs. Car¬
pio, the former Dr. Maria Lanzar,
knows them intimately—while she
was a Barbour Scholar at Michigan
University Professor Hayden was
her adviser when she took her doc-
tor’s degree in political science—we
dropped in at her house and con¬
fided our difficulty to her.
“You are not the first person to
say that,” Mrs. Carpio remarked.


"People generally mistake Mrs.
Hayden’s reticence, her quietness,
her dislike to talk about herself or
of her family, for aloofness, some
even for haughtiness. But you will
not think so when you come to know
her more. She is really a very
charming person, highly cultured
and intelligent, but she is very quiet
and self-effacing.”
Mrs. Hayden was the former Miss
Elizabeth Hall, daughter of Dr
Louis P. Hall, professor in the
school of dentistry in the University
of Michigan. He is now retired, be¬
ing more than sixty years of age.
The Halls are very prominent in so¬
cial and religious circles in Ann Ar¬
bor, Mrs. Carpio said. Mrs. Hayden
was sent to a finishing school in
Boston, but instead of becoming a
socialite when she returned home
she enrolled in the University of
Michigan, specializing in English
and Literature. However, she did
not graduate, for in her senior year
she married Professor Hayden, who
had enlisted when the United States
entered the World War.
Mrs. Hayden, according to Mrs.
Carpio, is a happy combination of


the old-fashioned and the modern.
She is old-fashioned in the sense
that she prefers to stay at home,
keeping house, taking care of the
children, and helping her husband
in his work. Mrs. Ilayden cooks,
does much of the housework, and
sews, too, when she has the time
She is the right hand of her hus¬
band, for she clips and files all art-
icles in the newspapers and maga¬
zines that are of interest to him,
goes over his writings, copy- ano
proofreading them, and acting as his
secretary in a general way. On the
other hand, Mrs. Hayden is modern
in the sense that she is well-inform¬
ed on all topies, including those of
political science, which is her hus¬
band’s specialty, but most espe¬
cially in literature. She is profi¬
cient in many games and outdoor
sports, which ability seems to be
necessary now if one does not
want to be a bore in the society of
other people. She plays a good
game of bridge, golf, and tennis.
She can also swim, ride on horse¬
back, and drive an automobile as
well as her husband can. The
Haydens have a country home
where they spend their summers
indulging in the sports that they
love. They always go together
whenever it is possible—for in¬
stance when the trip docs not in¬
terfere with the studies of the
children. This is perhaps the
main reason why Mrs. Hayden
learned those sports: so she can
play with her husband as well as
her children.
The two daughters, the older of
whom is only around fourteen
years of age, have that ease of
manner that is so seldom seen in
girls who are passing through the
adolescent period. For instance,
while the writer was waiting for
Mrs. Hayden in the verandah of
their temporary residence, one of
the girls came up, greeted the
writer easily, and said, "Are yot
waiting for mother? Pll tell her
that you are here.” The other,
who came out to the verandah
later, seeing the writer sitting on
a bench, pointed to an armchair
and said, "Would you not rather
have this chair? It is more com-


fortable.”
Both girls are only in the high
school but they have already read
a lot of books, and are as well-in¬
formed as their parents are, Mrs.
Carpio said. This is due to the fact
that the Haydens have a very fine
and extensive library in their
home at Ann Arbor to which the
children have free access. Then
also their parents used to read to
them when they were small to
make them sleep, and they have
the beautiful custom of reading to
each other in the evenings. Mrs.
Carpio narrated this amusing in¬
cident: Mrs. Carpio went to visit
Elizabeth one day while she was
confined in bed. On the way, she
stopped at a book store and bought
a book, Peter Pan, that she thought
would interest Elizabeth because
it had plenty of pictures and is a
book appropriate for children.
Imagine her surprise when, upon
arriving in the house, she found
the eight-vear-old Elizabeth read¬
ing a book for a grown-up—what
it was Mrs. Carpio now cannot re¬
call, but she thinks it was a novel.
She told Elizabeth that she could
have the fairy book exchanged,
but Elizabeth, child that she was,
said she would keep the book be¬
cause it had so many pretty pic¬
tures and liked it very much al¬
though she had read it many
times already.
The children will continue their
studies here, the girls possibly in a
private school. The last time they
were here they went to the Brent
School in Baguio.
This is Vice Governor-General
Hayden’s fourth trip to the Philip-
pines, Mrs. Hayden’s third, and the
children’s second, so the country,
its climate, and its people are not
new to them. Mrs. Hayden while
here before used to accompa¬
ny her husband on his trips up
north and down south, so she is
more travelled in the country than
many of us natives. During their
previous sojourns here, they lived
in hotels; this time, they are go¬
ing to get a house.

House Plan No. 16
Designed By Antonio C. Kayanan
For Mr. Sixto Farol
Cebu, Cebu


Y TORIZONTALISM — now so
much exploited in most of
II qe latest modernistie erca¬
tions, whether in architectural,
fashion, or car construction—can
also be adopted in our local timber
structures as is evidenced in the
treatment of the house designed
for Mr. Sixto Farol of Cebu.
The site is situated beside a
creek which is dry during the
greater part of the year. The pro¬
posed building is intended to com¬
fortably lodge a rather big family
of nine children, four boys and
five girls, so that a fairly large
house is needed.
An inviting porch, 5.6 meters by
2.6 meters, with wide eaves, occu¬
pies the right portion of the house
frontage. A front porch running
the whole width of the house
would seem more tempting, but a
wide porch in this particular case
is not only clumsy, but also expen¬
sive, impractical, and ugly. Hori¬
zontalism—an architectural treat¬
ment dominated by a series of re¬
lated and co-ordinated horizontal
lines in their simplest form—is
the keynote in the design of the
porch. The beauty of such treat¬
ment is achieved effectively by
adopted proportions not by orna¬
mentation, which, in this case, has
been avoided for reasons both of
economy and good taste. To sin¬
gle out the house from the ordina¬
ry type, the designer even ven¬
tured on a very individualistic de¬


tail: two intermediate sills, substi¬
tuted in place of the usual balus¬
trade work running all round the
porch. This lends to the structure
a novel touch, pleasing to the eyes
and practically inexpensive.
The ceiling of the porch is three
meters above the tiled floor. An
L-shaped stairway of concrete and
earthfill leads to the porch. It will
be noted that horizontal lines have
also been utilized in the style of
the stairs.
Two sliding glass doors separate
the porch from the living room.
while an arch serves as the en¬
trance from the living room to the
dining room. This arch has been
treated in the same modernistic
motif as the porch’s in order to
keep that unique simplicity so
frank and so arrestingly attrac-
tive. The book-shelves of the arch


—

PIILII DF IKEI
   E


are merely S-shaped, open and un¬
ornamented. The columns are
without capitals and the tradition¬
al pedestals.
There are three bedrooms, two
of which are bigger than the third,
which is located in front. The two
big rooms are for the children. All
the doors that lead to these bed¬
rooms are .9 meter by 2 meters
and panelled to match the horizon¬
tal scheme of the building.
The kitchen is separated from
the dining room by a pair of swing-
ing bar doors, made of wood louv¬


ers. A service porch connects with
the kitchen at the rear.
The windows are 1.8 meters high
each and are equipped with sliding
sashes of frosted glass panes cut
to harmonize with the adopted
horizontal details. Even the ba¬
lustrade below the windows are of
horizontal pieces subtly arranged
to maintain consistent charm.
The main ceiling is 3.7 meters
above the floor, this being 2 me¬
ters above the ground level. Pa¬
nelled lattice work serves as walls

Worth-While Trying Out


Are The Following Menus That
Feature Three Well-Known
Dishes, Done
Differently


Menu No. 1
Broiled Sweetbreads with Squash Souffle
Green Vegetable Salad
Chocolate Cream Dessert
Tea or coffee
It is necessary to let the sweetbreads stand
in cold (preferably iced) water for an hour or
so. Then boil in the salted water for about twen¬
ty minutes, plunging them into cold water as
soon as you take them out to keep them firm.
Trim all the membrane and lay the sweetbreads
aside while you prepare the rest of the dinner,
for it will take just a few minutes to split them
crosswise and broil them over charcoals. They
must be served immediately, with slices of lemon
and with Squash Souffle.
Cut a medium-sized squash into two and
boil after removing seeds and membrane. When
tender remove from the fire, scoop out the meat,
mash and measure to make 118 cups. Make a
thick white sauce by melting 4 tablespoons of
butter in the top of a double boiler or in a small
saucepan placed in a bigger one with boiling wa¬
ter, adding 4 tablespoons of flour slowly, and
when the two are well-blended, nouring in 11g
cups of milk. Let cook until thick. Add the
slightly beaten yolks of 3 eggs and add the squash
which has been seasoned with salt and pepper.
Mix well and fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites.
Steam until firm. If you have an oven, you may
brown the sonffle in it. Serve immediately as
the sonffle literally settles down when it becomes
cool.
The chocolate cream dessert is a new version
of the well-known custard or leche flan. Melt
one squere or 3 tablespoons of cocoa in 1 table¬
spoon of boiling water. Add 2 cupfuls of con¬
densed milk and one teaspoon of vanilla flavoring.
Pour into a mold and steam until set. Cover
with a meringue made from the whites of eggs,
beaten stiff and sweetened with a little sugar.
Serve cold.
Menu No. 2
Hungariin Chicken with Rice
Tomato Coleslaw
Ginger Sherbet
The Hungarian Chicken with Rice is another
version of Chicken a la King. To make it, stew
at a low temperature a young chicken, cut into
four parts, for about 114 hours or until tender.
Make a cream sauce in a double boiler, using 1
cupful of chicken stock, 1 tablespoon of flour, 1
cupful of evaporated milk. Add to this the con¬
tents of a small can of tomato sauce and cook
the whole thing for 20 minutes. Place the chic-
ken in the center of a large platter and make a
border of rice, molded in cups, around the chic-
ken. Pour the cream sauce over the chicken and
the rice. Garnish with thin slices of green pep-
per.
The tomato coleslaw is made this way:
Shred finely one small head of cabbage, cut three


tomatoes in dice, and chill, if possible. Combine
2 tablespoons of flour, 2 tablespoons of sugar,
1 teaspoon mustard, salt, and a few grains of
cayenne. Add to slightly beaten 2 egg yolks. Add
34 cup of evaporated milk and 2 tablespoons of
butter. Cook over hot water for about three
minutes and then add 3 tablespoons of vinegar
slowly. Cook, stirring constantly, until slightly
thick. When ready to serve, combine the cabbage,
tomatoes, and the dressing.
For the ginger sherbet, boil a picce of
crushed ginger in water, remove from the fire,
and add to it about 1 cupful of orange juice.
Sweeten to taste, strain, and pack in ice and salt
for several hours. If desired, the ginger may be
simply iced, as tea, and then served in tall
glasses.
Menu No. 3
Lamb Cutlets a la Monaco
Green Pea Sauce
Autumn Salad
Tapioca Pudding
Tea or Coffee


Cut the lamb meat into thin, small pieces;
saute for five minutes, remove from the pan,
and bread thoroughly with seasoned crumbs. Re¬
turn to the pan and fry slowly until brown. Open
a small can of peas and bring the contents to a
boil. Strain and pour over them a sauce made
by mixing together 2 tablespoons of melted but¬
ter, some capers, if available, and a little vine¬
gar. If desired, the peas may be mashed, sea¬
soned, and served as sauce for the cutlets.
The salad consists of 14 cupful of diced tart
apples, L cupful of chopped pineapple, M cupful
of chopped nut meats, and 14 cupiul of seedless
raisins. Moisten with a little mayonnaise or
orange juice. Serve on salad greens and garnish
with sections of cranges, rolled in sugar.
The tapioca pudding is made by cooking Va
cupful of tapioca in 4 cupfuls of water and a
little salt in the top of a double boiler, until
transparent. Quarter 6 apples and core, that is,
remove the center and the seeds. Boil in 1 cup-
ful of sugar and a little spice. Mix with the ta¬
pioca and cook in the double boiler for about half
an hour, until thick. Serve hot.
—o0o—


Na matter how simple the food may be, if it is served atfractively it will arousa interest and appetite. More¬
over, it is good training in table munners for the children to sit dewn at a well-appainted and correctly set table,
and to sat as if there wers company.

HOMEWARD


By DOMINADOR V MONDRAGON
THE day’s light is fading.
And now,
I hear in the silence
The call of my Father,
Who waits at the doorway
For His child’s return.
The long night is near,
And I must go
Homeward.

backs, he let his eyes travel but a
short way with the padre, as he
went toiling over the deep bed of
small, loose stones; he soon sent
them after the maiden, who, turn
ing to the right, had begun to climb
the heights, holding one hand above
her eyes to protect them from the
scorching sun. Just before the path
disappeared behind high walls, she
stopped, as if to gather breath, and
looked behind her. At her feet lay
the marina; the rugged rocks rose
high around her; the sea was shin¬
ing in the rarest of its deep-blue
splendor. The scene was surely
worth a moment’s pause. But, as
chance would have it, her eyes, in
glancing past Antonio’s boat, met
Antonio’s own, which had been fol¬
lowing her as she climbed.
Each made a slight movement, as
persons do who would excuse them¬
selves for some mistake; and then,
with her darkest look, the maiden
went her way.
Hardly one hour had passed since
noon, and yet for the last two An¬
tonio had been sitting waiting on
the bench before the fishers' ta¬
vern. He must have been very
much preoccupied with something,
for he jumped up every moment to
step out into the sunshine, and look
carefully up and down the roads,
which, parting right and left, led to
the only two little towns upon the
island. He did not altogether trust
the weather, he then said to the hos-
tess of the osteria; to be sure, it
was clear enough, but he did not
quite like that tint of sea and sky.
Just so it had looked, he said, before
the last awful storm, when the
English family had been so nearly
lost; surely she must rememeber it?
No, indeed, she said, she didn’t,
Well, if the weather should hap-
pen to change before night, she was
to think of him, he said.
“Have you many fine folks over
there?” she asked him, after a
while.
“They are only just beginning;
as yet, the season has been bad


enough; those who come to bathe,
came late."
“The spring came late. Have you
not been earning more than we at
Capri?”
‘Not enough to give me macaroni
twice a week, if I had had nothing
but the boat—only a letter now and
then to take to Naples, or a gentle¬
man to row out into the open sea,
that he might fish. But you know
I have an uncle who is rich; he owns
more than one fine orange-garden;
and, 'Tonino, says he to me, 'while I
live you shall not suffer want; and
when I am gone you will find that
I have taken care of you.' And so,
with God’s help, I got through the
winter."
“Has he children, this uncle who
is rich?'
“No, he never married; he was
long in foreign parts, and many a
good piastre he has laid together
He is going to set up a great fish¬
ing business, and set me over it, to
see the rights of it."
“Why, then you are a made man,
Tonino!”
The young boatman shrugged his
shoulders. “Every man has his
own burden, said he, starting up
again to have another look at the
weather, turning his eyes right and
left, altho he must have known that
there can be no weather side by
one.
“Let me fetch you another bot¬
tle,” said the hostess; "your uncle
can well afford to pay for it."
"Not more than one glass; it is a
fiery wine you have in Capri, and
my head is hot already."
“It does not heat the blood; you
may drink as much of it as you
like. And here is my husband
coming; so you must sit a while,
and talk to him.
And in fact, with his nets over
his shoulder, and his red cap upon
his curly head, down came the
comely padrone of the osteria. He
had been taking a dish of fish to
that great lady, to set before the
little curato. As soon as he caught
sight of the young boatman, he be¬
gan waving him a most cordial wel¬


come; and he came to sit beside him
on the bench, chattering and ask¬
ing questions. Just as his wife was
bringing her second bottle of pure
unadulterated Capri, they heard the
crisp and crunch, and Laurella was
seen approaching from the left-
hand road to Anacapri. She nodded
slightly in salutation; then stopped,
and hesitated.
Antonio sprang from his seat. "
must go,” he said. "It is a young
Sorrento girl, who came over with
the signor curato in the morning.
She has to get back to her sick
mother before night."
“Well, well, time enough yet be¬
fore night," observed the fisher¬
man; "time enough to take a glass
of wine. Wife, I say, another glass!”
“I thank you; I had rather not".
and Laurella kept her distance.
"Fill the glasses, wife; fill them
both, I say; she only wants a little
pressing.
"Don't,” interposed the lad. "It
is a wilful head of her own she has;
a saint could not persuade her to
do what she does not choose." And
taking a hasty leave, he ran down
to the boat, loosened the rope, and
stood waiting for Laurella. Again
she bent her head to the hostess,
and slowly approached the water
with lingering steps. She looked
around on every side, as if in hopes
of seeing some other passenger. But
the marina was deserted. The fish
ermen were asleep, or rowing about
the coast with rods or nets; a few
women and children sat before their
doors, spinning or sleeping; and
strangers as had come over in the
morning were waiting for the cool
of the evening. She had not time
to look about her long; before she
could prevent him, Antonio had
seized her in his arms and carried


her to the boat, as if she had been
an infant. He leaped in after her.
and with a stroke or two of his oar
they were in deep water.
She had seated herself at the end
of the boat, half turning her back
to him, so that he could only see her
orofile. She wore a sterner look
than ever: the low, straight brow
was shaded by her hair; the round-
ed lips were firmly closed; only the
delicate nostril occasionally gave a
wilful quiver. After they had gone
a while in silence, she began to feel
the scorching of the sun; and, un¬
loosening her bundle, she threw the
handkerchief over her head, and be¬
gan to make her dinner of the
bread; for in Capri she had eaten
nothing.
Antonio did not stand this long;
he fetched out a couple of the
oranges with which the baskets had
been filled in the morning. “Here
is something to eat to your bread,
Laurella," he said. "Don’t think I
kept them for you; they had rolled
out of the basket, and I only found
them when I brought the baskets
back to the boat.”
“Eat them yourself; bread is
enough for me."
“They are refreshing in this
heat, and you have had to walk so
far.”
“They gave me a drink of water,
and that refreshed me."
“As you please,” he said, and let
hem drop into the basket.
Silence again. The sea was
smooth as glass. Not a ripple was
heard against the prow. Even the
white sea-birds that roost among
the caves of Capri pursued their
prey with soundless flight.
“You might take the oranges to
your mother," again commenced

“We have oranges at home; and

buy some more.”
“Nay, take these to her, and give
hem to her with my compliments."
“She does not know you.”
“You can tell her who I am.”
“I do not know you either.”
It was not the first time that she
had denied him thus. One Sunday
of last year, when that painter had
first come to Sorrento, Antonio
had chanced to be playing boccia
with some other young fellows in
the little piazza by the chief street.
There, for the first time, had the
painter caught sight of Laurella,
who, with her pitcher on her head,
had passed by without taking any
notice of him. The Neapolitan,
struck by her appearance, stood still
and gazed after her, not heeding
that he was standing in the very
midst of the game, which, with two
steps, he might have cleared. A
very ungentle ball came knocking
against his shins, as a reminder
that this was not the spot to choose
for meditation. He looked round, as
if in expectation of some excuse
But the young boatman who had
thrown the ball stood silent among
his friends, in such an attitude of
defiance that the stranger had
found it more advisable to go his
ways and avoid discussion. Still,
this little encounter had been spok¬
en of, particularly at the time wher
the painter had been pressing his
suit to Laurella. “I do not even
know him," she said indignantly,
when the painter asked her whether
it was for the sake of that uncour¬
teous lad she now refused him. But
she had heard that piece of gossip,
and known Antonio well enough
when she had met him since.
And now they sat together in this
boat, like two most deadly enemies,
while their hearts were beating fit
to kill them. Antonio’s usually so
good-humored face was heated to
scarlet; he struck the oars so sharp-
ly that the foam flew over to where
Laurella sat, while his lips moved
as if muttering angry words. She
pretended not to notice, wearing
her most unconscious look, bending
over the edge of the boat, and let-
ting the cool water pass between
her fingers. Then she threw off her
handkerchief again, and began to
smooth her hair, as though she had
been alonc. Only her eyebrows
twitched, and she held up her wet
hands in vain attempts to cool her
burning cheeks.
Now they were well out in the
open sea. The island was far be¬
hind, and the coast before them lay
yet distant in the hot haze. Not a
sail was within sight, far or near—
not even a passing gull to break the
stillness. Antonio looked all round,
evidently ripening some hasty reso
iution. The color faded suddenly
from his cheek, and he dropped his
oars. Laurella looked round invo¬
luntarily—fearless, yet attentive.

Ghastly souvenirs of the

The authorities entrusted with the destruction of such unwanted souvenirs

“I must make an end of this,”
the young fellow burst forth. "It
has lasted too long already! I only
wonder that it has not killed me!
You say you do not know me? And
all this time you must have seen me
pass you like a madman, my whole
heart full of what I had to tell you;
and then you only made your cros¬
sest mouth, and turned your back
upon me.”
"What had I to say to you?” she
curtly replied. “I may have seen
that you were inclined to meddle
with me, but I do not choose to be
on people’s wicked tongues for
nothing. I do not mean to have
you for a husband—neither you nor
any other.”

painter. Bah, you were but a child!
You will feel lonely enough yet,

change my mind. What is that to
you?”

boat leaped and danced. "What is
it to me, you say? You know well
enough! I tell you, that man shall
perish miserably to whom you shall
prove kinder than you have been
to me!”
“And to you, what did I ever
promise? Am I to blame if you be
mad? What right have you to me?”
Ah! I know,” he cried, "my right
is written nowhere. It has not
been put in Latin by any lawyer,
nor stamped with any seal. But
this I feel: I have just the right to
you that I have to heaven, if I die
an honest Christian. Do you think
I could look on and see you go to
church with another man, and see
the girls go by and shrug their
shoulders at me?”
“You can do as you please. I am
not going to let myself be frighten¬
ed by all those threats. I also mean
to do as I please."
"You shall not say so long!" and
his whole frame shook with pas¬
sion. “I am not the man to let my
whole life be spoiled by a stubborn
wench like you! You are in my po¬
wer here, remember, and may be
made to do my bidding."
She could not repress a start, but
her eyes flashed bravely on him.
“You may kill me if you dare,” she
said slowly.
“I do nothing by halves,” he said,
and his voice sounded choked and
hoarse. “There is room for us both
in the sea. I cannot help thee,
child”—he spoke the last words
dreamily, almost pitifully—“but we
must both go down together—both
at once—and now!” he shouted, and
snatched her in his arms. But at
the same moment he drew back his
right hand; the blood gushed out;
she had bitten him fiercely.
“Ha! can I be made to do your
bidding?” she cried, and thrust him


from her, with one sudden move¬
ment. "Am I here in your power?
and she leaped into the sea and
sank.
She rose again directly; her
scanty skirts clung close; her long
hair, loosened by the waves, hung
about her neck. She struck out va¬
liantly, and, without uttering a
sound, she began to swim steadily
from the boat toward the shore.
With senses benumbed by sudden
terror, he stood, with outstretched
neck, looking after her, his eyes
fixed as tho they had just been
witness to a miracle. Then giving
himself a shake, he seized his oars,
and began rowing after her with all
the strength he had, while all the
time the bettom of the boat was
reddening with the blood that kept
streaming from his hand.
Rapidly as she swam, he was at
her side in a moment. "For the love
of our most Holy Virgin,” he cried,
“get into the boat! I have been a
madman! God alone can tell what
so suddenly darkened my brain. It
came upon me like a flash of light¬
ning and set me all on fire. I knew
not what I did or said. I do not
even ask you to forgive me, Laurel¬


la, only to come into the boat again
and not to risk your life!
She swam as tho she had not
heard him.
“You can never swim to land. I
tell you it is two miles off. Think
of your mother! If you should come
to grief, I should die of horror.”
She measured the distance with
her eye, and then, without answer¬
ing him one word, she swam up to
the boat, and laid her hands upon
the edge; he rose to help her in.
As the boat tilted over to one side
with the girl’s weight, his jacket
that was lying on the bench slipped
into the water. Agile as she was,
she wung herself on board without
assistance, and gained her former
seat. As soon as he saw that she
was safe, he took to his oars again,
while she began quietly wringing
out her dripping clothes, and shak¬
ing the water from her hair. As
her eyes fell upon the bottom of the
boat, and saw the blood, she gave a
quick look at the hand, which held
the oar as if it had been unhurt.
“Take this,” she said, and held
out her handkerchief. He shook his
head, and went on rowing. After
a time she rose, and, stepping up to


him, bound the handkerchief firmly
round the wound, which was very
deep. Then, hecdless of his endeav¬
ors to prevent her, she took an oar,
and, seating herself opposite him,
began to row with steady stroke,
keeping her eyes from looking to¬
ward him—fixed upon the oar that
was scarlet with his blood. Both
were pale and silent. As they drew
near land, such fishermen as they
met began shouting after Antonio
and gibing at Laurella; but neither
of them moved an eyelid, or spoke
one word.
The sun stood yet high over Pro¬
cida when they landed at the mari
na. Laurella shook out her petti¬
coat, now nearly dry, and jumped
on shore. The old spinning woman
who in the morning had seen them
start, was still upon her terrace.
She called down, "What is that upon
your hand, Tonino? Jesus Christ!
the boat is full of blood!"
“It is nothing, comare," the young
fellow replied. “I tore my hand
against a nail that was sticking out
too far; it will be well to-morrow.
It is only this confounded ready
blood of mine, that always makes a
thing worse than it is.”
“Let me come and bind it up, com¬
parello. Stop one moment; I will
go and fetch the herbs, and come to
you directly.”
“Never trouble yourself, comare.
It has been dressed already; to-mor-
row morning it will be all over and
forgotten. I have a healthy skin,
that heals directly.”
“Addio!" said Laurella, turning
to the path that goes winding up the
cliffs. “Good-night!” he answered,
without looking at her; and then
taking his oars and baskets from
the boat, and climbing up the small
stone stairs, he went into his own
hut.
He was alone in his two little
rooms, and began to pace them up
and down. Cooler than upon the
dead calm sea, the breeze blew fresh
through the small unglazed win¬
dows, which could only be closed
with wooden shutters. The solitude
was soothing to him. He stooped
before the little image of the Vir¬
gin, devoutly gazing upon the glory
round the head (made of stars cut
out in silver paper). But he did
not want to pray. What reason had
he to pray, now that he had lost all

he had ever hoped for?
And this day appeared to last
forever. He did so long for night!
for he was weary, and more exhaust-
ed by the loss of blood than he
would have cared to own. His hand
was very sore. Seating himself upon
a little stool, he untied the hand¬
kerchief that bound it; the blood,
so long repressed, gushed out again;
all round the wound the hand was
swollen high.
He washed it carefully, cooling it
in the water; then he clearly saw
the marks of Laurella’s teeth.
“She was right,” he said; "I was
a brute, and deserved no better. I
will send her back the handkerchief
by Giuseppe to-morrow. Never
shall she set eyes on me again."
And he washed the handkerchief
with the greatest care, and spread
it out in the sun to dry.
And having bound up his hand
again, as well as he could manage
with his teeth and his left hand, he
threw himself upon his bed, and
closed his eyes.
He was soon waked up from a
sort of slumber by the rays of the
bright moonlight, and also by the
pain of his hand; he had just risen
for more cold water to sooth its
throbbing, when he heard the sound
of someone at the door. Laurella
stood before him.
She came in without a question
took off the handkerchief she had
tied over her head, and placed her
little basket upon the table; then
she drew a deep breath.

“You are come to fetch your
handkerchief," he said. "You need
not have taken that trouble. In the
morning I would have asked Giusep¬
pe to take it to you."
“It is not the handkerchief," she
said quickly. “I have been up among
the hills to gather herbs to stop the
blood; see here.” And she lifted the
lid of her little basket.
“Too much trouble,” he said, not
in bitterness—“far too much trou¬
ble. I am better, much better; but
if I were worse, it would be more
than I deserve. Why did you come
at such a time? If any one should
see you? You know how they talk,
even when they don’t know what
they are saying."
“I care for no one’s talk,” she
said, passionately. “I came to see
your hand, and put the herbs upon
it; you cannot do it with your left."
“It is not worth while, I tell you.”
“Let me see it then, if I am to be¬
lieve you.
She took his hand, that was not
able to prevent her, and unbound
the linen. When she saw the swel¬
ling, she shuddered, and gave a
cry: “Jesus Maria!”
“It is a little swollen," he said;
“it will be over in four-and-twenty
hours."
She shook her head. “It will cer¬
tainly be a week before you can go
to sea."
“More likely a day or two; and if
not, what matters?”
She had fetched a basin, and be¬
gan carefully washing out the
wound, which he suffered passively,
like a child. She then laid on the
healing leaves, which at once reliev¬
ed the burning pain, and finally
bound it up with the linen she had
brought with her.
When it was done: "I thank you,"
he said. "And now, if you would do
me one more kindness, forgive the


madness that came over me; forget
all I said and did. I cannot tell how
it came to pass; certainly it was
not your fault—not yours. And
never shall you hear from me again
one word to vex you."
She interrupted him. “It is I who
have to beg your pardon. I should
have spoken differently. I might
have explained it better, and not
enraged you with my sullen ways.
And now that bite—
“It was in self-defense; it was
high time to bring me to my senses.
As I said before, it is nothing at all
to signify. Do not talk of being
forgiven; you only did me good, and
I thank you for it. And now, here
is your handkerchief; take it with
you.”
He held it to her, but yet she lin¬
gered, hesitated, and appeared to
have some inward struggle. At
length she said: “You have lost
your jacket, and by my fault; and I
know that all the money for the
oranges was in it. I did not think
of this till afterward. I cannot re¬
place it now; we have not so much
at home—or if we had, it would be
mother’s. But this I have—this sil-
ver cross. That painter left it on
the table the day he came for the
last time. I have never looked at it
all this while, and do not care to
keep it in my box; if you were to
sell it? It must be worth a few
piastres, mother says. It might
make up the money you have lost;
and if not quite, I could earn the
rest by spinning at night when
mother is asleep.”
"Nothing will make me take it,"
he said shortly, pushing away the
bright new cross which she had tak¬
en from her pocket.
“You must,” she said; “how can
you tell how long your hand may
keep you from your work? There
it lies; and nothing can make me so


much as look at it again."
“Drop it in the sea, then."
“It is no present I want to make
you; it is no more than is your due;
it is only fair.”
“Nothing from you can be due to
me; and hereafter when we chance
to meet, if you would do me a kind¬
ness, I beg you not to look my way.
It would make me feel you were
thinking of what I have done. And
now good-night; and let this be the
last word said."
She laid the handkerchief in the
basket, and also the cross, and
closed the lid. But when he looked
into her face, he started. Great
heavy drops were rolling down her
checks; she let them flow unheeded.
“Maria Santissima!” he cried.
“Are you ill? You are trembling
from head to foot!”
“It is nothing,” she said; "I must
go home”; and with unsteady steps
she was moving to the door, when
suddenly she leaned her brow
against the wall, and gave way to a
fit of bitter sobbing. Before he
could go to her she turned upon him
suddenly, and fell upon his neck.
“I cannot bear it!" she cried
clinging to him as a dying thing to
life—“I cannot bear it! I cannot
let you speak so kindly, and bid me
go, with all this on my conscience.
Beat me! trample on me! curse me!
Or if it can be that you love me
still, after all I have done to yon,
take me and keep me, and do with
me as you please; only do not send
me away so!” She could say no
more for sobbing.
Speechless, he held her a while
in his arms. “If I can love you
still!" he cried at last. "Holy
Mother of God! Do you think that
all my best heart’s blood has gone
from me through that little wound?
Don’t you hear it hammering now,
as though it would burst my breast
and go to you? But if you say this
to try me, or because you pity me,
I can forget it. You are not to
think you owe me this, because you
know what I have suffered for
you.”
"No!" she said very resolutely,
looking up from his shoulder into
his face, with her tearful eyes; "it
is because I love you; and let me
tell you, it was because I always
feared to love you that I was so
cross. I will be so different now. I
never could bear again to pass you

be seen in the above picture, the bad fellows are lined up on an elevated
platform while every possible means of identifying them are employed by
the authorities. In the picture, the chairman of the sub-committee investi¬

no man but her husband."
She kissed him thrice, and, es¬
caping from his arms: "And now
good-night, amor mio, cara vita
mia!” she said. "Lie down to sleep,
and let your hand get well. Do not
come with me; I am afraid of no
man, save of you alone.”
And so she slipped out, and soon
disappeared in the shadow of the
wall.
He remained standing by the
window, gazing far out over the
calm sea, while all the stars in heav¬

The next time the little curato sat
in his confessional, he sat smiling to
himself. Laurella had just risen
from her knees after a very long
confession.
“Who would have thought it?” he
said musingly — “that the Lord
would so soon have taken pity upon
the wayward little heart? And I
had been reproaching myself for not
having adjured more sternly that ill
demon of perversity. Our eyes are
but shortsighted to see the ways of
Heaven! Well, may God bless her,
I say, and let me live to go to sea
with Laurella’s eldest born rowing
me in his father’s place! Ah! well,
indeed! PArrabiata!”

however, are made of sidings, lo¬
cally known as Rizal boards.
The roof has been made a little
flat in order that it may harmonize
with the general layout of the
building and at the same time save
the owner much in the amount of
galvanized iron sheets.
The building contains about
151.5 square meters of floor area
and will cost from P4.500 to P5,000
to finish, depending upon the cur¬
rent price of local materials and
labor.
The plan may be altered to suit
the tastes of the owner, especially
the location of the bath and toilet.
In this plan, these are placed at
the rear of the building, with ac¬
cess through the kitchen, at the
request of the client in order to
save as much floor space as pos¬
sible. Placing the bath and toilet
near the bedrooms would mean
more convenience and privacy, but
floor space would have to be taken
from the bedrooms, thus reducing
them in size.

Federico Mangahas, “Christmas

were all deserving of attention. But
I think that the best personal es¬
says of 1933 are “The Pleasures of
a Perambulating Mind" and "Stir¬

A. Lansang, and appeared for the
first time in Dear Devices.
It seems to me, also, that we have
made strides in the realm of satire.
Knickerknocker Van Loon’s "Mani¬

LOVERS

DEATH is a lover strong and dark;
Life is a lover, too—majestic, fair;
Death’s cold and passionless,
Life’s warm and passionate.
When Death and Life wooed me,
Death promised peace—Life, warmth.
I clutched at Life—rejected Death.
But Life proved false, its beauteous face—
A mask that hid the serpent soul...
And now I weep and wail and long

to speak of; and the little that I
saw of 1933’s couple of Filipino no¬
velettes did not encourage further
investigation.
Now, then, as to the other of the
two things I mentioned in the be¬
ginning: myself. I have many rea¬
sons to be grateful for 1933, and if
I am not less happy in 1934 and in
the other years to come, I shall have
no cause to complain. This is to
say that I hope, among other
things, to continue holding old
friends and making new ones.


 BANTAY'S SADDLE INDUSTRY
Continued from page 16
although there are thousands of
miles of highways and good roads
and thousands of motor vehicles in
the country to-day, the horse is still
a common means of transportation,
especially in mountainous, hilly, or
sandy places. In these parts the
horse has a decided advantage over
the motor car. The saddle industry
is therefore not in the doldrums—
yet. Bantay’s industry can be
'saved” if the saddlers start mak¬
ing their products of the best quali¬
ty and sell them at the lowest price


possible. Now, this is not saying
that Bantay saddles are inferior and
costly. They are good and cheap
at the same time. But there is still
some room for improvement.

A Dozen Hints On Discipline
By SERAFIN LIBRODO
(Principal Estancia Elementary School, Itoilo)


Y know of many teachers who have
failed in teaching. Their failures
Ican casily be traced to poor
discipline. At the end of the year,
they were either asked to resign due
to inefficiency or tendered their
resignation voluntarily because they
were conscious of the poor work
they performed. Some of them
might have had good stocks of
ideas, but because of poor discipline,
turned out 'know nothing’ pupils.
For of what value are beautiful
thoughts of the teacher who can
not transmit them to his students?
Good discipline is an essential me¬
dium of instruction. With it the
teacher can insure the flow of
knowledge from his head to those
of his pupils. Below are twelve
hints which may help new and pros-
pective teachers maintain desired
discipline.
1. Mastery of the subject matter.
A teacher should establish faith
among his pupils that he knows
his subject. Students have high
regard, respect, and admiration for
the teacher who masters his subject.
I still respect the memory of my
dead high school teacher who could
recite in chronological order import¬
ant events in American history.
You cannot help but admire as I do,
a teacher of mine in high school who
could recite from memory at least
three of every famous American
and English poet.
2. Firmness. He must be firm
in his decision. When he suspends
a pupil, he sees to it that he is
suspended.


3. Alertness. He must be alert.
He must be able to see the activities
of the pupils in the room.
4. Judiciousness. He is wise. He
is tolerant but unyielding once he
has made up his mind.
5. Humaneness. He feels as his
pupils do. He shares with the wor¬
ries of the poor parents who are
struggling hard to keep their child-
ren in school.
6. Exemplary conduct. He prac¬
tices the fundamental health habits.
He does what he preaches in school.
7. Hard work. He is a pain¬
staking, hard working fellow. He
has ready and sufficient materials
and devices for teaching.
8. Persuasive speech. He talks
with the correct stress and rhythm.
The voice is well modulated. He
pronounces his words clearly and
distinctly.
9. Tact. He enforces rules strict¬
ly, yet he is loved. He gets the full
cooperation of those who are under
him and those working with him.
10. Cheerfulness. Everyday is a
sunny day to him.
11. System. He observes the
daily routine in his class system¬
atically, resulting in efficiency.
12. Accuracy, neatness, and ef¬
ficiency. He sees to it that pupils
do their work accurately, neatly,
and in less time
I believe that observance of the
above twelve hints will help new
teachers establish discipline. Dis¬
cipline and teaching are one. Teach
well and you get good discipline.

PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIA¬
TION ORGANIZED
A parent-teacher association was
organized recently in San Narciso,
Tayabas, among the aims of which
are: to foster friendly understand¬
ing between parents of school chil-
dren and teachers and to help solve
school problems. The desire of the
parents to form such an association
was manifested by the presence of
many parents from all walks of life
when the first meeting was held.
The following officers were
elected: Principal Teacher Mr. Ani¬
ceto Resuma, president; former
Municipal President Mr. Pelagio
Fontanilla, vice president; Teacher
Mr. Apolinar Jovellana, secretary;
Municipal Treasurer Mr. Lucio Bi¬
tong, treasurer; Judge Marciano
Aquino, representative; and Sanita¬
ry Inspector Mr. Victorio Dator,
reporter.


MAGAZINES FOR SCHOOL
LIBRARIES
This Office (Bureau of Educa¬
tion, Manila) will be glad to assist
in finding sources for obtaining
back numbers of magazines to com¬
plete library files. It is suggested,
in this connection, that school li¬
brarians before the end of each
school year forward to this Office
lists of back numbers of magazines
which they need but do not have,
and also lists of extra copies which


they have but do not need. With
each magazine title included in
these lists should be indicated the
volume number and the month and
year of issuance.
Copies of magazines might be
exchanged between schools as need¬
ed, might be sent from one school
to another without charge except
for cost of postage, or might be paid
for on the basis of a nominal charge
made by the schools possessing
them.
To facilitate such service as that
above indicated, it is very essential
that each school carefully preserve
such extra copies of important mag¬
azines as it may have available from
time to time.


MALALAG SCHOOL GARDEN
DAY
The first Garden Day to be held
in Malalag, Davao, was celebrated a
few weeks ago, and proved a success,
thanks to the management of Juan
Fernandez, head teacher, and E.
Cabanilas, teacher, in co-operation
with Angel M. Rama, well-to-do
farmer of the locality. There were
athletic events and other attrac-
tions, including a play, songs, reci¬
tations, a dance, etc. Among the
distinguished guests: Cosme Luna,
supervising teacher; Lieut. and
Mrs. C. Gantuangko; Lieut. J. J.
Jereza; Councilor L. Aradillos; and
others.

Memorandum
No. 76, s. 1933
RESULTS OF THE 1933
CLEAN-UP-WEEK CONTEST
TO ALL PRINCIPALS:
1. The clean-up week from De¬
cember 10 to December 16, 1933,
was observed with great enthusiasm
and zeal on the part of the school
children, classroom teachers, and
principals. It is gratifying to note
the results which have been achiev¬
ed. Four of the schools which were
entered in the final competition
were all so immaculately clean that
it was a physical impossibility to
select the cleanest out of the four.
It was found necessary to resort to
the formation of a special commit-
tee to go over the four school build¬
ings. The special committee, after
thorough and careful deliberation
over the results of its inspection,
submitted the following report:
Magdalena Elementary School
—First Place
Legarda Elementary School
—Second Place
Bonifacio Elementary School
—Third Place
Honorable Mention
School for the Deaf and the Blind
Mapa High School
Zaragoza Elementary School
Jefferson Primary School
2. This office is deeply cognizant
of the splendid co-operation given
by pupils, teachers, and principals
in making observance of the 1933
clean-up week a huge success. To
have a thoroughly clean school build¬
ing is not an end in itself; it is the
social attitudes produced by the ob¬
servance of clean-up week which
should be recognized and which
should go a long way in improving
the home environment of the school
children.
3. The clean-up week prize which
was retained by the Bonifacio Ele¬
mentary School from December,
1932, to December, 1933, should, as
a result of this year’s contest, be
transferred to the Magdalena Ele¬
mentary School on January 2, 1934.

COTABATO
The Mt. Matutum Debating Club,
recently organized by Adolfo Casco¬
lan, principal of the Cotabato Iligh
School, had its election of officers
some time aga and the following
were elected:
President, E. Echavez; vice pres¬
ident, A. Mercado; secretary, V.
Sanchez; treasurer, P. Mercado;
and reporter, A. Biduan.
After the election of officers, the

The Batac Rural High Student
Honor Society was recently organ¬
ized by the members of the faculty
of the school to promote better un¬
derstanding among students. An
inaugural program was held some
time in which prominent people in
the community were invited to ad-
lress the students. Juan Franco,
who was the guest of honor, talked
on the present hard times, its ef¬
fects on business and the part it
played on unemployment.

MANILA
The student writers of the Mani¬
la College of Pharmacy and Dentis¬
try recently formed themselves into
a club called the “Writers' Club."
The society was organized for the
purpose of developing a better crop
of writers to contribute to “The
Pharos,” the official organ of the
school. It is the hope of the mem¬
bers of the club that the school pa¬
per will be as good if not better
than the publications of other
schools.

PAMPANGA
The fifteenth anniversary of the
foundation of the Guagua National
Institute will be celebrated from
January 20 to 21, 1934. To insure
the success of this affair, different
committees were recently formed to
look into the different activities
planned in connection with the an¬
niversary. Judging from prepara¬


tions, this coming celebration of the
school will eclipse all previous ones.
Miss Engracia Laconico, Miss Phil-
ippines for 1933, has kindly consent¬
ed to be present during the celebra¬
tions.

ROMBLON
Recently, the Student Council of
the Romblon High School held its
election of officers with the follow-
ing result: President, Leopoldo S.
Fondevilla; vice president, Cesario
Maaba; treasurer, Guia Gajisan;
secretary, Emma Mayor; sgt.-at¬
arms, Jose Mortel. The student


council has had many activities dur¬
ing the year.

TARLAC
For the first time, the Tarlac
Elementary School observed Boys'
Week this year. The school princi¬
pal, Miss Rufina Reyes, inducted
into office boys from the interme¬
diate grades and some from the
fourth grede. She gave her place to
Paterno Catacutan, Grade VII pu¬
pil. The administration of the boy
officials was a success. It is hoped
that Boys' Week will be observed in
the school every year.

The ost words of Love


NCE upon a time a very
cruel fairy, pretty as the
flowers, but wicked as the
serpents who hide in the
grass ready to spring upon you,
resolved to avenge herself upon all
the people of a great country.
Where was this country? On the
mountain or on the plain, at the
shore of the river or by the sea?
This the story does not tell. Per¬
haps it was near the kingdom where
the dressmakers were very skilful
in adorning princesses’ robes with
moons and with stars. And what was
the offense under which the fairy
smarted? On this point also the
story is silent. Perhaps they had
omitted to offer up prayers to her
at the baptism of the king’s daugh-
ter. Be this as it may, it is certain
that the fairy was in a great rage.
At first she asked herself whe¬
ther she should devastate the coun¬
try by sending out the thousands


of spirits that served her, to set
fire to all the palaces and all the
cottages; or whether she should
turn all the lilacs and all the roses
to fade; or whether she should turn
all the young girls into ugly old
women. She could have let loose all
the four winds in the streets and
laid low all the houses and trees.
At her command fire-spitting moun¬
tains would have buried the entire
land under a mass of burning lava,
and the sun would have turned from
his path so as not to shine upon
the accursed city. But she did still
worse. Like a thief leisurely choos¬
ing the most precious jewels in a
case, she removed from the memory
of men and women the three divine
words: “I love you.”
And having wrought this afflic-
tion, she removed herself with a
smile that would have been more
hideous than the church of the de¬
vil had she not had the most beau¬


By CATULLE MENDES


At first the men and women only
half perceived the wrong that had
been done them. They felt they
lacked something, but did not know
what. The sweethearts who met in
the eglantine lanes, the married
couples who talked confidingly to
each other behind closed windows
and drawn curtains, suddenly inter¬
rupted themselves and looked at
each other or embraced. They felt,
indeed, the desire to utter a certain
customary phrase, but they had no
idea even of what that phrase was.
They were astonished, uneasy, but
they asked no question, for they
knew not what question to ask, so
complete was their forgetfulness of
the precious word. As yet, how-
ever, their suffering was not very
great. They had so many other
words they could whisper to each
other, so many other terms of af-
fection and endearment.
Alas! It was not long before
they were seized with a profound
melancholy. In vain did they adore
cach other, in vain did they call
each other by the tenderest names,
and speak the sweetest language.
It was not enough to declare that all
the bliss lay in their tenderly-ex¬
changed kisses; to swear that they
were ready to die, he for her and
she for him; to call each other:
“My soul! My flame! My dream!!”
They instinctively felt the need of
saying and hearing another word,
more exquisite than all other words;
and with the bitter memory of the
ecstasy contained in this word, came
the anguish of never again being
able to utter or to hear it.
Quarrels followed in the wake of
this distress. Judging his happi¬
ness incomplete on account of the
avowal that was henceforth denied
to the most ardent lips, the lover
demanded from her and she from
him the very thing that neither the
one nor the other could give, with-
out either knowing what that thing
was, nor being able to name it.
They accused each other of cold-
ness, of perfidy, not believing in


the tenderness which was not ex-
pressed as they naturally desired it
should be.
Thus the sweethearts soon ceased
to have their rendezvous in the
lanes where the eglantines grew,
and, even after the windows were
closed, the conjugal chambers
echoed only with dry conversations
from easy-chairs that were never
drawn close to each other. Can
there be joy without love? If the
country which had incurred the ha¬
tred of the fairy had been ruined
by war, or devastated by pestilence,
it could not have been as desolate,
as mournful, as forlorn as it had
become on account of the three for-
gotten words.
There lived in this country a
poet whose plight was even more
pitiful than the plight of all the
rest. It was not that, having a
beautiful sweetheart, he was in
despair at not being able to say and
to hear the stolen word. He had no
sweetheart. He was too much in
love with the Muse. It was because
he was unable to finish a poem he
had begun the day before the wick-
ed fairy had accomplished her ven¬
geance. And why? Because it just
happened that the poem was to
wind up with “I love you!" and it
was impossible to end it in any
other way.
The poet struck his brow, took
his head between his hands, and
asked himself: “Have I gone mad?”
He was certain he had found the
words that were to precede the last
point of exclamation before he had
commenced to write the stanza. The
proof that he had found them was
that the rhyme with which it was
to go was already written. There
it was—it waited for them, hay,
called aloud for them; it wanted no
others, waiting for them like lips
waiting for sister lips to kiss them.
And this indispensable, fatal phrase
he had forgotten; he could not even
recall that he had ever known it.
Surely there was some mystery in
this, the poet mused unceasingly
(Continuad on page 46)


E ATULLE MENDES, say the editors of Great Stories of all
Nations, "was a brilliant poet and one of the moving
Ospirits of the Parnassians... His work has a sensuous
quality, besides being delightfully fantastic."
“The Lost Words of Love,” one of the beautifully fanciful
tales of this French novelist, dramatist, poet, and story-writer,
was included by Konrad Bercovici in his collection of the twenty
best short-stories of the world.

and with bitter melancholy—oh,
the pang of interrupted poems!—
as he sat at the edge of the forest
near the limpid fountains where
the fairies are wont to dance of an
evening by starlight.
Now, as he sat one morning un¬
der the branches of a tree, the
wicked, thieving fairy saw him and
loved him. One is not a fairy for
nothing; a fairy does not stand on
ceremony. Swifter than a butter-
fly kisses a rose she put her lips on
his lips, and the poet, greatly pre¬
occupied though he was with his
ode, could not help but feel the heav-
enliness of her caress. Blue and
rose-diamond grottos opened up in
the depths of the earth, luminous as
the stars. Thither the poet and the
fairy were drawn in a chariot of
gold, by winged steeds who left the
earth in their flight. And for a
long, long time they loved each
other, forgetful of all but their
kisses and smiles. If they but
ceased for a moment to have their
mouths united and to look into
each other’s eyes, it was only to
take pleasure in more amiable di¬
versions. Gnomes dressed in violet
satin, elves attired in a misty haze,
performed dances before them that
fell in rhythm with the music of
unseen orchestras, while flitting
hands that had no arms brought
them ruby baskets of snow-shite
fruit, perfumed like a white rose
and like a virgin bosom. Or, to


'WE DO OUR PART"


please the fairy more, the poet re¬
cited, while striking the chords of
a theorbo, the most beautiful verses
his fancy could conceive.
Fairy that she was, she had nev¬
er known joy incomparable to this
of lheing sung to by a beautiful
young man who invented new songs
every day. And when he grew


Now it is no
longer a question
merely of the fac¬
tories, firms, and
the various rami¬
fications of the in¬
dustrial life of the
United St at es
vhich are helping
President Roose¬
velt in his nation¬
al recovery admi¬
nistration. Bene¬
dicts and spins¬
ters are now “do¬
ing their part'
too. At the left can
be seen the latest
pair to marry un¬
der the NRA ban¬
ner. Asked what
their interpreta¬
tion of the famous
initials was, they
answered: "New
rules annexed.”


silent, and she felt the breath of
his mouth near her, felt it passing
through her hair, she melted away
in tenderness.
Their happiness seemed without
end. Days passed by, many, many
days, but nothing occurred to dis¬


turb their joy. And yet she had
moments of gloom, when she would
sit musing, with her cheek on her
hand and her hair falling in streams
down to her hips.
“O queen!” he cried, "what is it
that makes you sad; what more
can you desire, seeing that we are
so happy in the midst of all our
pleasures, you who are all-powerful,
you who are so beautiful?”
At first she made no answer, but
when he insisted, she sighed and
said: “Alas! one always ends by
suffering the evil that one had in¬
flicted on others. Alas! I am sad
because you have never told me:
‘I love you.””
He did not pronounce the words,
but uttered a cry of joy at having
found again the end of his poem.
In vain the fairy attempted to re-
tain him in the blue and rose-dia¬
mond grottos, in the gardens of lilies
that were as luminous as the stars.
He returned to earth, completed,
wrote and published his ode, in
which the men and the women of
the afflicted country found again
the divine words they had lost.
Now there were rendezvous again
in the lanes, and warm, amorous
conversations at the conjugal win¬
dows.
It is because of poetry that
kisses are sweet, and lovers say
nothing that the poets have not
sung.

KISSING FISHES


Who says that the "art" of osculation is unknown among the fishes?
The New York aquarium has imported Java’s kissing fishes, “Cha and Hot-

blunder in killing the act and if it
fails to secure a better law de¬
serves to go down in ignominy
and be denounced as assassins of
the Philippine independence act."
Osmena On Stump
—E HAT the pros are quite sure
of their ground and are not
I apprehensive of Washington
developments in spite of the pre¬
sence of President Quezon in that
capital is shown by the spirited
march of Osrox Commander Osme¬
na all over his native Cebu, hunting
down antis and shelling anti strong¬
holds.
Explaining to his constituents
the why of the organization of the
Pro Independence Nacionalista Par¬
ty, Osmena said:
“I have always urged unity on
the national cause against ene¬
mies of independence but Senate
President Quezon allied himself
with the opponents of independ¬
ence, hence the break in the Na¬
cionalista party."
Senator Osmena also revealed a
Quezon proposition to scuttle Ro¬
xas, leave the latter to his doom.
Osmena stated that Quezon pro¬
posed to him that Osmena go with
Quezon to the U. S. and leave Ro¬
xas alone. But Osmena is for Ro¬
xas, plans to stick by Roxas:
“We fought together for our
independence. If we fall, we
must fall together. Roxas and
other members of the independ¬
ence mission have fallen but they
fell into the aris of the people.
When Quezon and his followers
fall they will land on a concrete
landing."
"Write It Down"
y HILE no immediate an¬
W nouncement was made of
what transpired at the
White House conference and lunch¬
eon, subsequent communiques gave
the low-down on the Roosevelt-Que¬
zon huddle. Washington reports
thus:
"President Franklin D. Roose¬
velt to-day extended the oppor¬
tunity to Manuel Quezon, presi¬
dent of the Philippine senate,
and his associates on the inde¬
pendence mission, to write their
own program for the solution of
the Philippine problem.
"Without committing hiniself
further, the President assured
Quezon that the mission’s pro¬
grain would receive serious and
open-minded consideration when
it is presented.
“Quezon, elated over the way
in which prospects for early ac¬
tion on independence were bright¬
ening, indicated he hoped to have
a formula ready for submission
within a week.
“Antis” Rejoice
ETARVED for encouraging
breaks for three weeks, the
W antis are, naturally, after the
announcement of the invitation of
the president that the mission put
down on paper what they desire in
the way of independence, whooping


it up, predicting the success of the
Quezon mission. And just as the
pros circulated the news that there
was demoralization in the anti
ranks when communiques were
pouring in from Washington as to
the gloomy future of Mr. Quezon’s
expedition, so are the antis now
telling everybody of the panic that
has hit the pro camp.


At this writing the antis are gath-
ering for conclave, the Quezon mis¬
sion having wired local headquar¬
ters for suggestions.
"Pros” Make Comment
S to be expected, the pros
make little of the Quezon
A cacnicvement” whien con¬
sists of a luncheon and a conference


wherein the U. S. president was no
more than civil to his P. I. subjects.
First to comment, of course, was
Bantam Osias. Said he:
“I am elated that Quezon was
finally compelled to submit a con¬
crete proposition because up to
this hour the Filipino people do
not know what he really wants.
“The fact that it has been bid-
ing its time instead of acting with
dispatch seems to indicate that
the Quezon mission came to Wa¬
shington without a definite plan
or measure to present.
“Qnezon must submit a pro¬
position for distinct improvement
of the Hare-Hawes-Cutting act.
It must be practical and he must
see that it is enacted into law if
he is to atone for the crime of
killing the independence act
Next to fire was Roxas:
“The suggestion inade by Pres¬
ident Roosevelt that the mission
present a plan for the solution of
the Philippine problem is logical.
I am surprised that President
Roosevelt found it necessary to
make this request, for every one
in the Philippines had been made
to believe that the mission and
the new majority had a definite¬
plan... We will at last find ou
what the ideas of Mr. Quezon on
independence are... I sincerely
wish that a frauk discussion
should take place between Pres¬
ident Roosevelt and the mission
and that some positive result be
attained. There is nothing we
will not do to facilitate a just
solution.

MOROS NOW CLAMOR
Continued from page 9



through the untiring efforts of Es¬
peridion Encabo, who has remained
in the district that long, Ramain
to-day has a complete elementary
school. From simple beginnings,
Ramain’s has become as progres¬
sive as any school in an ordinary
town. One who visits this district
will not know, unless he has been
told beforehand, that the pupils are
Moros. They dress as Christian
children do, and act the way edu¬
cated people should act.
What may be the greatest incen¬
tive to education among Moros to¬
day is the policy, inaugurated by
Superintendent Eduard Kuder, of
sending pensionados to Manila to
specialize in certain lines. This
serves as an inspiration, something
to strive for. It encourages compe
tition and developes the finest qua¬
lities among the aspirants.
Another outstanding phase of the
growing interest of Moros in educa¬
tion, as facilitated by the govern¬
ment, is the increasing number of
Moros being sent to school. In the
early years, Moro students in pub¬
lic schools were not only few but
were mostly boys. To-day, their
sisters are more and more coming
to join them in the endeavor to ac¬
quire that knowledge and learning
which the Moros need to bring them
to the level—in all respects—of
their Christian brothers.

MALACANANG
For fuliy a week since Wednes¬
day of last week Malacanang was
deserted, save of course for “Nick”
Kaminski, caretaker. G.-G. Murphy
blayed Santa Claus to children
on Christmas Eve, left for Baguio.
Entire Murphy family spent last
week and New Year’s Day in Ba¬
guio. Joseph E. Mills, financial ad¬
viser to the g.-g., accompanied by
Mrs. Mills and their daughter,
Judge and Mrs. Guingona, and Mr.
and Mrs. Eugenio Lopez, toured the
southern islands. Norman H: Hill,
secretary to the chief executive, Ed¬
ward G. Kemp and Captain El¬
bridge Chapman of the legal de¬
partment, were in the City of Pines.
Vice G.-G. J. Ralston Hayden re¬
mained in the city during last week.
Up in Baguio last week G.-G
Murphy considered the request of
Governor Severino Garcia of Sorso¬
gon that sum be set aside from the
Belo fund for relief work in Irosin,
which was recently visited by a
flood that caused several deaths,
destruction of homes, property,
telegraphed the Sorsogon governor
that relief funds of the Red Cross
will be sufficient to meet situation.
Last week it was reported that the
Red Cross personnel was effective¬
ly doing relief work among those
affected by furnishing shelter,
clothing, food.
Before leaving for Baguio last
week G.-G. Murphy revoked, upon
recommendation of the director of
lands with the concurrence of the
secretary of agriculture and com¬
merce, a proclamation of the office
of the g.-g. reserving a stretch of
land at the Port Area for the use
of the Manila Railroad Company,
reserved that land for park pur¬
poses under the administration of
the city of Manila.

The first official document to be
signed by Vice G.-G. J. R. Hayden
was the approval of P5,000 for the
purchase of an X-ray apparatus for
the Nueva Ecija provincial hospi¬
tal. Endorsement was signed last
week.
CABINER
Postponed last week to last Tues¬
day by Assistant Cabinetman Ano¬
nas, investigator, the hearing of the
case against Director Confesor of


commerce. J. C. Courtney Whit-
ney, local attorney, precipitated in¬
vestigation of the former "stormy
petrel" of the house of representa¬
ives by his charges alleging that
Director Confesor caused the col¬
lapse of the P. I. stock market. An¬
swered Confesor, in a 32-page re¬
oly: “It has been shown that Mr.
Whitney has not proved or substan¬
tiated any of his charges... All his
charges being false and unfounded
and purely the product of a vindic¬
tive mind, they should be dis¬
missed."
From Atty. Whitney came
sharp answer to Director Confesor’s
counter-charges to the effect that
they were unfounded, said that
Acting Secretary Vargas of agri¬
culture and commerce has shown
partiality in the investigation of the
charges Whitney has preferred
against Confesor. Sec. Vargas re¬
torted that he has not been partial
in the investigation of the charges,
added that he refuses to be an "in¬
strument" in the fight between
Messrs. Whitney, Confesor.

Acting Cabinetman Vargas, in
spotlight because of his recent con¬
nection with the management of
the P. A. A. F sweepstake enter¬
prise, last week answered criticism
launched against him, declared that
his participation in the promotion
of the enterprise was with the con¬
sent of officials vested by the civil
service rules to give such consent.

Despite the insistence of legisla¬
tors, insular government officials to


have the unexpended balance of the
public works appropriations
amounting to nearly P3,000,0000 re
leased immediately under the new
law amending the public works act,
the department of finance has re¬
fused to recommend the release to
the g.-g. until the account books of
the government for 1933 have been
closed.
* * *
A surplus of approximately
₱4,000,000, is expected according to
unofficial information obtained
from the department of finance last
week. Data on the subject are still
incomplete, but the report so far
gathered by the department, it is
said, indicates that there will be a
wide margin between the revenue
and the expenses incurred by the
government last year.
LEGISLATURE
Senate President Quezon, head of
the P I. independence mission in
Washington, D. C., dined with Pres¬
ident Roosevelt last week, returned
to New York Dec. 29 for "several
important conferences" on P I.
freedom. While he and other mis¬
sioners were discussing what sort
of formula to submit to the pres
ident, Isauro Gabaldon, former res
ident commissioner and representa¬
tive of the Civic Union, stole a
march on his colleagues by submit¬
ting a personal plan to the White
House, which proposed that indep¬
endence be granted the Islands with-
in two years, and a P. I. republic
set up. In the meanwhile, there was
discussed in local political circles
the sending of General Aguinaldo
and Judge Sumulong to U. S. ear¬
lier than they expected.
* *
Speaker “Twelve O'Clock” Pare¬
des is of the belief that the legis¬
lature will not reconsider its deci¬
sion rejecting the HHC law. This
is interpreted in some quarters to
mean that the speaker’s stand has
killed all chances of reviving the
law and having it reconsidered by
the legislature. The speaker, how.
ever, declared that everything will
depend on Senate President Que¬
zon.
* * *
Last week Solon Serafin Mara¬
but, chairman of the house appro¬
priation committee, commented on
criticisms launched against the new
law affecting teachers' salaries,
unheld the equity and instice of the


act, pointed out that since the law
provides for reduction of from 10
to 15 per cent of the salaries of all
insular employees for next year, it
was only fair and just that the
teachers share the same burden.
AT THE POLITICAL FRONT
Political parties are springing up
like the proverbial mushrooms now¬
adays. Reason for this, however, is
not hard to find, if we considen
that the 1934 general elections are
almost upon us. First to be formed
a few weeks ago was the Pro-Inde¬
pendence Nacionalista party. Last
week "Young Philippines," a na¬
tional organization of the youth of
the Islands, was born at a meeting
held in the home of former Speaker
Roxas. The latter helped in the or¬
ganization of party, offered sug¬
gestions. Organization committees
were formed at the meeting. Lead¬
ers of new party, among whom is
Arturo Tolentino, law student of
state university, plan to hold a na¬
tional conference in Manila either
on January 7 or January 17 to con
firm, proclaim the formation of
new civic organization and to dis¬
cuss important questions that vital¬
ly affect the country.
*
The minority last week reopened
its drive for the acceptance of the
HHC law with a statement from
Rep. Roxas urging revision of the
legislative majority’s attitude on the
law due to recent developments.
The minority, through Mr. Roxas,
again proposed to have the law ac¬
cepted for its acceptance expires
Jan. 17 and “all doors for a new law
or a better independence law or for
modifications and amendments are
closed."
Dissolution of all the local com-
mittees of the Nacionalista-Conso¬
lidado party, as well as the commit
tees of the anti Democrata faction,
to clear the way for the reorganiza¬
tion of both groups preparatory to
the coming general elections, was
unanimously decided last week at
a joint conference between anti De¬
mocrata solons, the majority legis¬
lators. Purpose of dissolution of
committees is to enable the control
committees of the respective fac-
tion to organize new ones and eli¬
minate at the same time the mem¬
bers of the old committees who be¬
long to the newly born Pro Inde¬
pendence Nacionalista party.

AS WE GO TO PRESS
In Washington, D. C., and Mani¬
la the independence fight goes on.
Last Jan. 1st a committee of promi
nent individuals, under the sponsor¬
ship of the Foreign Folicy Associa¬
tion and the World Peace Founda¬
tion, submitted a P. I. program to
President Roosevelt in Washington
providing for immediate expansion of
Filipino participation in responsible
government and independence after
10 years, with reciprocal trade rela¬
tions. On Dec. 30 Senator Quirino,
member of the P. I. independence
mission, was reported to be planning
to submit a plan to President Roose¬
velt providing for independence
after five years, and with a transi¬
tion period of five years thereafter.
In Manila Rep. Jose Zulueta
majority floor leader, declared Mon¬
day night that the legislature will
accept the HHC law before Jan. 17
if President Roosevelt should urge
on the U. S. congress that the law be
amended to meet the objections of
the Filipinos. From Senator Osme¬
na came word that the P. I. is
watching with interest for a con¬
crete proposition for independence
coming from Senate President Que¬
zon. Tre latter busied himself Dec.
30 in New York with conferences on
the P. I. independence question
with Henry L. Stimson and Theo¬
dore Roosevelt, both former gover¬
nors-general of the Islands.
Gregorio de Guzman, 45, of Sitio
Caritas, San Jose, Bulacan, was
hacked to death by Basilio Ylanda,
51, of Balintawak, in a caingin in
Sitio Macapili, Balintawak, last
Christmas Day. Corpse of dead
man was discovered in a creek days
after the crime. Confronted with
his crime, Ylanda was reported to
have confessed to the deed, alleged
“honor defense” when he declared
that he killed Guzman when he dis¬
covered the latter and his wife in
flagrante.
* * *
Restlessness flared up again in
the Bontoc regions, but this time
the resentment of the Igorot tribes
was directed not against gold inves¬
tors but against the government for
the alleged exorbitant tolls charged
on the Baguio-Bontoc road. Direc¬
tor Williams of public works went
on a hurried trip Tuesday noon to
the Mountain Province after a short
conference with Secretary Alas of
public works and communications,
was scheduled to preside over a
public hearing on the toll scheduled
for the Bontoc-Baguio road.
From Senate President Quezon
in New York City came a denial
Dec. 31, 1933, of Associated Press
dispatch regarding what took place
in his conference with President
Roosevelt. Quezon declared the
president was most kind and cour¬


teous to the delegation, is sympa¬
thetically open-minded regarding
the P. I. problem.

Juan Dimayuga, killer of the late
Enrique K. Laygo, is a hunted man.
Last week he failed to appcar be¬
fore the court to have his sentence
read to him. was still missing carly
this week. The police and constabu¬
lery are hunting for the missing
killer.
**
The infant 1934 was given a
thunderous welcome in Manila New
Year’s Eve. A 101-gun salute at
the army and navy club, added to
a whole battery of sirens, automo¬
bile horns, and noise-makers of
every discription, besides indivi¬
dual contributions from the throats
of 300,000 merrymakers, featured
the greetings to the lusty baby year.

Announced early this week by
Secretary Antonio de las Alas of
public works and communications
was his intention to continue this
year the policy he followed last
year of spending public works
funds strictly for maintenance pur¬
poses only, unless government fin¬
ances improve.
The first of several community
health, social centers planned for the
slum districts will be inaugurated
to-day, Thursday, in Tondo. It will
be housed at 1625 Calle Yangco, in
the building formerly occupied by
the Associated Charities.


THE NEXT SWEEPSTAKES
will be held in April. As in the
case of the one just held.

Cabinetman Sison of interior and
labor has placed his resignation in
the hands of the g.-g., is seeking
re-election to a seat in the senate
from the second district, with out¬
spoken Camilo Osias, resident com¬
missioner, as oppenent. His resig¬
nation, if approved, will take effect
next month.
* * *
Violent disorders broke out Dec.
29, 1933, in four provinces of Ar¬
gentina, resulting in at least a score
of deaths, the declaration of an in¬
definite state of siege by the gov-
ernment. More than 100 persons
were wounded in the initial fight-
ing.
MANILA
Well, the fight over the 1934 ap-
propriation ordinance for the Ma¬
nila government is over. Last
Friday evening Mayor Earnshaw
affixed his signature to the ordi¬
nance, which contained a grand total
of P7,189,118.36 for operating ex¬
penses. Budgetary approval was
done without any ceremony, in con¬
trast to the procedure observed in
previous years.

Sleeping is a healthy habit when
it is done at the right time, but
when one sleeps at night and he
happens to be a watchman on duty
the habit becomes disastrous. For
sleeping "on the job,” Watchman
Hugo Arellano and Maximo Trian¬
go of the city government, were
told by Santiago Ramos, city audi¬
tor, last week that their services
were no longer needed. It appears
that while the watchmen were hav-
ing their beauty sleep 100 liters of
gasoline deposited in the bodega
which the two men were supposed
to guard vanished.
Arrived Thursday was the French
flagship, Primauguet, under the


command of Admiral Berthelot,
commander-in-chief of the French
Asiatic fleet, with the dispatch
boat, Dumont D'Urville, was hon-
ored with a salute of 21 guns. The
Dumont D'Urville was scheduled to
leave Jan. 3 (yesterday), the Pri¬
mauguet, Jan. 11.
 *
Dee C. Chuan, former prominent
Manila business man and now high
commissioner of Fookien province,
blew into town last week on one of
his frequent visits here. Chuan: A
state of restlessness, uncertainty
pervades the entire province and
the tension is great. Fookien, ac¬
cording to reports, has recently
stepped on the toes of Generalissi¬
mo Chiang Kai-shek, is now the re¬
cipient of a great portion of the at¬
tention of the head of the National-
ist government of Cathay.
SPORIS
In a one-sided fight, handsome
Luis Logan, heavyweight champion
of the Orient, retained his crown
when he knocked out “Tiger" Al
Friend last Saturday in the third
of their scheduled ten-round bout
at Manila’s Olympic Stadium. A
left uppercut to the breadbasket
stowed away the army man for
keeps.
Playing at top form, Mrs. Elisa
R. Ochoa and Mrs. E. F. Martinez
of the Managumpay Tennis Club
retained the Metropolitan ladies"
tennis doubles title by defcating
Miss Irmgard Baumann and Mrs.
Mathews of the Manila Tennis Club
in the finals Saturday afternoon on
the Laong Laan courts by the scores
of 6-1, 3-6, and 6-2. Mrs. Ochoa
also won the ladies’ single crown.
Among the men, the final winners
were: Leonardo Gavia, singles; Ma¬
riano Servillon and Rodrigo Diaz,
doubles.

Fighting in Portland, Oregon,
Rush Dumaguilas recently took the
measure of Whitey Neal, scrapper
of that locality. Neal had the edge
in the first four rounds, but the
Pinoy pug rallied in the fifth and
sixth frames and downed his foe
twice for no counts. In a previous
bout, they battled to a draw.
* * *
Harry Fierro, invading bantam
flash, is scheduled to fight it out
with Jose Villanueva, of P. Y
World Olympics team fame, on Jan¬
uary 13th. A torrid bout is expect-
ed, as both boys are of first-rate
caliber. Villanueva is among the
best local bantamweights, while
Fierro has to his credit victories
over some of the best boys in the
division, including our own Little
Pancho.

dez of Sibonga, Cebu, Vice Presi¬
dent Rosalio Bacaltos, Gonzalo Uy¬
tico and Marciano Burgos, coun¬
cilors, recently made a trip to Mi¬
samis, Occidental Misamis. The

of the peace court of Sibonga, Cebu,
against Antonio Morales and Za¬
carias Montifalcon. The complain¬
ant is Tomasa Blanco, eighteen¬
year-old girl of the municipality of

girl one day while the latter was


returning home from a neighboring
barrio. Dragging her to a seclud¬
ed place, Antonio and Zacarias took
advantage of the girl’s weakness
and forced her to submit to their
wicked desires.

Nueva Ecija. The company pur¬
chased the Juan R. Lapuz Trans¬

Jose P. Bagtas, under-secretary
of public works and communica¬
tions, civil engineer, lawyer, is be¬
ing groomed to succeed Paul W

last week that as the 1934 appro¬
priation act does not provide any
fund for the salary of one of the
two under-secretaries of the depart-
ment of public works and commu¬
nications, either he or Anonas, the
other under-secretary, would have
to go. It is the consensus that As¬

BUREALS
Audits
Auditor J. Weldon Jones wants
the vacancies in the bureau filled,
requested G.-G. Murphy last week
to this effect. Recommendation
was his second official act. Audi¬
tor Jones explained that the filling

cause of the importance of the na¬
ture of the work in the various
branches of the bureau.

ARIS & SCIENCES
Further to the efforts of Prof.
Jeno Von Takacs of the conservato¬
ry of music to collect Philippine
native music: in a letter to the pro¬
fessor, Dr. M. Schneider, head of
the department of phonograph ar¬
chives of the German State Univer¬
sity, declared that that institution
will co-operate with Prof. Von Ta¬
kacs, will send over a complete pho¬
nograph recording machine to the
U. P. for the compilation of Philip-
pine folk music. The machine is
expected some time this month.
BUSINESS & FINANCE
Based on comparative figures
prepared by E. D. Hester, Ameri¬
can trade commissioner, is the
happy expectation that P. I. trade
with the outside world for last year
will net the Islands a favorable
balance of about P60,000,000, larg¬
er than in any other year in histo¬
ry, except 1917, 1927. Total trade
will be about equal to last year. To¬
tal exports will be from five to ten
per cent greater than 1932, while
total imports will be about eight
per cent less than 1932.

EDUCATION
State university officials will
ask the board of regents to increase
the appropriation for the U. P. sum¬
mer school, it was revealed last
week. Pointed out: that the said
summer school is a paying proposi¬
tion; that the sum appropriated for
it for 1934 is not enough to take
care of all its needs, being much
less than that provided last year;
that curtailing the school’s activi¬
ties by reduction of its appropria¬
tion would inconvenience the pub¬
lic school teachers who compose the
majority of its enrollment.

Against the background of Wilso¬

lec. 28 observed the 77th anniver¬
ary of Woodrow Wilson by re¬
hrasing his principles in the light
post-war developments. Roose
elt highly praised Wilson’s efforts
achieve world peace but reap¬
aised the effectiveness thereof,
salled attention to the league of na¬

Few changes in the recovery ma¬
chine are to be asked of the new
congress by President Roosevelt
was the general impression in of¬
ficial circles in Washington, D. C.,
last week. The president, it is be¬
lieved, is satisfied with the anti¬
depression campaign. His attention
last week was primarily devoted to
the preparation of a $6,000,000
budget for the 1934-35 fiscal year
to be presented to congress when it
convened yesterday (Wednesday).
The navy department is planning
to ask the authorization by con¬
gress of a ship construction, re¬
placement program designed to es¬
tablish the navy on a treaty parity
basis by 1939. Under present
plans, congress, convening this
weck, will be asked to approve two
resolutions one to authorize build¬
ing the navy to the strength allowed
by the London 1930 treaty or any
other arms agreement to which the
U. S. may become a party, and the
other to authorize the president to
naintain the fleet at that strength.

since coming there to live, has re¬

same time the French cabinet ap
proved a memoire to Germany say¬
ing that France refuses to discuss
the re-armament of Germany but is
willing to resume the conferences
on disarmament at Geneva. Learn¬
ed also last week was France’s will¬

the new Asiatic state of Manchu¬
kuo, opened Dec. 26 the 65th ses¬

koku Gikai. His Majesty, clad in
the full dress uniform of generalis¬
simo of the army, read his usual
stereotyped message in a loud, clear

guay striking a note of optimism
in his farewell address, saying that
the conference reaffirmed the com-
mon destiny of the people of the
American republic. Secretary of
State Cordell Hull, head of the U.

department at Washington, D. C.,
that better feeling exists among
the American nations than at any
time in the last ten years, started
for Santiago, Chile, on the first
stage of a goodwill journey to end

“Third, the increase of prices in
the United States may have an ef¬
fect on the prices of raw commodi¬
ties. Prices for these commodities
may therefore improve also in the
Philippines. However, this increase
in prices of raw commodities com¬
ing from the Philippines is prob¬
lematical. The attempt to keep
prices of finished articles in Ameri¬
ca down as low as possible, and the
attempt of American industrialists
to increase the wages of laborers in
consonance with the wishes of the
administration, may react against
any material increase in the price
of raw materials or commodities
coming from the Philippines. In
order for America to be able to
raise the wages of her laborers, she
must first have a supply of low¬
priced goods.
“Fourth, the probable inflation
program of the administration and
the depreciated dollar may increase
the ‘pesos-price' of raw materials
from the Philippines, which have
no competitors in countries operat¬
ing under the gold standard, or in
countries with more stable cur¬
rency than the dollar."
L. R. Aguinaldo, leading Filipi¬
no business man and owner of the
biggest Filipino-owned department
store, says: “The future is general¬
ly bright. There is much that we
can hope for. The Filipinos are
awakening to the business oppor-
tunities which are being offered
them. Our business men are get¬
ting the encouragement and the
support of both the public and the
government, and theirs is a rosy
tomorrow.
“As local business is linked to a
certain extent with that of the
U. S., I believe that recovery in
America may also affect the Philip-
pines. However, I am not in favor
of inflation. It may be all right
for some people, and for Americans,
but not for wage-earners and for
the common mass of Filipinos
whose buying power is limited to
what they earn. In this respect, the
year 1934 may be a dull year to
some. When inflation finally af¬
fects the Philippines, capital will
likely flee away, preferably to coun¬
tries of higher money values, like
England and France. The faster
the new dollars, or the new pesos,
under the inflation system are re¬
leased, the faster will some people

screech, the antis denied the pres¬

The Quezon mission in Washing-
ton has not yet submitted its plan
at this writing (anuary 2), but
Senator Quirino of the Quezon mis¬
sion gave out a statement (a feeler,
some believe) that he is in favor of
submitting a plan for independence
in five years and a transition period
of five years afterwards.
A committee of prominent indiv-
iduals, under the sponsorship of the
Foreign Policy Association and the
World Peace Foundation, submitted
an independence plan to the pres¬
ident. The plan submitted provides
for "immediate expansion of Fili¬
pino participation in responsible
government and independence after
10 years, with reciprocal trade rela¬
tions."
The committee’s program in
detail provides:
1. The Philippines should be
immediately given a system of
responsible government subjcct
to certain restricted rights of in¬
tervention by the United States.
2. While enjoying this status
the islands should have the right
to conclude certain treaties and
be represented in international
conferences.
3. This period of responsible
government should terminate at
the end of 10 years, subject to
the conclusion of an international
neutralization agrcement.
4. The United States should sur¬
render all naval bases in the Phil¬
ippines, effective upon the estab¬

ary. The big crowd at the turf
waited tensely for the start of the
drawing, while all over the Islands
people crowded around radio sets
waiting for the voice of the an¬
nouncer.
At eleven o’clock the drawing be¬
gan. Faces at the grandstands
watched eagerly the slow, monoton¬
ous procedure as the winning balls
passed from the big drum to a
smaller drum. Speculation among
the spectators increased as the pro¬
cedure dragged on. At the press box
a police reporter assigned to “cover"
the event dropped to a sob sister
belonging to his paper a remark to
the effect that his winning the P75,-
000 prize was "a cinch.” “Well
there is a little church around the
corner," wise-cracked the female
reporter. “I guess I’d better give
you the whole P75,000 then," retort-
ed the police news hound.
By twelve o’clock three hundred
thirty balls, the prize-winning ones,
had been selected. The first lucky
balls of P200 each, numbering two
hundred fifty, were drawn and eli¬
minated. Dr. Ylanan read the num-
bers with the assistance of Judge
Moran, Col. Livingstone, Col. Alcid,
and Don Leopoldo Kahn. The num-
bers were recorded and later broad¬
cast by the radjo announcer to the
four corners of the archipelago.
From the remaining eighty balls in
the small drum, forty balls, repres¬
enting the P500 prizes, were select¬
ed. The same procedure was observ¬
ed as in the case of the two hundred
fifty balls. Of the remainig forty
spheres twenty, corresponding to
the ₱1.000 prizes, were drawn. The
last twenty balls in the drum cor¬
responded to the tickets that were
scheduled to participate in the race,
but in view of the fact that there
were only eighteen horses running
in the race, two of the balls were
eliminated and adjudged winners ofl
two of the P3,672 prizes. The pairing
of the last eighteen numbers with
the horses entered for the big race
started at 4:45, while the horses
and their respective jockeys were
kept at the 1-748 mile post and com-
munication with the jockeys was ab¬
solutely barred.

drawing of the winning numbers
was made without a hitch. The de-
lays were caused by the difficulty
of the judges in reading the num¬
bers on some of the balls, due to
the wearing off of the aluminum
paint. Don Leopoldo, ilI at ease
under the blistering heat, as well as
the other judges, had to resort to
magnifying lens to identify the
balls. In one instance the tube
through which the balls passed from
the small drum to a glass container
broke, thereby causing the judges
to question three of the balls. Two
balls among those selected to win
the two hundred fifty P200 prizes
were also questioned by the judges
on account of the illegibility of the
numbers on them.

However, there is little capital to
leave the Philippines. The infla¬
tionists’ idea is always to create an
illusory but temporary respite pri¬
marily through the manipulation
of money-values. For the present
the main dependence of city mer¬
chants is on the employees. When
inflation comes, they will be forced

ranks of politicians which makes
1934 a politically turbulent year,
what with the announced “clash of
the century" about to transpire.
President Rafael Palma, veteran
politician, former senator, and re¬
signed head of the University of
the Philippines, says: "we expect
a great showdown in 1934. The
year will test whether the people
understand fully the issues con¬
fronting them, or whether they
really want independence or not.
Also, it will be a test as to whether
the Filipino people are willing and
ready to sacrifice for liberty. The
next policical election is perhaps
the most interesting and most de¬
cisive that we will ever witness
during our lifetime, and its result
wiil determine to what degree the
Filipino people love liberty."
Senator Claro M. Recto, heir
presumptive to the powers that go
with the majority party, says: “To
forecast now what will happen dur¬
ing a year bound to be fraught
with uncertainties is as idle as it is
improper. Many have taken it upon
themselves to calculate the strength
of the new majority—politically—
and the weakness of the new mi¬
nority—also politically—and vice
versa. I would not do the same
thing. I can only say that my col¬
leagues and myself are confident
that the year 1934 will see a real¬
ization among all concerned of the
wisdom of our stand and of the
ideals of the new majority.”

with conditions obtaining here, the
new head of the department of pub¬

errors, commit myself on the edu¬
cational outlook for 1934.
“I have always been interested in

January 4, 19:


RIZAL QEVERAL days ago the country mourned the
passing of our national hero: Rizal. It is
not saying a new thing to state that Rizal Day has come to
mean little more than the opportunity to have a grand and
glorious holiday. But we are tempted to say it again. It
would be a concession to barbarism to let vulgar “homages”
to the hero pass without a challenge.
Rizal should mean something more than the opportunity
to lead civic parades, crown beauty queens, recite “patriotic"
pieces. Rizal stands for something, and no greater honor
would be paid the hero if those who feign homage to him
would devote more of their time to thinking of Rizal’s labors
and less of biass bands and orations.
And it is not at all as foolish as it sounds if it is said
that the present differences among us will resolve themselves
to practically nothing were we to remember Rizal and what
he stands for more than we do the opportunity to have a
hilarious time on the anniversary of his death. For Rizal left
behind some very definite ideas. It would be impossible to
be misled by them. It is about time we stopped erecting
monuments to him and began really honoring him.
FPHAT feeling of delicacy so character-
IT'S NOT
DONE HERE I istic of responsible men in public of¬
fices in other countries simply does not
obtain here. The feeling that men holding public offices
should be meticulous about their personal activities lest they
be accused of using their offices for personal gain is so little
respected in this country that it can be said to hardly exist
here at all.
To the charge that this or that official has been guilty
of callousness in allowing himself to be involved in transac¬
tions which cannot but reflect upon his feeling of delicacy if
not-upan hi. Lonesty, the defense is that he did no more than
what other officials have been doing all along. There is here
no effort to deny the guilt, but even an attempt to justify it.
And unfortunately, the public seems to share this tendency to
treat with tolerance such lack of fine scruples in its officials.
This explains the persistence of the very insidious
practice of many officials to exploit their offices for personal
gain. The public “understands," and is even sympathetic.
NOTHING TO nHERE seem to be those who object to
having our more backward peoples-
CONCEAL
the Igorots, the Negritos, etc.—filmed,
obviously on the ground that the resulting pictures might give
the impression abroad that we Filipinos are not as advanced
as we pride ourselves on being.
On our part, however, we see no reason for making a
fuss about the matter. To be sure, unduly exploited pictures
have practically libelled us in the past, but there is no call
to be hypersensitive about it. Rather should we view the
matter with tolerance and a sense of humor. There is no
harm in having our mountain folk filmed, so long as they are
not ballyhooed as representative of the Filipino people.
UNWORTHY FRHAT political asininities have been
 injected into so memorable an oc¬
casion as the commemoration of the 37th anniversary of the
death of Rizal is to be regretted. The incident, although gen¬
erally looked upon as unimportant to-day when graver ques¬
tions are at issue, should not be overlooked.
We make no pretense of being able to counsel what would
have been better for both Speaker Paredes and Councilor
Torres to do under the circumstances, or of being able to in¬
dicate the border line between what is proper and improper
 as subject for Rizal Day speeches. But we find it deplorable


that political differences have somehow been allowed to creep
into the reverence of the people for their dead heroes.
The case would not appear striking were it a lone one.
When the new Bonifacio monument was inaugurated a
month ago, a similar incident—the efforts of certain officials
to eliminate others from the list of committee members—re¬
sulted in what many termed then as "planting political ban¬
ners on the grave of the dead.” A repetition of that incident
obtains in the Paredes-Torres case of this week, re-enforcing
the impression that we are forgetful of the ideals of those
whom we honor.
INNOCENT MOROS? NT is said that a number of
1 Moros now serving 17-to-20-
year prison terms in Bilibid for murder are men expiating
for a crime they never committed. The bureau of non-Chris-
tian Tribes has been informed by a former constabulary of-
ficer that there are proofs that the men now under confine-
ment are, so to speak, the wrong party.
That there should be a thorough investigation of the
case is almost superfluous to say. It is bad enough any time
to punish innocent persons, but in this case there is some¬
thing of as much importance as the justice involved. It af-
fects vitally the government’s Moro policy.
There is no denying the fact that no little of the troubles
in Moroland are due to the lack of faith of the Moros in our
courts of justice. Many of them do not believe they will get
a square deal in Christian tribunals. And the imprisonment
of innocent Moros will not help their people increase their
faith in the ability of their Christian brothers to give justice.
Give the Moro incontrovertible proofs that he can be sure
of justice at the hands of his Christian neighbors and the
greater part of the so-called Moro problem will disappear. And
there is no better agency for increasing the faith of the Moros
in the ways of peace and order than our courts.
"LOOKING TRHERE is something indomitable about
I this good, old world of ours. Like the
FORWARD”
proverbial man worth his salt, there is no
keeping it down. It may repeatedly be jolted by hard bumps,
buffeted about by wild winds, and generally battered black
and blue. But somehow, it manages to “come up smiling.”
Right through the debris of crashed endcavors and toppled
hopes, it rears up anew its globe of a head, "bloody but un¬
bowed.” And on that bloody face, you will still find a smile
—the smile of the undefeated.
That is why, happen what may, we can still be merry
when Yuletide comes around, and still hopeful every time a
new year looms on the horizon. This still fragrantly fresh
1934 is no exception. Its immediate predecessor has seen dark
and dire things: threats of war and downright dissension,
little if any let-up in the economic disorder, and other none
too cheering aspects. But with the shelving of 1933 and the
trotting out of 1934, we can still be optimistic and courageous.
Everywhere, a rosier year is augured, by hard-boiled busi¬
ness men and perennial idealists and informed observers. And
in all this, there is more than mere self-delusion, more than a
gallant but pitiful attempt to put in practice the Coue theory.
For tomorrow is full of pleasant possibilities—always. It is
not, like the past, something irretrievably lost or irreparably
done. It is still to come, to be lived—in a measure to be
determined.
That "fighting and suffering brotherhood.... Mankind,”
does well not to give up hope. For while Mankind must suf-
fer, it should not be content to let it go at that. It must also
fight—to go on. And fighting presupposes hope.
