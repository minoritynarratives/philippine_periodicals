A Rich Family's Magazine At A Price
A Middle-Class Family Can Afford!


Graphic, has everything a man, woman, or child wanis in
a complete magazine.


r HE history of the   is the story of any fine
Iproduct. Eight years ago it was a highly problem¬
atic" venture. Today, with public confidence steering it,
and never failing to deserve that confidence through excel¬
lent service, it has become the leading weekly magazine in
English in the Philippines.
The great majority of advertisers look for their profits to
the margin between average earnings of families and the
amount these families must spend on the bare necessities
of life. The amount left over when daily needs have been
satisfied, represents the potential buying power for qual¬
ity, convenience, and luxury.
  is a rich family’s magazine sold at a price that
families who belong to the middle class can very easily af-
ford. It goes to the homes of people whose "luxury mar¬


gin" is essentially both middle-class and upper-class. For
its format and contents are such as to appeal strongly
even—perhaps especially—to the reader of rich family re¬
sources and background, and yet is so priced (only P0.12 a
copy) as to be within easy reach of those whose tastes may
he similar but whose means are not so ample.
Balanced circulation is one of its important factors. Read
by men and women in equal proportion, it has become the
best medium for national advertising. It stands near the
top among magazines circulated in Luzon, and TOPS ALL
OTHER MAGAZINE IN ENGLISH in the Visayas and
Mindanao in circulation.
Our weekly circulation report will show you where every
copy goes. 24.000 copies every week, and every copy a sel¬
ler!

AYBE you are one of those parents
who shake their heads because your
L'A children appear so lacking in res¬
pect for the old Faith. But have you ever
tried to explain the situation, find out
why? On page 4 we have two opinions
concerning this very thing called irreli¬
giousness of young people: one of Dr. Sin¬
foroso Padilla of the department of psy-
chology, U. P., and the other of Dona Rosa
L. Sevilla de Alvero, directress of the
Instituto de Mujeres.
NHIS is the opening paragraph of a let-
A ter our Mr. Retizos received from a
woman in Surigao: “I am a  
reader and recently I came across your
article, Women Are Not So Helpless, in
 ’s issue of February 13th. This
article has interested me so much that I
have written to you for some help or sug¬
gestion within your knowledge that may
help me in my present difficulties.” The
difficulties you will find on page 10. For¬
tunately, Mr. Retizos is a lawyer, so we
suggested he do something, and he did—
try we mean—and discovered a few
things you will be surprised to know your¬
self about justice in this country.
PrIIS number of   is not an
agony issue by any means, at least it
was not intended to appear that way. But
we admit we have a number of tales of
suffering and abuse in this number.
Why must Bicolanas (see page 9) so he¬
roically carry on this business of supply-
ing cha
 cabarets? And the Presi¬
dent keep this civil service ruling barring
promotions (page 11) over one grade?
And sweepstake agents mulct the people
with their share-ticket racket (page 15)2
Turn to page 12 and see if your town
can match San Pablo’s (Laguna) town
characters.
T EMEMBER the first time you tried
Ib telling her and did not know how?
Well, you will in Felixberto Balbas’ Ten¬
der Leaves. A woman, it is said, never
forgets — and she does not, at least, in
Mrs. Vicenta A. Lacsamana’s Camias in
the Moonlight.
M. E. Arguilla told us he did not
think much of Mother Tanner by John
Lineaweaver. So, read it. Anyway, the
story first appeared in the North Ameri¬
can Review and was included in E. J.
O’Brien’s “Best Short Stories: 1934.”


DAINTER PABLO
AMORSOLO once
spoke glowingly to us
about the ability of Miss
Anita Magsaysay, this
week’s cover artist. She
is another School of Fine
Arts product, who
took up painting and
A. Magsaysay
cartooning, and graduat¬
ed in 1934. Many of her paintings have
been exhibited in many art exhibits in Ma¬
nila and one of her works has been sent
to Spain for exhibition there. Miss Mag¬
saysay is from San Antonio, Zambales,
but lives in Manila with her father, En¬
gineer Ambrosio Magsaysay of the Me¬
tropolitan Water District. Her residence
is 413 Paz, Paco, Manila.

Flowers from Baguio:
“.. .I don't see how you can do all those
things. Be careful not to overdo it. Don't
flatter yourself that you become more hef¬
ty the harder you slave: some of those
fellows out in Santolan were as husky as
your brothers, let alone yourself. And when
you lose your health this way it’s darned
hard to regain it.
" the latest issue of   af¬
fected me queerly. It was so good—very
good, believe me, types and topics and every¬
thing—that it made me long, actually, to
get back and be in the thick of it again.
Queer I say, because up to now it’s only my
friends and my folls whom I’ve missed. Not
the drudgery! Or perhaps I should say the
battle to beat the other papers or at least be
shoulder to shoulder with them... —A.E.L.
Good Lord, we didn’t know we are
that good! Say, Al, do you mind writing
the boss about it, huh?
 OMETHING happened to our plan to
S present this week two articles on
education: one by Dr Perez of the voca¬
tional division of the bureau of education
and the other by Dr. Butler, retired su¬
perintendent of schools. We hope to be
ready by next week.
Our weakness for sociology manifest-
ed itself again when it came to our mind
to get into the private affairs of husbands.
It was an excerpt from an article by Paul
Popenoe, director of the Institute of Fa¬
mily Relations, in Los Angeles, Califor¬
nia, that gave us the idea. It seems Pope¬
noe discovered that college graduates do
not make the best wives. Is it true, what
Paul Popenoe said? we ask ourself. Well,
there is only one way to find out. Sociolo¬
gist D. H. Soriano is directly in charge
of the job.
D H. S. also has promised to give
the low down on Manila’s new chief of
police: Col. Antonio Torres.
A. C. Anden discovered the other day
that he did not know Manila as well as
he thought. He immediately decided he
would get acquainted with the Capital
better, went out and returned bulging
with facts. He threatens to tell  
readers all about what the average Mani¬
lan does not know about his town in our
next issue.
Fr'HE literary editor wrote us about his
I great indignation concerning the ab¬
sence (since his departure) of the custo¬
mary pictures and other identification da¬
ta in   short stories. Will short
story writers please send in their pictures
and whatever useful information they may
like to give about themselves with their
manuscripts?
“Never mind the order of the foreign
stories so long as you run on'y those I
tell you to run: I know more about them,
vou see, having read them all and know¬
ing their sources. For next issue: Fame’s
Little Day by Sarah Orne Jewett.” You
guessed it, this order is from Baguio.

That Model Household


wF there is one country the world fears to-day it is
A Japan. She is feared not only by weak nations. Even
the mightiest countries look in the direction of Japan
with unveiled concern. For not only has Japan demon¬
strated that she can hold her own against the most up-
to-date of armies and navies. She has demonstrated that
she can take markets away from the control of industrial
countries of the Western world.
And Japan is feared because nowhere in the world are the
people better united, more patriotic, more self-sacrificing, better
conscious of the importance of unity of action for the sake of the
common welfare. At least, so it appears to the outside world.
It is this solidity, this oneness of the Japanese household as
it were that has made Japan so much feared and so much ad¬
mired. The leaders of the household decide to do something and
immediately every member of the household bends all his efforts
to accomplish the thing. No questions asked, no doubts raised.
The heads of -the household have made the decision. That is
enough.
And this is not, for the world, a comfortable situation to con¬


template. Here is Japan bent on "going places" and not over-parti¬
cular how she gets there. And as long as not enough of the
70,000,000 Japanese dare question the wisdom of this idea of
going places” the way Japan is doing it, Japan will always be
an object of fear. And the world is about ready to believe the
Japanese will not dare question it.
But are the Japanese really as united as the world
thinks they are? At least, are they as united as they
were before? Is the Japanese household still the model
kind it used to be?
Little as the world knows about the real cause of the recent
military revolt in Japan, the incident is eloquent proof of the fact
that there are differences of opinion in the country, differences
which cannot but be serious considering the violence that has de¬
veloped from them. And the anxious world cannot but be relieved,
however little, at this manifestation of dissension in Japan. It
likes to interpret this as a sign that perhaps a portion of the Japa¬
nese people are trying to redirect Japanese thought and action in¬
to ways more acceptable to other peoples.

AS WE GO TO PRESS
To Face Oil Scandal Charges
Court action will be taken against
4 persons involved in the recent
petroleum exploration lease scandal,
it was learned last Monday. Suffi¬
cient evidence has been gathered to
warrant the prosecution, the com¬
mittee en mines of the National
Assembly was informed.
Killed In Ipo Mine Shaft
James L. Hall, general superin¬
tendent of the Ipo Mines Co., died
in a shaft of the Ipo mines last Sun¬
day morning, when he fell 150 feet
from the iron hoisting bucket in
which he and some companions
were riding up the 65-degree in¬
cline.

Italy May Withdraw From League
A possible withdrawal from the
League of Nations and repudiation
of the Locarno treaty are included
in the new foreign policy being for¬

Murphy Urges Early Confab
The early holding of the proposed
trade reciprocity conference be¬
tween the U.S. and the P.I. Com-
monwealth is being urged by High
Commissioner Murphy, it was
known last Monday. The confab

ARGUILLA HAS DONE IT AGAIN
Short-story Writer Manuel E.
Arguilla has done it again: broken
into another high-class fiction
magazine in the U.S. Several
weeks ago it was mentioned in this
weekly that Arguilla’s "How My
Brother Leon Brought Home a
Wife” was accepted by Story. He
is the first Filipino to have a story
accepted by that publication.
Now the latest issue of Prairie
Schooner includes Arguilla’s “Mid¬
summer.” Jose Garcia Villa had
previously been recognized by this
magazine. Both of these stories
are woven around the simple life of
the barrio folk in the province
where the author hails from: La
Union.

T is absurd to ask if we are
getting irreligious; the fact is
A very obvious, very painfully
glaring. I have not arrived at the
conclusion simply because of the
very palpable fact that relatively
fewer people go to church now as
in the past. For to me church at¬
tendance is not a very accurate
criterion of the religiousness of an
individual. One may go to church
simply for ostentation, to make
oneself pointed out as a religious
person.
If we must accurately gauge the
religiousness or irreligiousness of a
country, we must take into account
the contentment and happiness of
its people, its internal peace, the
crimes committed. Economic pre¬
cariousness is not so potent a factor
in destroying the peace of a coun¬
try as the discarding of religion.
A country may be poor and yet
peaceful and happy.
The number of suicides in the
last few years clearly indicates the
younger generation’s irreligious¬
ness. The young no longer seem
to trust in the power of God to help
those who are in need. Young peo¬
ple faced with absurdly little prob¬
lems take their own lives as if
these were theirs, as if no other
thing could help them out of their

misery They lose their battles be¬

indicates that we lack the strength
that only religion can build.
It is not so much the lack of fear
of our laws as the fear of God that
breeds crime in our country—or any
other country for that matter. A
truly religious person will realize
that even if he escapes from the
laws made by man, he cannot escape

fully glaring.”


from the laws made by God.
The bloody uprisings among the
masses, the spread of communism
and banditry, the crimes of all sorts
committed every day—all these are
tangible evidences that we are get¬
ting farther and farther from the
Lord and at times even forget or
doubt His existence.
Our government perhaps over¬
looks the fact that religion tends to
bring the people to a harmonious
(Cantinued an naga 50)


ELIGIOUSLY minded folks
all over the country are be¬
IWcoming alarmed at the
thought that our young people are
becoming irreligious, if not im¬
moral, and, what seems worse yet,
becoming cynical in their attitude
towards life. There seems to be an
opinion generally shared by those
zealous in their religion that our
youth is breaking the speed limits


Dr. Sinforoso Pad Ila: “Youth in
noter ousty the period of conflicts and
doubts
in its mad race towards what is
sometimes cal'ed the "damnation
bow-wows.” In short, the charge
is that our young people are not
on'y certainly going to the dogs,
but they also seem to be in a hurry
to get there.
The charge that our young peo¬
ple are becoming irreligious is not
a new one. Every generation that
has gone before had heard that
same charge. And it is not to be
wondered at, for youth is notorious¬


ly the period of conflicts and
doubts, intellectual as well as emo¬
tional. In every generation the
world for the adolescent youth be¬
comes so complicated and so rapid¬
ly changed that it would indeed be
a wonder did they not become some¬
what unadjusted even in their reli¬
gion.
But are our young people really
becoming irreligious? The answer
depends more or less upon one’s con¬
cept of religion. Unfortunately,
there are as many definitions of re¬
ligion as there are those who care
to define it. In addition, there are
many religions existing even in our
own country to-day, each religion
claiming the honor of being the
only one. And to add further con¬
fusion into the problem, one of the
major religions of mankind, Chris¬
tianity, has so many branches, de¬
nominations, and sects, each claim¬
ing superiority over the others, that
one be he young or adult is left
wondering as to which of them is
the right one. It is true, for in¬
stance, that Christ said, “I am the
way, the truth, and the light," but
those who followed Him parted the
ways, distorted the truth, and
dimmed the light. Witness the
many branches of the Christian re¬
ligion; how through all the centur¬
ies, even to the present day they
have quarreled over the question as
to which had the right way, truth,
and light. In the Philippines, for
instance, the Roman Catholics, the
Independents, and the Protestants
do not, cannot, and will not agree
in their interpretation of Christian¬
ity.
In a world of confusion such as
this, it is no small wonder that our
adolescent youth should become be¬

PAGE 5


wildered and unadjusted in its re-
ligious views. And if apparently
our young people have become irre¬
ligious it is only because there
seems to be little agreement be¬
tween their religious ideas as taught
them by the established religions,
and their experiences in the world
of reality as explained to them by
the Sciences. For the fundamental
assumptions of religion, in the sense
in which religion is preached and
taught in the established churches,
contradict those of science. For in¬
stance, a child may without ques¬
tioning accept the truth of the
creation story in Genesis, that the
world was created by God in six
days. But by the time he has gone
through his adolescence he will
have gone through high school and
college, and he will have learndi,
from his sciences not only a differ¬
ent story altogether, but also one
at variance with his religious be¬
liefs and teachings. Again, he may
have accepted in childish faith what
religion has taught him, that in a
day man was created in the image
of God from a lump of clay, only
to learn in high school and in col¬
lege that man has reached his pre-
sent stage gradually through a long
process of evolution, involving mil¬
lions of years instead of only a day.
Then, too, if he looks around at all,
he will wonder why, if man was
created by God in His own image,
God did not make men all alike, but
instead made some black, some
white, and the rest of varying de-
grees of shades. And if he is a
normal individual at all, he will also
wonder as to which road to follow,
whether the one which religion
points out to him or that which
science opens for him. Nor can
youth lock assuringly to religion
for guidance, for he cannot fail to
see that various religions are point-
ing to different paths, some nar¬
row and straight, some broad and
circuitous, some short cuts, and
some detours.
With such glaring contradictories
and confusions in the realm of re¬
ligion, youth must endeavor to pick
its way to attain it ideals. The in-
evitable happens, for youth unable
to find a solution to the puzzle will
fall back on some sort of a mild
skepticism, if not cynicism, as a
sort of defense mechanism. Stud-
ents of adolescent behaviour fre-
quently tell us that youth is the age
of skepticism. It may very well
be, for more often than not, they
are lost in the labyrinths of reli¬
gious dogmas and creeds on the one
hand, and of scientific hypotheses
and theories on the other. In short,
youth is all fed up, and is suffer-
ing from mental indigestion as a
result of the clashes between the
beliefs of early childhood and the
scientific facts acquired in adole¬
scence. Youth has learned enough
science to discard religion, but un¬
fortunately has not learned enough
science to reacquire religion.
Whether or not our youth is be-
coming irreligious is a matter of
opinion, depending upon what mean¬
ing we may give to religion. If by


religion we mean the acceptance of
the traditional beliefs in the dog¬
mas and creeds of an organized
church, then it may rightly be in¬
ferred that our youth is not so
much irreligious but indifferent to
religion. In a study made some
years ago, the writer sought to dis¬
cover the nature of beliefs of high
school and college students concern¬
ing God, Christ, Holy Ghost, Devil,
Heaven, Hell, Immortality. The
results showed consistently that
young people tend to reject their
traditional beliefs as they advance


from high school through college.
This discarding of older beliefs is
in accordance with what we already
know concerning mental growth.
Childish beliefs in fairies and in
Santa Claus are discarded as chil¬
dren grow older. The same thing
happens to religious beliefs.
In his book, The Belief in God
and Immortality, Professor Leuba
of Bryn Mawr. found that the per¬
centage of those believing in a per¬
sonal God and in immortality de¬
clines through college years, and
that among scientific men, the


more eminent ones have lesser per¬
centage of believers than the scien¬
tists of lesser rank have. His ex¬
planation for this decline in belief
is in terms of differences in intel¬
lectual ability and in terms of
temperamental independence. The
growing intellectual and tempera¬

Stopped Violin
Prodigy Abcede's
San Francisco
Concert Last
January
By P. C. MORANTTE
Los Angeles, California, U. S. A.


“It took little Felix Abcede, 9-
year-old violin phenomenon from
San Mateo, just 10 minutes to con¬
vince a large and discriminating
audience at the Philharmonic audi¬
torium last night that he was not
another infant prodigy in the
usual sense at all but a full¬
fledged artist who could hold his
own with the best and biggest,”
said Carl Bronson in a Los Angeles
paper of Felix Abcede after the
latter’s bow as a concert artist.
And the homeland at the news of
the boy’s triumph was genuinely
proud of him. No less than the
President of the Philippine Com¬
monwealth congratulated him.
But when a dispatch from the
United States came that Prodigy
Abcede failed to appear for his

scheduled appearance in San Fran¬
cisco, California, on January 6th
because he “did not feel like p'ay¬
ing," everybody was disappointed,
his countrymen more so, of course.
But it should interest disappointed
admirers of young Abcede, that
there is a story behind the boy’s
failure to appear in San Francis¬
co. And it was not about the so¬
called temperament at all.
(CRVEMPERAMENTAL Los An¬
geles Boy Violin Genius
ABreaks San Francisco
Date," runs the headline of the
Evening Herald and Express, car¬
rying a syndicated news story
about 9-vear-old Felix (Sityar)
Abcede, Filipino violin prodigy.
Master Abcede was scheduled to
make his debut in "Frisco"
last
January 6th, but was unable to
play because, according to the pa¬
per, "Felix did not feel like play¬
ing....is very temperamental and
hasn’t touched a violin for a fort-
night.” The paper attributed the
statement to the boy’s father, his
tutor Josef Borissoff, and his man¬
ager Arthur Judson.
But just why the paper neglected
the boy’s and his mother’s side of
the story, I could not understand at
all. So when Felix and his mother
returned to Los Angeles, I imme¬
diately went to see them, for I was
quite certain there was a human
story behind the seemingly one¬
sided news item.


Prodigy Felix answered the
doorbell and ushered me in, beam¬
ing as we shook hands and said
hello to each other. But instantly
we lapsed into respectful silence.
For in the anteroom his mother
was talking vehemently over the
phone and we did not want to dis¬
turb her.
Felix invited me to an armchair.
I sat down. “Mother will be with
you in a minute. Excuse me,” he
said as he withdrew to an adjacent
room. His mother saw me and
recognized my presence by a nod
and a cordial smile over the re¬
ceiver. I responded accordingly.
From where I sat I could hear
distinctly what she was saying. I
did not mean to eavesdrop but I
could not help it. "No, I don’t want
my boy to have anything more to
do with him,” she was saying. "He
thinks my son can’t get on in the
world without him....I am Felix’s
mother... yes, I have obtained the
legal guardianship of my child....
the court upholds my right.... I
paid nine hundred dollars for the
boy to go to New York and for
what?.... Yes.... Uh-huh... Fe¬
lix is my son and as his mother I
will manage him the way I see fit,
what I deem is best for him,
see?...."
She hung up and approached me.
I spoke first. “Mrs. Abcede, I
couldn’t help overhearing what you
said over the phone. Has there
been a misunderstanding between
you and Prof. Borissoff?”

Daily, throughout the Philippines, pro¬
vident farmers are planting rice or coconuts,
knowing full well that if the seeds are not
sown, there will be no harvest. After plant-
ing, the farmer does not just rest in ease.
For weeks and months and years he tills the
fields and constantly nurses the growing
crop to maturity.


A man, confronted with the vast field
of life, likewise sows his seeds in accordance
with his requirements. There are children
to educate and clothes to buy, so he plants
each week a small sum of money into the
fertile field of insurance, knowing well that
on maturity the harvest will amply provide
for his wants.

Y MPERSONATED by Eduardo
(Dan) Zamora, eccentric little
Adamson, whose antics have
delighted   readers, cop¬
ped the first prize for the “best or
most natural impersonation of
any character appearing on the
comic pages of local papers." at
the carnival auditorium last Thurs¬
day night.
Swaggering with his inevitable
cigar and cane. Adamson was easily
the most faithful representation
among the comic characters that
competed in the contest sponsored
by the Gridiron C'ub. “When I was
asked to participate in the contost,”
Dan Zamora said, “the first comic
character that came to my mind
was Adamson. Perhaps because he
is a very unique character and he
is a story without words. You see,


At the right is Adamson,

you’ve got to prepare
a special skit for other
comic characters to
make them funny. But
not Adamson.”
Dan Zamora, who is
a cartoonist in his
own right, confessed
that he is an Adamson
addict. “I had, how¬
ever, to make a care¬
ful study of the man¬
nerisms of the character be¬
fore the contest,” Mr. Zamora
said, "to make my interpretation as
close to the original as possible."
Despite the fact that he had only
one day to prepare the Adamson
mask, clothes, and paddings, these


were very accurate in detail.
A habitual winner of costume
contest prizes, Mr. Zamora has
copped around 42 prizes since he
started competing in 1924. He has
so far lost only about three times.

PERDITION
OESON
Among Bicol Lasses --Traffic
In Women Continues
By PERSEVERANDO CARO


Bicol women, before they come to Ma¬
nila, have dreanis of good fortune and
respectability.
UNDREDS of mothers in the
Bicol provinces cry over the
II lving—daughters lured by
slick agents to the city, stranded
there and have not come back or
sent a word home.
One afternoon I heard an aged
mother challenging one agent to a
fight because he took her daugh¬
ter to Manila and she had not
heard from her since. Several
such unscrupulous agents infest
the Bicol region and are popular—
notorious, rather—because of their
numerous victims.
Victimizes Relatives
These agents employ sub-agents


who get a peso or, when business
is brisk, three pesos for every girl
that they lure. The sub-agent
selected is often one who has many
relatives having many daughters.
Shutting his eyes to the sacred-
ness of blood relationships, this
sub-agent approaches a relative
and talks volubly on the advant-
ages of sending the daughter to
the city. He promises a good and
honest job for the girl and assures
the parents that she will be in safe
hands.
A contract is signed jointly by
the girl and the agent, the cere¬
mony being performed before a
justice of the peace. The mother
cries because it is the first time
her daughter is leaving her. But
the agent presses a five-peso bill
in her hands and she stops crying.
He a so buys clothes for the family
to assure them further.
The girl is taken to the house
where the agent lives. When the
agent has collected a sufficient
number of victims, he takes them
to the railroad station to wait for
the train that would take them to

USTICE to those who can af¬
ford it! That, bluntly speak¬
 ing, is the way justice works
out in this country. Injustices are
perpetrated; but the guilty, if he
is opulent, goes scot free. The vic¬
tim, if poor, finds himself lost, un¬
able to assert his rights, while an
army of fiscals and deputy fiscals,
bureau assistant attorneys and
public defenders look on. They are
not allowed by law to do anything!
We discovered this last week
when a wife, who read “Women
Are Not So Helpless," in GRAPH-
IC’s February 13th issue, wrote
back requesting advice. She was
the victim of cruelty and injustice,
and her plight was brought by
  to the attention of the
authorities. Without any success,
let it be shamefully said. But to
get on with her story first.
Abandoned By Husband
For ten long years this woman
toiled and saved, teaching school,
to feed a healthy husband and four
growing daughters. The husband
spent her wife’s salary on women
and gave her, in return, constant
abuses, insulting insinuations, and
family squabbles. After ten years
of heartbreak and sacrifice on the
part of the wife, they separated.
“I took my four children with me
to my father’s home,” wrote this
wife, from Mindanao, "believing my
husband’s promise that he would
provide for them. After a month,
I left with my children for a change
of residence as I could not very well
allow my father to provide for me
and my children."
She did her best to make a liv¬
ing, to feed and clothe her daugh¬

ters, and send them to school too.
But it was too much for the un¬
happy wife.
Husband Keeps Mistress
“I communicated with the father
of my daughters, to at least help
provide and educate them. In re¬
turn, I only received written pro¬
mises. He wanted to have the chil¬
dren, but I have a better judgment
of him and know he is not fit to
have them since I’ve heard lately
that he is living with a woman,
having two children with her al¬
ready.
“This year I decided I would ap¬
peal to justice and so asked a law¬
yer to write to him for the chil¬

dren’s pension, since they are in a
Sister’s school for the last two
years. I even wrote I would agree
to his paying only one-half for the
children’s school and board.”
Lawyer Gives Case Up
The lawyer started writing the
husband since May, 1935. He re¬
plied, many times, continually as¬
suring support for his wife and
children. They remained, however,
mere assurances.
“The lawyer,” she continued, "de¬
cided to file a suit against him last
month. Whether he has already
done it or not I have not heard from
the lawyer so far. If he did not
file the suit, I should regret it very
much since probably he is not much
interested in the case as he cannot
get much money from me to pay for
all the work, and that is what hurts
so much."
Four Children Suffer
“One becomes so helpless when
you don’t have money. It seems
that just on account of being poor
and helpless, four innocent children
have to suffer and lose their right


as citizens of the Philippines.
“Many times I had to suffer the
complaints of my children from the
school’s treatment whenever I failed
to send in the regular monthly pay¬
ment. Only recently one of my
children almost died from neglect
since I had not been able to pay the
school for three months. Can you
be so kind enough to help us out
with your suggestions?”
Sees Bureau of Justice
 , however, was not con¬
tent with just furnishing sugges¬
tions. Action, to get the desired
result, was urgently necessary. The
bureau of justice was approached.
But a responsible bureau official
shook his head.
“No, the bureau of justice can¬
not handle such personal matters,"
the attorney said. “We handle only
criminal cases, and suits in which
the government or its officials are
involved."
So there it was, in a nutshell.
Even to give official advice, as
coming from the bureau, to an
abandoned and financially harassed
wife, was not possible.
Chief Public Defender Seen
Foiled at the justice bureau, an¬
other recourse was tried. The pub¬
lic defenders, perhaps, can be re¬
quested to prosecute the case. But,
another setback! Public defenders
turned out to be governed by very
definite regulations too.
explained
“Strictly speaking,”


Cannot the government da something
for a mother and her children who have
been left to suffer by the head of the
tamily?


March s, 1936


An abandoned wife seldom, if ever,
gets the justice she seeks.


Attorney Juan L. Lanting, chief of
public defenders, “the work of our
men is to defend poor, indigent
persons accused of committing
crimes punishable by the statutory
laws and the Revised Penal Code.
“The other work is to settle dis¬
putes between laborers and employ¬
ers, regarding salaries withheld by
the latter; to enforce the Work¬
men’s Compensation Act, and to
handle cases for the laborers where¬
in any compensation is due them. In
those acts, the public defender per¬
forms, as you see, the duties of an
attorney of labor.
“Questions regarding persons and
family relations, under which this
woman’s case falls, are not within
the scope of the public defender’s
duties,” he explained. “Besides,
that would be encroaching upon the
domain of the private law practi¬
tioners. A public defender, of his
own volition, can give legal advice
to her though. But she is too far
away, we don’t have defenders in
every province, and it will be im¬
possible to help her, in a legal way,
by letter.”
Even a fiscal would not, perhaps,
file a suit for her. Hers would be
a civil action for maintenance and
support. A fiscal’s job, and he
won’t deviate from it, is to prose¬
cute criminals and put him behind
prison bars. That much he will

He'd Rather Wait
Nor A Better 9o0
Writer Disagrees With President's
Statement And   Editorial
Concerning Jobs
By ROBERTO MADARIAGA


Y y E received the following let¬
ter in answer to our car¬
toon-editorial in our issue
of February 13th. The writer here
vividly describes the injustice that
the civil service ruling against
promotions over one grade can
perpetrate.
Your editorial, “They Do Not
Want to Work,” of February 13th,
last, sounds very nice. But just al¬
low me to state my case and you
will understand why many idle peo¬
ple, though starving, won’t care one
withered buyo leaf for the jobs that
President Quezon announced he
would give anyone who approaches
him.
I am a recent B.S.E. graduate
of the University of the Philip-
pines. I am also a senior tea¬
cher eligible with marks not so
very bad because I was among the
first ten of the successful candi¬
dates who took the examination
last year. Being poor, I had bor¬
rowed the money that I spent dur¬
ing my stay in college. After grad¬
uation, because I was unable to get
a high school job (for which I ob¬
tained special training in the gov-
ernment university), because my
creditors were continually hound¬
ing me, and because the family was
starving, not to say anything about
my brother and sisters' not being

able to continue in the elementary
school, I applied for a teaching job
in the elementary grades. Luckily,
I was given one. It was a tempor¬
ary municipal job at the rate of
₱42.50 a month, and in my own
native barrio. I accepted the job
(God, how relieved the family
was!), with bright hopes that
would get a call to come to a high

school before long.
And indeed, after a short three
months, I received an offer from
the Director of Education to come
to this high school where I am now,
to teach for ₱100 a month on a
provincial appointment. Of course,
since I had been banking on just
that. I resigned my municipal po¬
sition and came up.
But now, I find that in compli¬
ance with a Cabinet resolution, I
may be given only P10 more than
my former wage of P42.50, on the
splendid ground that an employee
in the government can be given an
“increase” of only one civil-service
grade at a time. On the other hand,
if a new or an idle graduate got the
job, he would have been given the
proposed salary of ₱100 without any
question.
And so, here I am, teaching in a
big academic high school far from
home, in a big town where I pay
P25 a month for my room and board
and P5 for my laundry, where my
responsibilities in school have been
multiplied at least fourfold, where


many a man) who starves in this
country is he who is too sensible
and self-respecting to accept a job
if the pay is too beggarly for his
needs in the job and for his edu¬
cational qualifications, and if the
pay in the temporary position will
pull him down later on, even as it
has undone me.


President Quezon: said “the man who
starves in talis country i
tne man tno
doas not want to work.”


contribution-collectors swamp us
every so annoyingly often, where
my fellow teachers receive from
₱120 to P300 a month, where I can
no longer wear the old patched
ccats and pants that I could wear
in the simple barrio school where I
taught—here I am, teaching for the
same amount of P42 50 per month:
only P42.50 even because the De¬
partment of Public Instruction
would not give me the staggering
"increase” of P10, as I had taught
for only a period of three months,
whereas at least a year is required
before an employee may be given
a raise, it is claimed. I would a
thousand times like to go back to
my former station, but when I in-
quired whether I could do so, I
learned that the vacancy had been
filled, of course. I can only remain
thankful that I did not succeed in
getting the road-hand’s job that I,
in complete desperation, even ap¬
plied for early last year for P0.50
a day, else I would be getting to¬
day the tremendous sum of P15
every month in this same high
school! What with my college debt
of ₱1,500 haunting me continually
and what with my ignorance of
beautiful rulings like this, I even
went so far as to apply for the po¬
sition.
Now, Mr. Editor, please tell me
if for any earthly or unearthly rea¬
son a college graduate should not,
instead of accepting a low-pay job,
prefer to loaf and plan trouble
with the bandits in the homeplace
or turn Sakdalista or sleep his young
days out, in the reasonable hope
and expectation of getting a less
disgraceful pay later on. Please
tell me if the government does not
thereby encourage indleness and dis¬
hearten the needy and the poor like
me, who have to accept any job to
make both ends meet for the time
being and then get penalized by the
government for the professional ex¬
perience they get in the temporary
employment that they hold "while
waiting," as you very romantically
said, "for a more profitable job."
Please tell me if His Excellency the
President was not more wrong than
right when he said that “the man
who starves in this country is the
man who does not want to work.”
Please tell me if it is not more cor¬
rect to say that the man (at least,


Editor’s Note:
We still be ieve that a man, es¬
pecially the educated kind, has no
excuse for being hungry in this
country. The civil service ruling
prohibiting promotions over one
grade was handed down only last
year and yet all the years before
we have had this cry of unemploy¬
ment, even hunger, from men who
should have, because of their edu¬
cational attainments, been more
resourceful, more willing to go out
of his chosen profession to earn a
living, and less prone to assume
the pose of help essness.
We realize the injustice that the
civil service ruling in question is
inflicting and we have joined the

San Pablo, Laguna, Has Three-
Harmless Individuals All And
Amusing
By JUAN B. HERNANDEZ


J. B. Hernandez


ORE often than not, what
leaps to the mind when
M the old home town is re¬
membered is the quaint town
character who stood apart vividly
from the crowd of mere ordinary
human beings. Each town has its
share of these odd fellows who
may be idiots, cranks or merely
eccentrics.
The Smiling Fool
It seemed as if we slept one
night and woke up the next morn-
ing to find Emer with us. Where
he came from, who his parents
were (or are), and why he chose
our town, San Pablo, Laguna, we
could not tell.
He must have had a handsome
form. His arms, now sunburnt
and always unclean, are still as
soft and pliant as a pianist’s. A
complaisant pair of dimples stil
frisk on his cheeks at every twist
of his lips.
"Uy! Dalaga na!" Thus bland-
ishes Emer every time he sees a
lass. At times he gets a harsh re¬
tort for his pains, but he responds
with a complacent titter and walks
on with his usual serene gait, un¬
mindful of the cares of the world
around him. He is content with
his sullied rags and battered hat,
his only earthly possessions.
Emer, the smiling fool, loiters
round and round the town with no
definite place to go, bestowing on
every soul that he meets his gra¬
cious and indefinite smi e. He
smiles at street urchins who throw
stones at him; at grown-up men
who poke fun at him; at house¬
wives who chase him with brooms
each time he offers his services
for a meal. He even smiles at
dogs that snarl at him.
He loves best to gather flowers
for the dead, flowers to be made
into wreaths. He finds joy in
accompanying the bier to the ceme¬
tery and seeing the face of the dead
before it is lowered to its grave.
Then after filling his eyes with
the sight of the pale face, he
would smile faintly and turn away.
Almost every day Emer sees the
sorrow-racked forms of the be¬
reaved, hear their agonized sobs.
Then a transient gloom would veil
his face, only to be chased by his
usual faint smi e. And then he
would be walking on again, to
scatter his timid smiles.


Emer, the smiling foal of San Pablo,
Laguna: finds joy in accompanying biers
ta the cemetery.


Leon Kawit, alias "Papaya"
He is Leon to himself and to his
relations, but “Papaya” to the
thousands who throng the streets
of San Pablo. He does not like
the monicker, of course, but it
seems he would not be happy if he
had not been named thus. He gets
a thrill chasing children who
shout "Papaya” at him. When
there are no mischievous boys to jest
him, he looks weak and frail and
tired.
They call him a fool, an idiot, a
scamp. He does not mind. Some
reprove him; others taunt him.
Many even threaten him. He does
not seem to care. He tramps on
through the streets of the town,
waiting, expecting, aching to hear
somebody shout, "Papaya!” Then
the single word goes to his head
like strong wine. It excites him,
gives him life and vigour. It
pumps life and buoyancy to his
weary legs. There is wrath on his
lips and he gives the chase, but
there is thrill in his heart.
Leon Kawit, alias "Papaya” is
now a lame man in rags. He be¬
longs to a decent family of the
town. His children and grand-
children are respectable people of
the community. How he got to be
called "Papaya” has several ver¬


sions, each apparently credible.
Why he prefers the life of a tramp
to the peace and comfort of the
bome cannot be explained. Des¬
pite the incessant counse’s of his
kin, he would rove from one street
to another, carrying with him his
inseparable iron rod and chasing
mischievous urchins who shout
"Papaya" at him.
Marikokut, the Braggart)
Street urchins do not rail at
Marikokut, the town braggart. For,
massively built and with a thun¬
dering voice, he commands fear
among the children. He does not
enjoy a truant life and does not
tramp the streets. On ordinary
days he frequents the wine store,
the barber shop, and the gambling
den. In the store he takes his
much-needed drink; in the barber
shop he exhausts his lungs with
his empty boasts of self-import-
ance. In the gambling den he
gets the diez centimos (alms from
the winners) with which to buy a
drink.
Life to Marikokut can be re-
duced to drinking wine and boast¬
ing. When not given a chance to
spout his usual vainglories, he be¬
comes visibly spiritless and with-
out vigour. During pre-election
time, the candidate and his liders
reserve a seat for him on the im¬

WHERE WOMEN DO
MAN-SIZE JOBS
By MARCIAL DERECHO


FrVHE home was the place for
women—until the financial de¬
A pression came. Then, 'way down
in the Ilocos, women started out
from their homes early in the mor¬
ning and worked with men in the
construction of roads, wielding
shovels and picks all day long.
In my home town, Danao (Cebu),
women are likewise not particular
about jobs so long as they are hon¬
est. They do not think that manual
labor degrades them in the eyes of
young people and society. They do
men’s manual work even at mid¬
day, realizing that their parents
who have many chores to do at home
should not be further burdened
with other work.
It is not rarely that women in
the Islands go to the fields and
plant or harvest grain. In my
town, women besides doing such
comparative'y light work, also
p'ow the land, till the soil, and man¬
age the farm throughout the year.
During the mill’ng season, many
women work as laborers in sugar
centrals: they cut canes and carry
them to the wagons. Otherwise
they clear the hillsides for their
kaingins, hew down big trees, hoe
the ground and plant corn. As a


sideline, these sturdy women raise
fowls and hogs.
Others engage in pot making—
and skilled pot makers they are.
too. There are those who weave
buri hats and baskets. Weekly, the
town market is flooded with these
skillfully made baskets and hats.
Loom weaving is likewise a luc¬
rative work for other women.
These begin working early in the
morning and stop only when it gets

FNHE Cand of promise”: that is
what Mindanao has been for
a long time already. Until
now she has remained so, dis¬
appointing hundreds of home-seek¬
ers who saw in that fertile island
visions of immense wealth, which
persistently remained as visions
due to the inaccessibility of great
areas of the island.
The committee on Mindanao and
special provinces of the Assembly
will introduce for the consideration
of the National Assembly during its
next regular session a measure pro¬
viding for the construction of roads
and other permanent improvements
in Mindanao, based on an elaborate
construction program which will be
carried during the whole transition
period. Last year the National As¬
sembly passed a bill reverting the
necessary amounts from the Quiri¬
no-Recto colonization fund for the
construction of roads to probable
colonization sites in Mindanao.
Another measure which the com-
mittee will handle during the
next regular session of the lawmak-
ing body is the proposed abolition
of the bureau of non-Christian
tribes as a separate government en¬
tity. The majority of the members
of the committee believe that the

men peddle fish; a few manage
modiste shops.
Through with the day’s work, wo¬
men in my home town go out to
parties and dances. They realize
that all work and no play is not
good for their bodies and minds.
But it is “Work while you work,
and play while you play” with them.

y T is very obvious that if the
Philippines must have fairly
A adequate protection with the
country’s present rather meagre
resources, it has to rely rather
heavily on the aviation arm of its
fighting forces. That the air force
can easily make up for a country’s
weakness in naval strength has
been shown in the present Euro¬
pean crisis deve'oping out of the
Italo-Ethiopian conflict. England
had sought to cow Italy into
abandoning the Ethiopian invasion
by the concentration of the mighty
British fleet in the Mediterranean.
But Italy replied to the British
threat with a counter threat backed
by Italy’s air force, one of the big¬
gest in Europe and certainly big¬
ger than England’s. Mussolini, in


effect, threatened an aerial at¬
tack against the British fleet in the
Mediterranean and England was
forced to ease up British pressure
against the Italians.
Just what part the air force will
be allowed to play in the national
defense of the Philippines, the Na¬
tional Defense Council created by
the President has not yet revealed.
But there is no doubting that there
will be an air force, and already
severa' men have been sent to the
United States to study in the U. S.
army aviation schools.
Barring one tragedy—the fatal
airplane crash of Major Porfirio
Zablan, P. C.—the nucleus of the
P. I. army air corps has been doing
rather nicely. Lt. Marcos Soliman

and Manuel Alcantara, a civilian,
finished their air studies abroad
and came home sometime ago. And
only last week, another pensionado,
Lt. Vicente Luna, arrived home
from Randolph Field (Texas), the
West Point of the air.
Lieutenant Luna is a lanky six¬
footer of an officer who is still in
his twenties. He spoke of army
flying as nothing dangerous.
Chosen By Elimination
“There were 24 of us, officers
and civilians, who competed for the
post,” Lieutenant Luna said, refer¬
ring to the selection for aviation
pensionados. “Only 12 came
through after the rigid physical
examinations. There were some
more tests and finally Lieut. Jose
Francisco and I were selected to go
abroad and report for instruction
at Randolph Field, Texas.
“We were not the first ones sent
there by the Philippine constabula¬
ry, though. Lt. Marcos Soliman
and Manuel Alcantara, civilian
aviation cadet, for example, had
preceded us to Randolph Field by
some three months. Lt. Francisco


and I left the Philippines Septem¬
ber of last year and arrived at the
flying school in October. There
were with us some 135 U. S. army
officers and American civilians
who reported for flying instruction
that October."
The aviation students at Randolph
Field, Lt. Luna explained, are com¬
posed of two kinds. One, the stu¬
dent officers: army officers, from
licutenants up, who were sent there
by the U. S. army to take up fly-
ing. Another, the flying cadets:
civilian young men taking up fly¬
ing who, after finishing the course,
are attached to the U. S. aviation
corps for another year of training,
after which they are either made
regular aviation officers or simply
placed in the reserve.

Unscrupulous share-ticket agents
and corporations have perpetrated,

despicable racket. Some have so
perfected their system of fraction¬

) ARRIO folk are notorious for
spending all their lives on a
square kilometer of earth.
Not so the people of Barrio Ma¬
timbo, many of whom have seen
the length and breadth of Luzon
and even the Visayas. Matimbo
is an insignificant barrio of Malo¬
los, Bulacan.
They are not all men, these Ma¬
timbo mat peddlers who climb
mountains and cross seas to reach
customers. Many of them are wo¬
men, and not all are married at
that. Lasses and swains from this
barrio, as well as middle-aged hus¬
bands and wives, travel from place
to place with piles of mats on
their heads, shouting, "Banig, ba¬
nig."


it
Every Tuesday, Matimb
peddlers flock to the Calu, it
market and purchase from Panr
pangueno wholesale agents mats
woven in Apalit, San Simon, San
Luis, and other towns of Bulacan.
These peddlers from Matimbo are
almost the only buyers there, as
those living around the place pur¬
chase only what they can use.


Romance sometimes comes to the lives of
those wha peddle mats.


These sturdy later return to
their barrio with their purchases.
They trim the mats, decorate them
with beautiful figures—f owers,
stars, vines, etc.—done with col¬
ored buri leaves.
Buy Leyte Mats Too
For variety the Matimbo ped-
dlers go to Manila to buy Leyte ti¬
kug mats from the Chinese dealers
on Santo Cristo. The mat peddlers
can get mats from the Chinese
dealers on credit as they have
been proved honest persons. The
accounts are settled when the mats
have been disposed of.
The peddlers cover practically
the whole area of Luzon and most
of the Visayan provinces. The
mining camps of the Mountain
Province, the homesteads in the
Bicol region, the sugar plantations
of Negros have been penetrated by
these hardy peddlers. How they
manage to sell their articles in
these remote regions is a wonder
because most of them know very
little English and less of the dia¬
lects of the people to whom they
sell the mats.

Comparatively Ligit Work
ho is
A Matimbo mat peddler,
past the forty year mark and who
has been at the job for over jif¬
teen years now, said he chose tre
work because it is light and is re
munerative. “I had worked as a
farm hand, factory hand, and car¬
gador before I switched to mat
peddling,” he said. "And I will
stick to it.”
A woman peddler said the mar¬
gin of profit is sometimes small,
but at times many times the buy¬
ing price. Those who cover such
provinces as Cavite, Nueva Ecija
Batangas, Laguna, and Tarlac are
glad if they can sell their mats at
twice the buying price. But those
who go to the Visayan provinces,
or even only distant points in Lu¬
zon, ordinarily do not part with
their articles un'ess the price is
more than double the buying price.
Romance Is Bred
Many couples in the barrio had
the beginning of their romance in
their selling expeditions. Not all
the romance sprouts among the
peddlers themselves. It takes
place also between the peddlers
and the daughter or son of the
family in whose house they lodgo


One peddler married a young girl
from Taytay. Rizal; another a lass
from San Ildefonso, Cavite. A girl
mat pedd er won a youth from No¬
veleta, Cavite.
Well Informed
The Matimbo mat peddlers do
not read newspapers but are well¬
ver ed in current affairs. They
pick all the gossip in the places
where they go. In many instances
they were present in some of the
scenes that have figured promin¬
ntly on the newspaper pages. For
instance, they saw t he gruesome
nses at Cabuyao, Laguna; the
cory
stones washed away by the
tom.
floed waves at Lingayen, Pangasi¬
nan; the scene of the tragic pre¬
ection affair at Santo Tomas,
batangas.
It is no wonder that they are
more broad minded than the aver¬
age barrio folk. They have learned
not to mistrust people in other re-
gions of the Archipelago. And
because they have tasted the hos¬
pitality of other people in far¬
flung spots of the Islands, they
have become very hospitab e them¬
selves. They have become very
tolerant of other men’s views but
they reject communi-tic tenden¬
cies.

 ANY a government official
has resigned from the serv¬
Aice and has advanced as
reason the fact that he had already
served the government long enough
But Celedonio Salvador, the new
superintendent of city schools, who
will celebrate in September, this
year, his twenty-ninth year of serv¬
ice in the bureau of education, be¬
lieves that a public official should
stay in the service as long as his
services are necessary.
The new superintendent of city
schools started his career as
a mere classroom teacher
almost twenty-nine years
SE
ago. While he was still in
the first year, high school,
he passed the junior teacher
examination given by the
bureau of civil service and
was offered a teaching po¬
sition. His parents were
too poor to send him to
Manila to study. When,
therefore, the offer was
made to him to become a
teacher, he readily accept-
ed.
Many new schools were
oeing opened at the time
and school teachers were
much in demand. There
were not enough high
school and normal school
graduates and teaching
obs were open to anyone
who had the necessary qua¬
lifications. He was given
an assignment, as an insu¬
lar teacher, to teach in the
public school of Nabua,
Camarines Sur.
Celedonio Salvador was
soon made principal of the
Pili Elementary School. A
few years later, he was
again made classroom
teacher of Goa, and still
later, principal of a bigger
school, the Naga Elementa¬
ry School. Later, he was
made assistant supervising
teacher in the district of
Tinambac. Not long after¬
wards, he was made permanent
supervising teacher in the district
of Calabanga, same province. In
the years following, and until 1919,
he held the same position in the
towns of Paracale, Daet, Naga,
Iriga, and Daet (again).
In 1919, the insular government
decided to send more deserving Fi¬
lipino young men to the United
States to study in American colle¬
ges. The bureau of education was
invited to send its own men. After
closely examining the records of
its young principals and supervis¬
ing teachers, and after gathering
intimate reports about the candi¬
dates, Celedonio Salvador was


picked out and notified to prepare
for the trip to the United States.
Director Luther B. Bewley strong¬
ly recommended his appointment.
Salvador left the Philippines in
1919 together with Jose P. Laurel
Florentino Cayco. Judge Feliciano
Ocampo, former Director Vicente
del Rosario, Director Lucas, and
other pensionados. He proceeded
to Indiana. He enrolled in the Uni¬
versity of Indiana and in 1922 was
granted his A. B. degree "magna


cum laude." In passing, it is in¬
teresting to mention that H. A.
Bordner, the retired superintendent
of city schools, and Celedonio Sal¬
vador, Bordner’s successor, are
both graduates of the University of
Indiana.
Salvador returned to the Philip-
pines soon after his graduation. He
was appointed division superintend¬
ent of schools and ordered to pro¬
ceed by the first available trans¬
bortation to Masbate. There was
however, a marine strike at the
time and the young superintendent
could not leave for his new post. As
the position of superintendent in
Zambales was vacant at the time, he


was ordered to go to Zambales in¬
stead. He stayed in that province
for four years. While serving his
fourth year in that province, he re¬
ceived a promotion and was made
vermanent division superintendent
of schools. A year after, or in
1926, he was transferred to Batan¬
gas. After staying in Batangas for
five years, he was sent to Rizal
province, where he also stayed five
years.
Last February 18th, he took his
oath of office at Malacanang as
superintendent of cit y
schools before Vice Presi¬
dent Sergio Osmena, secre¬
tary of public instruction.
The position which Mr.
Salvador now occupies is
one of the most coveted in
the bureau of education.
Mr. Salvador is the first
Filipino to be appointed to
it, although Florentino
Cayco, former assistant
superintendent of city
schools, had at various
times occupied the position
in a temporary capacity be¬
fore he retired from the
government.
The appointment of Cele¬
donio Salvador was a sur¬
prise to many, and was
even the subject of adverse
comments among the mem¬
bers of the municipal
board. The reason for this
s that powerful political
figures had their own can
didates for the position
when H. A. Bordner signi¬
fied about a month ago that
he was leaving for the
United States. However,
President Quezon, basing
his choice on merit and not
on political influence, picked
out the former Rizal sup¬
erintendent of schools from
a great number of for¬
midable candidates.
Mr.
Salvador indicated that he
is very grateful to Presi¬
dent Quezon for the latter’s
confidence in him.
The superintendent of city
schools was born in Naga, Camari¬
nes Sur, on March 3, 1890. He is
the son of Apolonio Salvador and
Maria Ambrosio.
Celedonio Salvador is married to
the former Miss Cecilia Suzara. He is
a member of Phi Beta Kappa, 1922;
Pi Gamma Mu, 1928; and is vice
president of the Philippine Asso¬
ciation of School Executives. He is
also a member of the advisory com¬
nittee on community assemblies
originally created by former Gov
ernor-General Theodore Roosevelt.

No sooner had he alighted from
his car than a policeman came
along, blowing his whistle loudly.
“You can’t park there. There is a
spot across the street. You can
park there, not here!”
The man, apparently in a hurry.
drew his key from his pock¬
et, tossed them to the traffic cop.
“Will you park it there for me?”
he said and hastened away.
The officer asked the driver of
an automobile near-by to park the
big car across the street.

ITA was only fifteen years
old when she received a let-
IVter. When the mailman


handed it to her in front of her
classmates in the intermediate
school yard she did not know what


to do. She blushed furiously and
Hesitated to accept the letter. But
she finally took it and slipped it
hastily into her book. Her class¬
mates saw the letter and they
crowded around her.
“Let us see it,” they said jest-
ingly.
Rita did not show them the let¬
ter. Tightly she hugged the book
containing the missive, her face ra¬
diant and a smile threatening to
break out any moment.
Now her chin had a proud tilt.
She was feeling more important
than her companions. A responsi¬
ble young girl now. Very proud.
Like Eliang, her aunt, who used to
receive love letters from Anchong.
Along the railroad tracks with
Bibang, her friend, Rita nervously
opened the letter and skimmed over
its contents. It was a love letter
from Banong, a childhood playmate
and until recently her classmate.
But they had not talked to each
other much after they had out¬
grown their childish games. When¬
ever they met each would look
away.
Rita read the letter many times.
The phrases, “Rita, you’re beauti¬
ful like an angel. I have loved you
since we were children," warmed
her heart. Was Banong really sin¬
cere?
Bibang teased her.
“He might be fooling me only,"
Rita said. "What shall I do, Bi¬
bang?”
"Don’t mind him.”
"How?”
“Don’t answer him until he
writes the tenth or eleventh letter,"
Bibang advised her.
Rita did not seem to agree with
her friend. Suppose Banong should
stop writing.
With the love letter in her hand
she sat on a trunk beside their
window and looked dreamily at the
gentle swells of the wide rice fields
heavy with grain. The setting sun
was soft behind the hills.
Silently, Rita stood up, a distant
look in her eyes.
She went into the silid and
emerged from it with pencil and
paper. She sat down and began to
write. "Dear Banong,” she wrote
many times and each time hesi
tated. Finally she wrote, “Dear
Sir.” Her gaze wandered as she
strove to put on paper her feelings.
It was already almost dark and she
had not gone farther than “Dear
Sir.
From the kitchen her mother
called. Rita was startled, and im¬
mediately hid the paper in one of
her books. Her mother said it was
time to cook. Her father would
soon arrive.
She sat beside the stove while
waiting for the rice to boil. Ba¬
nong’s letter was in her hand and
shyly she read its contents again
and again. She was thinking of
Banong. How courteously he
spoke, how handsome he was, how
gracefully he walked. But should


she answer "yes" so soon?
Two days later Banong and Rita
were walking side by side along the
asphalted provincial road. It was
afternoon and Rita had just left
school on her way home. Banong
was endeavoring to say something
but he only kept craning his neck
as if clearing his throat. Rita was
expectant and blushing.
"Rita," Banong finally said.
“What?” the girl looked at him
and their eyes met.
"Did you receive my letter?”
“I received it two days ago.
Why?”
“Is there any hope?”
Rita lowered her eyes and did
not say anything.
“Is there any hope, Rita?” Ba¬
nong repeated.
Rita glanced at him briefly, sil¬
ently, and then at the sun.
Banong,
she said finally,
“please go away now."
“You don’t like me to go with
you, do you?”
“People are looking at us, can’t
you see?”
A Pantranco bus was speeding
towards them. Banong gingerly
held her hand and led her to the
side of the road. Rita felt happy
but embarrassed and told Banong
to please leave her alone.
“You love me, Rita, don’t you?"
Banong was getting bolder.
“My mother will get angry, said
Rita, lowering her eyes to the
ground.
Banong laughed and Rita
laughed with him a bit.
"Please, Banong, go away now,
will you?”
"Will you then answer my letter,
Rita?
"Ill see. I think I can’t.”
“You are the only girl I love in
this wide world,” Banong told her
boldly.
Rita smiled a little and looked
away, and then looked at Banong
and said nervously, “Banong, please,
don’t accompany me. I can go
home alone."
“But Rita, do you love me?”
"Please go away now,” Rita re¬
peated. They were nearing a group
of houses.
"Im not doing you any harm."
“I know it, but...., she looked
in the direction of the houses,
please leave me alone."
Banong lost his smile and was
silent a long while. When he spoke,
he said, “Then give me back my
letter."
Rita paled, but she was brave.
“You can have it back, she said
with a tilt of her chin.
“I'll not write you anymore,” Ba¬
nong said, hesitating to accept the
letter.
“I don’t care, Rita said as she
increased her gait and left Banong
fingering the returned letter.
She pushed the gate open violent-
ly, her chin still up in the air. She
went upstairs in a hurry and went
straight to the silid.

Camuas in the Moonlight
by Vicenta A. Lacsamana


—HE sat at her desk before a
pile of papers, her green
S eyeshade protecting her eyes
from the glare of the electric light.
What a night! Lesson plans to
write, papers to check, and grades
due tomorrow.
Ignored was the moonlight which
had filtered through the leaves and
rested in patterns on the floor near
her feet. Ignored, too, were the
camias blooming in the night. Oth-
er nights she would have been
among the camias, bending over
them for a whiff of their fra¬
grance.
On the papers her pencil raced
leaving red marks. Disturbing
were the shouts of children playing
in the moonlight. She bit the end
of her pencil: "Shall I flunk him?”
Annoying were the murmurs
from the neighboring porches.
“I must have made a mistake. I
shall have to compute all over
again."
“When orchids bloom in the
moonlight," a girlish voice full of
life drifted in and floated to her
ears.
She looked up from her work.
“And lovers vow to be true,” the
girlish voice continued.
She put down the pencil she was
holding. That song was so disturb-
ing. Might as well listen until the


girl had finished her song.
“When orchids bloom in the
moonlight,” the girlish voice re-
peated.
A light breeze blew some papers
on her desk to the floor. She did
not stir. She had leaned back, her
hands over her head, resting on the
back of her chair. “Not orchids,”
“When camias
she said softly.
bloom in the moonlight.” Why did
she think of camias? She should
not, she thought, but she was think-
ing now.
Another moonlight, on another
porch, some years ago. Below the
porch camias opening in the night
perfumed the air. Bits of moon¬
light fell in patches on the steps


where they sat. It was strange how
things lingered on. Just a bit of
moonlight, just a whiff of , camias
in bloom!
"I am going now. But I am com¬
ing back next year when the ca¬
mias bloom again in the moonlight."
He turned and walked down the
pathway. There was a mist in her
eyes as she turned away from the
night that had lost its enchantment.
“Mother, he is gone. I am not
going to leave you at all,” she said
as she sat by her mother’s bed.
Long before the camias came
again she was carrying flowers to
a new grave.
The camias for years had come
and gone. Each time she saw the


camias bud, then blossom in the
moonlight. And even when the last
of the season’s bloom had drooped
yellowing on the stalks, she could
not close the hope out of her heart.
Sounds of familiar footsteps.
Suddenly he was by her side in his
old handsome self, the lovelight still
in his eyes. "Darling, I’ve come
back, when the camias are bloom-
ing in the moonlight.”
Silly, she thought, stirring up the
past that had better stay dead. But
then why should he come to her so
lifelike tonight? Papers rustled on
her desk. She bent over her work
again. Her pencil raced over pa¬
pers, leaving red trails behind.
Airplanes were crashing quite
often these days, she thought, as a
news item about another crash
caught her eyes in the morning pa¬
per. Pilot got lost in fog. Plane hit
the side of a mountain. All aboard
killed. The victims....
The paper slid from her fingers
and rustled on the floor at her feet
as she struggled to see him again
through fast-filling eyes, see him
as he came last night when the ca¬
mias were blooming in the moon¬
light—and the lovelight still in his
eyes.

By JOHN LINEAWEAVER


 NLIKE so many mothers,
Mrs. Tanner did not expect
 that things would ever again
be the same between herself and
her son, once he had married. She
said so to every one, smiling brave¬
ly: "A daughter’s a daughter all
her life; but a son’s a son till he
gets him a wife.” There was noth-
ing truer, was there? she asked.
And when some of her listeners,
remembering what mother and son
had been to each other and reflect-
ing that now by her own indirect
admission in an unguarded moment,
Mrs. Tanner would have very little
left to live for—when some of these
listeners demurred, she simply
shook her graying head, still smil¬
ing bravely, although by this time
there was more often than not the
suggestion of tears in her aging
eyes, so pitifully, so innocently blue
—so like an unhappy little girl’s,
as people said—behind her cheap,
horn-rimmed spectacles.
But Mrs. Tanner never actually
broke down. However sorely her
feelings were tried, she always re¬
tained control of herself. She
simply got very quiet for a mo¬
ment—a moment which was always
very unsettling for her listener—
and then went on in almost, but not
quite, as firm a voice as ever,
making a valiant effort, as every
one could see, to be cheerful
about it. No, she wanted James to
be a good husband above every¬
thing, she said. She wanted him
to be happy. It was what she had
hoped and prayed for: all she asked
of life, now that Mr, Tanner was
—gone. She didn’t intend to inter¬
fere at all. She had seen enough of
that. She wasn’t even going to let
him give her any money, though
he was doing so well at the Works
and could afford it. She wasn’t
going to be a drag on him, a bur¬
den on his wife, in any way. She
intended to take up her sewing
again, which she had dropped when
James had had his first salary
raise, partly on account of her eyes,
and she guessed she’d get along all
right, although it might be hard
working up a clientele again just
at first.
At this point in the conversation
her listeners, their sympathies
tried beyond endurance, generally
reminded her in a delicate way that
Mary Townsend, the girl James"
was marrying, was popularly con¬
sidered one of the most comforta¬
bly fixed girls in town. They
quickly learned that Mrs. Tanner
had taken that into account. It was
just all the more reason, she said,
why she didn’t want to take any
help from James. He would need
all he could get together to keep up
his end, to be the man of the house¬


hold. She had seen some of these
unions between rich girls and poor
poys in her time. Deliver her boy
from anything of that sort! Be¬
sides there was always the danger
the Townsends might think that
she and James had an eye on their
money—not, of course, that the
Townsends were like that. They
were, of course, the nicest, kindest
people in the world, and Mary was
the sweetest, loveliest girl. A mo¬
ther couldn’t wish for a more wo¬
manly little person for her son. But,
well, one couldn’t be too careful,
could one? when so much, when
everything that mattered, in fact,


was at stake.
Usually James was not among
those present when these conversa¬
tions took place. He was down at
the Works, earning some of that
salary which Mrs. Tanner would
never share, or he was calling on
Mary, giving Mrs. Tanner a taste
of the loneliness which was to be
her lot. But once in a while, when
the listener was a lifelong intimate,
like Miss Emily Schroeder, their
neighbor, for example, he was. And
at first he had been heard to de¬
mur as vehemently as the listener
Yes, and more so. But toward the
end, as his wedding day drew clos¬


er, he didn’t. He simply got up and
left the room. He did it rather un¬
graciously, too, without regard
for what his mother’s feelings un-
doubtedly were. And this behavior
tended to clinch the opinion which
many of his mother’s intimates
had always had of him, and which
was not very high.
They remembered, talking him
over, how, as a child with a father
who was simply no good at all and
finally proved it by running away,
his mother had slaved and pinched
to keep him always a little better
dressed than the other boys, and
how ungrateful he had been about
it. Miss Emily Schroeder recalled
that she had once caught him tos¬
sing one of his dear little hats into
her garbage can; and some one else
recalled that she, too, had had an
experience of the kind, although
just what she could no longer re¬
member. It was remembered also
how he had wanted to leave high
school and go to work, and had
even got one of his teachers, who
was one of those new-fangled edu¬
cators and shortly thereafter lost
his position, to intercede for him.
He was just a spoiled ungrateful
young man, they decided, bottling
and labelling once and for all the
suspicions of twenty-five years.
Such behavior now, of all times,
just went to show what he was
and always had been. And then
they added that, of course, there
was his good-for-nothing father—
like father, like son.
Miss Emily Schroeder, who per¬
haps knew him better than any one
else, who had had the opportunity
of observing him all his life and
sat in on the above-mentioned oc¬
casions more often than any one
else, even thought that Mary Town-
send ought to be warned about him.
Love is blind, as every one knows,
and possibly Mary had never seen
him as he actually was, as she must
expect him to be after the first full
flush of lovers’ days had worn off.
Miss Schroeder, however, never
carried out her design. For by the
time she had consulted enough peo¬
ple about it and had got their sig-
natures on her petition, as it were,
Mary Townsend, amazing and dis¬
appointing those who had always
been fond of her, had turned out
to be as unworthy as James her
fiance. From dropping in on Moth-
er Tanner every day, if only for the
fewest of minutes, as she had done
at first, she had stopped visiting
her almost entirely. And there had
been several unpardonable incidents.
She had sent back the gift of a sil¬
ver bowl, which Mother Tanner had
sold her grandmother’s gate-leg ta¬
ble to buy, and this, it was under¬

F we told you (you who are

ask how we got that way, so we are
letting E. Phillips Oppenheim do
the ta king: “Given a certain facil¬

Fascinating storles have been and

don’t we?
HANNING POLLOCK, noted
U American playwright and au¬
thor, claims that the following is
his favorite stary:
"A raw army recruit was mani¬
curing a path at Governor’s Is-
land when a man in uniform passed.
'Hey, buddy,’ the rookie said, 'give
us a light, will you?' The stroller
obliged.
“As he wa’ked away, another sol¬
dier, with staring eyes, exclaimed
to the rookie, 'For the love of M’ke,
do you know who that was? That’s
General Pershing!”
“Flabbergasted, the newcomer
ran after the General. ‘Tm so
sorry, sir,' he apologized. ‘T've only
been in the army a couple of hours,
and I’m afraid all uniforms look
alike to me, sir. I hope you won’t—
"Pershing smiled, and patted the
man on the shoulder. ‘That’s all
right, son. Only— he paused, and
his eyes twinkled, 'only, take my ad¬
vice and never try it on a second
lieutenant.””
And Pollock added: "I’ve cher-
ished that yarn because, looking
back over a 'ong life, I find that
most of my difficulties have been
with second lieutenants.”


To develop fully into real men and women,
children should be subjected to intelligant
discipline.

CCORDING to Paul Popenoe,
A director of the Institute of
Fam’ly Relations in Los Angeles,
men still want their wives dumb.
He said:
“Most men, when seeking wives,
are looking not for executives but
for someone with allure and a wil'-
ingness to fatter their vanity and
make them feel superior. Hence a
woman office manager may be in¬
vited to luncheon, once. But she
quite possibly dishes out warmed-
over remnants of her college course
on 'main currents in contemporary
philosophy,’ and may even insist on
paying her own bill. Result: she
thereafter 'unches alone.
'In contrast, the non-collegiate
typist, when invited to luncheon,
fixes an incandescent gaze on her
escort and says yearningly, ‘Now
tell some more about yourself.' Re¬
sult: he tells other fellows that
"she’s no raving beauty, but I have
never met a better talker.””
Now girls, specially college girls,
now you know why you always ex¬
claim “I can’t imagine him marry¬
ing her!"

To afford proper protection to your children, use Lysol

destroys the dangerous germs that accumulate in floor
cracks and corners. This is not so when using cheap dis¬
infectants. These germs are a threat to the family health
... especially to children, who like to play on the floor
and often put their fingers in their mouths.
Use Lysol at all times for all kinds of house cleaning.
It is so safe and dependable that hospitals all

them like hot-house products:
“"To develop fully, man must face
the inclemencies of the seasons, ex¬
ercise all his muscles, tire himself
out and rest, love and hate, fight
against himself and others. He is
made for this kind of life, as his
stomach is made for digesting va¬
rious foods. And we know how
sound, morally and physically, are
those who have been subject to in¬
telligent discipline from their child-
hood, who know what privations are
and have learned to adjust them¬
selves to adverse conditions.”
Who says so? you who believe in
hot-house children will ask. And
we answer: Only Dr. Alexis Carrel,
surgeon and physiologist, member
of the Rockefe ler Institute, Nobel
Prize winner!
 O not follow this man’s exam¬

be just as good as he or even bet¬

“In Russia, during the Czarist
regime, a cobbler by the name of
Kolesnikof, who had fraudulently
acquired the license and documents
of a deceased Dr. Meski, went into
surgery and actua ly became the
chief surgeon of the Kieff hos¬
pitals. He performed six hundred
major operations with a mortality
percentage which was much lower
than the average. Upon discover¬
ing his identity, Kieff surgeons
were astounded at his record."
EO the members of the National
X Economic Council we respect¬
fully endorse this:
“Since Turkey produced very lit¬
tle for export, there was only one
way to stop the constant flow of
gold from the country and that was


doesn’t.” But should we hate dust,
at least as much as we do? Read:


“Men cherish water or air be¬
cause they know they cannot sur-
vive without them. They do not
cherish dust because they do not
yet know that their water wou'd
not fall as rain without dust nuclei
for the drops; that their air might
be as the breath of a furnace were
(S. C.
it not charged with dust.”
Blacktin, Ph.D., M. Sc.)


After all, man does not know as
much as he thinks, does he? Every
day some mystery is explained,
some secret of nature unraveled.


King Edward VIII: sueceeded the late King George, his father


to build industries of their own.
The absence of private capital and
the impossibility of getting credit
abroad dictated the creation of a
national industry, operated by the
state Turkey organized a Five
Year Plan, beginning it in 1933 and
already achieving splendid results.
“According to it there will be
four textile factories, capable of
supplying Turkey with all her re¬
quirements in cotton-goods. Two
of these are comp'eted. A paper
factory at Iznit began work last
summer. A glass factory is under
construction at Istanbul and a great
artificial silk factory at Gemlik.


Huge factories for the production
of chemical products are planned...
In 1920, with a Greek army in¬
vesting Turkey the country was
ready for dismemberment. Now
Turkey is a very much respected
country.

Testing Body Energy
Subjecting themselves as “hu¬
man guinea pigs” students at Well¬
esley College are making tests to
find the energy quotients of girls
from different parts of the country.
The tests are made on an intri¬
cate series of instruments which
record the various findings on a
moving chart operated by a special
motor. In this way comparisons of
the individual tests can be readily
made.
Findings prove that persons liv¬
ing in a warm climate require only
a fraction of the body energy
needed by those coming from a cold
region. The experiments were sup-
ervised by the college faculty.


EROM the following may be
gleaned the secret which
made the late King George of Eng¬
land so popular and revered a
monarch:


“The secret of life," the King
wrote in a Bible, now in the pos¬
session of Violet Bellamy, London
"is not to do what one likes but to
try to like what one has to do.”
The same idea, more less, but
more elaborate: "Perhaps the most
valuable result of all education is
the ability to make yourself do the
thing you have to do, when it ought
to be done, whether you like it or
not; it is the first lesson that ought
to be learned; and however early a
man’s training begins, it is proba¬
bly the last lesson that he learns
thoroughly.” (T. H. Hurley in The
Nineteenth Century.)


Incidentally, now that we have
a National Council of Education,
how about giving our students
“the ability to make yourself do
the thing you have to do, when it
ought to be done, whether you like
it or not"?

reason underlying the dispute.

Simply "Philippines"
Every foreigner who has visited
our country invariably writes our
country’s name e’ther “Phil ppine
Islands” or “Phi'ippines Island."
American newspapers, books, pam¬
phlets, and magazines use such
phrases as “Natives from the Phil-
ippine Islands,” “headhunters in the
Philippine Islands,” etc. Why not
simply "natives of the Philippines?”
I don’t particularly appreciate the
name "Philippine Islands.” It gives
the people from other countries the
impression that our country is com¬
posed of numerous is’ands, and
whose natives are disintegrated, not
unified in their ideals, culture, and
civilization.
Great Britain, Japan, and Greece,
are each composed of several islands
—yet they do not mention to the
world that they are so composed.

Stabilizing The Pension Fund
How may Act No. 3050 known
as the Teachers’ Pension and Dis¬
ability Fund, be amended so that
the fund will be soundly stabil zed?
Anent this, President Quezon de¬
clared recently, through the press,
that he wanted the opinion of the
pensioners of the teachers' fund.
Well, I am, as former supervising
teacher and present pensioner, sub¬
mitting the fol'owing proposal:
First, to obtain the P45,000.000
needed to stab'lize the pension fund,
a law should be passed authorizing
the P I. President to float bonds
worth P50,000,000. Bonds at P50
and P100, with reasonable rates of
interest, should be sold to residents
of the Philippines and local and for¬
eign banks here. Proceeds from the
sale, together with the pension fund,
should be deposited in a bank from
which all pensions should be drawn.
Second, new teachers should be
made to contribute six per cent, in¬
stead of three, of their salaries to
the teachers’ pension fund. This
is necessary to cover government
contributions to the fund, which

may not be sure after five years.
Third, the minimum teacher’s
service should be 23 years, instead
of 20.
Fourth, any teacher leaving the
service before the completion of the
required 23 years should lose all of
his contributions to the fund.

Going The Way Of Davao
Will Agusan be another Davao
and present herself, some day, as
a national prob'em?
Outward signs, so it seems are
pointing defin tely to an affirma¬
tive answer. There are now many
Japanese in Agusan, and their


number is steadily increasing. Sev¬
eral have opened merchandise
stores, and the articles sold are
manufactured in Japan.
There is a bicycle dea’er here
and he has made a flying start.
Somehow, despite the NEPA, he is
making greater sales than the
native stores. In a bicycle race he
conducted, he awarded prizes to
the winners. Isn’t that attracting
business?
Aside from the proverbial Japan¬
ese candy and refreshment stores,
there are now lumber firms man¬
aged by the enterprising people
from the land of the rising sun.
Eventually perhaps, I regret to say,
they will control the volume of
business here.

Two Sonnets


WHEN I am gone—and I shall go before you—
Think of me not as your disconsolate lover;
Think of the joy it gave me to adore you,
Of sun and stars you helped me to discover.
And if at night in dreams my spirit hovers
And shadows of the memoried past enfold you,
A merry ghost will sit upon the covers
And tell again some flippant tale I told you;
Will sing again some long-forgotten song,
Some artless, tender rhyme I wrote about you,
When moments spent with you made sweet the long,
Slow, desolate days and nights I lived without you.
Then all on earth that Death has left behind
Will be the merry part of me within your mind.
II
MY face, before the turn of many years,
Will be as brown and wrinkled as old leather,
With ruts of passion, furrows worn by tears,
And seams of ribald laughter close together.
The voice with which I sang to you of love
Wi'l croak and squeak, and children laugh to hear it;
And these straight limbs, that once I boasted of,
Trembling will seek the fire and chain me near it.
My eyes that, from the foremasthead, at dawn,
Have swept the burnished seas and fading stars,
Gaze inward now at things forever gone
That once were aching wounds—now shrunken scars.
But in the withered spirit, none the less,
A melody will sing your loveliness.

we be alwavs g’ad to have a Jan¬

Offer If By Correspondence
Dean Bienvenido Gonzales, of
the U.P college of agricu’ture, has
announced that the college will of-
fer extension courses this summer.
The courses, he said, are designed
for people who are interested in
studving special agricultural phases
but have no time to do so. Perhaps,
he a’so means persons who do not
have the money to get a complete
course at the col'ege.
The trouble with his plan is that
the prospective students, who may
be actual farmers, will be forced
to go to Los Banos, just to take up
a summer course in poultry rais¬
ing, hog breeding, or backyard gar¬
dening. To a man of small means,
the extension course is impractical
in that if he hails from Tocos or
from the Visayan provinces, he sim¬
ply cannot avail himself of the tech-
nical knowledge that Dean Gonza-
les aims to give this coming sum¬
mer.
Here is a good suggestion, how¬
ever. Why doesn’t he give those
extension courses by correspond-
ence? Some American universities
give farm courses that way. To
send the lessons by mail would
mean educating a great many who
cannot go to Los Banos for pecu¬
niary reasons. Boarding house ex¬
penses will be done away w'th, and
they have also the advantage of
lookng after their farm interests
regularly whi'e studying. Which
they cannot do if they trek to Los
Banos and stay there for three
months.

A Housewife Goe


To The


OST of those who went to
see this year’s Manila car¬
LA nival ahead of us told us
that they did not notice anything
man  the third acricul¬


WE 
now had we not gone to see the ca¬
position in company of a housewife
who is intensely interested in her
home, in her small flower garden,
and in cooking. Her contaminat¬
ing enthusiasm for everything may
have been due to the fact that she
came from the province and that
it was the first agricultural, in¬
dustrial, and commercial exposi¬
tion that she was seeing, but she
made us see the usefulness, to her
as a housewife, at least, of many
details that the average visitor to
the exposition did not notice. For
instance, the average visitor in all
probability saw the attractive
flower beds near the entrance as
mere decorations; even the bu¬
reau of plant industry perhaps in¬
tended these flower beds to be just
that—decoration, but our house¬
wife companion saw them as mo¬
dels of fower beds that she could
make in her garden.
The next to attract her atten¬
tion was the window treatment in
the dining room displayed by the
bureau of commerce and industry.
“I must do over my dining room
window like that!” she exclaimed.
Novel Window Treatment
If you have a window or several
windows in your house which need
dressing up a bit because they are
so plain and unattractive, here is
a model by Edades, the well¬
known mural painter. The drapery
which falls in graceful folds
down to the floor is of pinokpok.
(Ilocano cloth may be used in¬

hitchen displayed at the agricultural, in¬
dustrial, and commercial expasition has
an attached staal, cabinet, and extensian
board.

stead.) The draperies, each con¬
sisting of only one width, were
tucked in fo ds at the top of the
window and allowed to fall
straight to the floor. If desired,
 onitaina may he hung on a rod
rge us


miol-
flowers, for vines or for hanging
plants, such as asparagus ferns.
Creating Space
What interested most people in
the hacendero’s house were the
NEPA furnishing and decorations,
but the arrangement of the fur-
niture which is responsible to a
great extent for the illusion of
spaciousness throughout the small
house was what attracted the


housewife’s attention first. Imme¬
diately she started to analyze the
living room and discovered three
reasons for that appearance of
spaciousness prevai ing in it:
first, the size of the furniture is
suitable to the size of the room;
second, only the essential pieces
have been placed in the room;
third, the furniture has been
arranged against the walls, leav¬
ing the center of the room empty
and thus allowing an unobstructed
passage from porch to the dining
room or to any of the bedrooms.
The sofa which is the largest and
most important piece of furniture
in the room was placed against the
widest wall. In one corner was
placed an armchair with table to


Window treatment by Edades, well-
 mural painter in Manila. The
 chade or


ment may be copied in an .
with any set of furniture. The
important point is to create an
empty space in the center of the
room in order not to obstruct traf¬
fic.
Kitchen Table Goes Modern
“I would love to have such a
tab'e if I could only afford it,” she
sighed as she saw the kitchen


table in the kitchen displayed by
the bureau of commerce and in¬
dustry. The table referred to is
very much like an office desk,
with drawers and an attached
stool, much like a piano stool,
which may be turned in under the
table when not in use so as to be
out of the way.
Recipe Contest
A large crowd of women in the
enclosure where the bureau of
plant industry served refresh¬
ments attracted our attention. The
reason was the first recipe contest
sponsored by the bureau of plant
industry for the purpose of pop¬
ularizing the use of cassava flour,
arrowroot starch, and ubi delight


(powder). Ten schools, colleges,
and individuals participated in the
contest and submitted more than
two hundred recipes. The entries
presented by the contestants
showed conclusively that cassava
flour may be successfully used,
pure or in combination with wheat
flour, for the preparation of
cakes, cookies, biscuits, breads,
and pastries. Unfortunately, our
housewife had not heard of the
contest; if she had, she would have
entered and submitted her recipes.
She had heard of cassava flour,
she said, but she did not know
where to get some. For her in-
formation, one of the men in
charge of the contest explained
to her that cassava flour, arrow¬

booth of the bureau. We went
there and purchased a booklet and
also tried the ubi delight ice
cream, cassava cake and ensat¬
mada, and some polvoron, which
the bureau served in its canteen.
Mango Catchup
Making our way through the
crowd of women viewing the deli¬
cious-looking cakes, cookies, and
other dainties, we overheard a
woman tell another of the mango
catchup on sale in the refreshment
canteen of the department of home
economics of the bureau of science.
Of course we had to go there and
purchase a bottle each. We do
not like tomato catchup much, and
we do like the mango catchup bet¬
ter. It is especially nice served with
broiled or fried pork chops or fish
and fritters.

A contest, sponsored by the
Root Crop Utilization And Cassa¬
va Industrial Laboratory of the
bureau of plant industry in con¬
nection with the third annual
agricultural, commercia', and in¬
dustrial exposition at the Manila
1936 carnival. The purpose of the
contest was to popularize the use
of cassava, arrowroot, and ubi
flours; which are now being ma¬
nufactured and sold by the bu¬
reau.
Gollorias
1 cup cassava flour
1 cup wheat flour


4 teaspoons baking powder
Me teaspoon salt
143 cup mi.k
egg
3 tablespoons melted butter or
I teaspoon vanilla
Sift all the dry ingredients to¬
gether. Add the egg which has
been beaten with the milk and the
melted butter. Mix thoroughly
and add enough flour to knead
the dough smoothly. Roll out the
dough to about one and one-third
inch thick on a floured board and
cut into strips about one inch
wide each. Divide the strips into
tiny portions and roll each portion
with your thumb on a golloria pad


or on the tines of a fork until it
forms a spiral shell. Fry the
gollorias in deep hot fat. Drain
and then drop into a thick syrup.
When sufficiently coated, remove
from the syrup, and dry out in the
sunshine.—Centro Escolar Univer¬
sity, home economics division.
The syrup is made by boiling 3
cups of water and 1 cup of sugar.
The home economics depart-
ment of the Philippine Normal
School used 2 cups of cassava flour
instead of one cup of cassava flour
and one cup of wheat flour in the
above recipe and achieved the
same result.
Here is a richer recipe for gollo¬
rias:
1 cup cassava flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1-Lz teaspoons butter
2 egg yoks
teaspoon sugar
Enough water to moisten
Sift the dry ingredients twice
and work in the butter. Add the
egg yolks and enough water or
milk to moisten so that a soft
dough is formed. Proceed as in
the above recipe.—University of
Santo Tomas, home economics de¬
partment.
Polvoron
3 cups cassava flour
 cup butter
1-143 cups sugar
Toast the cassava flour; cream
the butter and the sugar thor-
oughly. Add the cassava flour,

piece in paper.—Centro Escolar
University, home economics depart¬
ment.
Cassava Churros
2 cups cassava flour


2, teaspoons salt
2 eggs yolks
1-143 cups water
Boil the salt and the water to¬
gether. Sift the cassava flour
once and then pour into the boil¬
ing water, stirring all the time
with a wooden spoon. Remove the
pan from the fire and add the un¬
beaten eggs one by one, working
them well into the batter. Put the
mixture into a cake decorator or
a Manila paper cornucopia and
press out desired lengths into hot,
deep fat. When brown, drain
from lard, and serve with fine
sugar.—Philippine Women's Univer¬
sity, research bureau.
Cassava Polvoron Imperial
3 cups cassava flour
3 cups granulated sugar
L pound (1 cup) butter
Toast the cassava flour till light
brown. Add the sugar, then the
butter. Mix well until the butter
has been thoroughly mixed with
the flour. Mold and wrap in
paper.—Instituto de Mujeres, home
economics department.
Cassava Suman
1 can condensed milk
2 cups cassava flour
2 cups coconut milk
1 cup sugar
Mix all the ingredients and stir
till all lumps disappear. Cook
over a low fire till thick enough
to mold. Heat banana leaves over
the fire and cut into wide square
pieces. Wrap a small portion of
the mixture in a piece of banana
leaf and roll into a cylindrical
form. Tie the rolls by pairs and

How To Grow Seedlings Successfully
In Spite Of The Hot Weather


cover the seeds with soil and press
the surface of the soil firmly.
Place the boxes in shallow water
until the surface becomes moist.
Place the boxes on the sill of a
southeast or west window to drain,
and cover them with a piece of
newspaper to prevent the rapid
evaporation of the moisture from
the soil. Keep the soil moist but
not wet.
When the seedlings appear, re¬
move the newspaper cover and
turn the boxes around daily to pre¬
vent the seed ings’ "drawing" to¬
ward the light. Do not allow the
hot sun to shine on them. When
the second pair of true leaves ap¬
pear on each seedling, transplant
the seedlings into larger flats or
small pots. Then plunge the flats
or the pots, rim deep, into sifted
ashes or sand to check drying of


The housewife who is interested
in gardening should have learned
a lesson or two in planting from
them. As one of the men of the
bureau of plant industry pointed
out to us, flowering plants like zin¬
nias, cosmos, phlox, petunias, and
others show their blooms to the
best advantage when they are
planted in mass or in groups, in¬
stead of in a single row or in pots.
Another lesson in gardening or ra¬
ther in flower bed making that
the housewife interested in plants
could have learned from the
flower beds at the exposition is the
arrangement of the plants. When
plants are planted in beds or in
mass they should be arranged ac¬
cording to their respective heights
as well as colors so that they will
present a pleasing effect when in
bloom. Thus, in the flower beds at
the exposition, the cosmos which
are the tallest of the plants, were
planted in the center. Next to them
were planted the zinnias, followec
by the phloxes, which are the short-
est of all. The double border of
each bed consisted of red- and
green-leaved cucharitas.
Gardens, says Grace Tabor, gar¬
dening editor of the Woman's
Home Companion, are precisely
like rooms in a house, as far as
their furnis!
i- concerned. The

tial it is t

Shallow cigar boxes made good
seed pans” for starting seedlings.
Prepare the empty cigar boxes
in this manner: Bore small holes
in the bottom of each cigar box
and cover the bottom with a layer
of drainage materials, such as, bits
of broken pots, cinder, small
stones. Then fill the box with
crumbly, not very rich soil, which
has been well-sifted. Pack down
and level with a flat block of
wood, make lines for the seeds,
and sow the seeds thinly. Barely


vine which was planted last December,


the soil. Keep the soil moist but
not wet. When the roots of the
seedlings begin to "mat,” the
seedlings are ready to be trans¬
planted. You will find out that
the earth around the roots of each
plant has formed into a ball. This
makes it easier for you to trans¬
plant the seedlings. With your
hands or with a small shovel, re¬
move each plant from the pot or
flat, taking care not to break the
ball of earth or break the roots,
and place it into a hollow in the


flower bed which has been pre¬
viously prepared.

Schoolgir
Technique


LL you budding y oung
schoolgirls, this is for you.
A when it comes to the
question of beauty, each one of
you is apt to be a pretty misin¬
formed and misunderstood young
lady. Fond parents have a way
of thinking that you are beautiful
enough as you are, that a school¬
girl’s complexion is a gift of the
gods and nothing need be done
about it. As if any one ever could
be young enough to start laying
the foundation for a good clear
skin. For it is the way we care
for our faces that makes them
what they are when we are grown-
up.
First and foremost, you should
learn to keep your face c'ean. You
think, perhaps, that this is just as
easy as eating pie, but it is not.
First, you must have a cake of good
soap, not necessarily an expensive
one, and a wash-cloth. Rinse the
face with lukewarm water, then
scrub it well with the wash-cloth
on which a little soap has been
rubbed. Rinse off all the soap with
the warm water, then splash with
cold water to close the pores. If
this procedure is fo'lowed reli¬
giously every evening or morning,
much of the blackheads and other


This schoolgirl affects a very simple
coiffure that is suitable to her age.


blemishes that crop up in the early
'teens can be prevented.
If bumps and blemishes do crop
up, give them time, and they will
go away. Do not worry much about
them. Do not press them out, great
as your temptation might be, for
you might make the condition
worse. In the meantime you can
do something to help drive them
away. More often than not, they
are caused by the improper func-
tiening of your glandu'ar system.
First, keep the skin entirely clean
cutside by the method of cleansing
the face described above. Then see
to it that your diet is proper. Drink
p'enty of water (at least eight
g'asses every day to help cleanse
the system), eat plenty of fruits
and vegetables, exercise or take
long hikes in the open air, and
sleep at least nine hours every
night. Cut off too much sweets
and heavy foods, especially fried
ones.
Whatever the weather, make it a
practice to take a bath every day
with plenty of soaping. Brush your
teeth at least before going to bed,
better still, after each meal; keep
the nails and the hands clean;
shampoo the hair when it needs
washing; evacuate regularly; and
practice good posture. You should
wa’k and stand erect, shoulders
back and abdomen flat, all without
effort or strain. Remember to sit
with your back straight against the
back of the desk and with your feet
flat on the floor when you are in
the schoolrcom.
And now, what about make-up?
That’s where the battle between
mothers and young daughters lies.
Many a girl whose face is s'ath-
ered thick w'th conspicuous rouge
and lipstick, who totters around or
high heels, and wears the most
daring of evening dresses or the
most frilly of school dresses is not
as chic as she thinks she is. As a


Keeping the face clean helps prevent
blemishes. That “serubbed with water
and soap” looh of the face is now the
vague, even among the most sophisticated.
matter of fact, she is behind the
times, a little out of date. For the
very sophisticated world is now go¬
ing in for a different type of beauty
—a clean-scrubbed, healthy, natural
sort. Many a wordly young woman
is wiping off her powder and rouge
and putting vase ine on her face to
make it shine—trying to imitate
the schoolgirl’s shiny face, which
you don’t like at all.
Powder, yes, may be used by the
schoolgirl, but the kind that con¬
tains talc, such as a baby uses, and
not the kind that c'ogs the pores
and cakes on the face when you
perspire.
Rouge is something that is very
different from powder, and any
girl under eighteen who puts rouge
on her cheeks is making the mis¬
take of her life. In the first place,
she entirely kills her own pretty
and natural coloring. Then, no
ene with a conscience can honestly
say that rouge is good for the skin.
Thirdly, rouge is put on to create
an illusion of youth—and school¬
girls have it. Lipstick is likely to


rob your lips of their own color,
too, but if life seems unbearable to
you without it, do choose a natu¬
ral shade. The bright ones only
make you look hard. Vaseline is
good not only for the eyelashes and
eyebrows to make them grow, but
also for the lips to keep them soft.
If you must trim your eyebrows,
do it discreetly. It is no longer
smart to thin out the eyebrows to
mere lines. Even movie stars no
longer do this. What you should
do is to train your eyebrows into
beautiful archs by brushing them
every night.
One thing that is hard to get
without through life, when your
fairy godmother forgot to give
you curly hair, is a permanent
wave. However, if you cannot af¬
ford it, be content, for the most
straight hair can now be arranged
most becomingly to please the most
fastidious schoolgirls. Many girls
now braid their long hair and wind
the braid around their head like a
coronet with the most charming
effect. When you get tired of this
arrangement, try arranging the
braid like a topknot at the nape
of the neck.
The way you wear your hair is
pretty much up to you. No one
wants anything fussy or involved
these days. Something soft and
simple that you can fix in place
with one lick of the comb or brush
is the aim of even the most so¬
phisticated. Combing the hair back
of your ears seems to be more dis¬
tinctive at the moment.


If you will follow these general
rules for personal hygiene and
health, you will not have to worry
about your looks: Breathe deeply.
Exercise regularly or take long
hikes in the open air. Practise cor¬
rect posture. Eat a balanced diet
containing plenty of fruits and ve¬
getables. Drink at least eight glas¬
ses of water and two cups of milk
each day. Evacuate regularly. Stu¬
dy and sleep in well ventilated
rooms. Wear loose and porous
clothing. Brush your teeth two or
three times a day. Keep the nails
and the hands clean. Take a bath
daily to keep the body clean.—Dr.
Adelaide Smith.

so he said, until they were about to
be lawyers.
We fear and respect men of stern
character. Children have the same
feelings for silent and stern par¬
ents. But how much do children
love them?
Obedience should flower from
love and affection, never from fear.
A child cannot develop tenderness
of feeling for a father at whose
frown and stern vo.ce he imme¬
diate,y loses his young wits. Con¬
stant sternness in a father develops
in a child an attitude that renders
further severity necessary.
Judge Albert, in the same art¬
icle, says he has never found occa¬
sion to whip his children. Which
expla ns why we are not mistaken
in our admiration for Miss Maria
Martha A.bert. The pure quality
of the offspring is what is to be ex¬
pected from a man so pleasing and
gentle, straight but not stern.
If Judge Albert has brought up
his children properly without the
aid of the rod, and Justice Diaz
achieved the same results with the
promiscuous use of one, I do not
know if we shall ever hesitate to
use that method of child-training
which dispenses with force and
physical suffering.
Corporal punishment is injurious
to children especially. Too much
use of the rod turns a child cow¬
ardly or vindictively temperament¬
al or neurotic. Frequently, affec¬
tion for parents disappears.
There have been times when the
writer’s mind cannot be ruffled
even by a knife pointed close to his
throat, and times when the fall of
a pin startled him. Why? Because
of an effect of early conditioning.
The coward in me was created by


the ear’y violence to which I was
subjected.

Dismiss Them
Patrolman Maximo Turla, for
accepting a bribe from a couple
whom he surprised necking, found
himself suspended from the force.
He now faces, I kewise, a criminal
complaint for the same offense.
That, however, is not the only
case of its kind. So many young
people, especial'y those who go to
the Manila beaches, have been in¬
sistently annoyed by racketeering
letectives and policemen. They
were always accused of necking, in¬
decency in a publ’c place, and
threatened with being booked for
the offense at the Luneta police
station.
And yet, they never reach the
police station. Innocent, the police¬
man or the detective suggests an
arreglo, and the young man—will¬
ingly enough—pays the amount
asked, just to shie d the girl’s name
from publicity.
There was even the case of a
young couple whom a policeman
could not bluff into giving him a
oribe, simply because the young
man did not have any money at the
time. The young man was willing
to come along to the station, so
with the girl. But the policeman,
hinking that he might as well look
for a couple with money, allowed
them to go home.
I hope Colonel Antonio Torres, as
new chief of police, will do some¬
thing to eradicate this evil among
some of his men who would secure


doub'e compensation at the expense
of young peop.e.

MORNING CALM
THIS morning the sea is calm
And stid;
An immaculate sheet of pale gray-blue,
It spreads its level plane
To the line of sky.
The fisheiman’s lunday smoothly
Glides over the lovely surface
And writes strange jewelled letfers
On the burnished
Water.
Last night the storm was strong
And the rain ran tripping
On its finy feet through the grass blades....
This morning the sea is calm,
For peece follows storm
And darkness flees before the beautiful
Dawn.

PERDITION GOES ON

Continued from page s
waiting to be shipped to Manila.
I talked to one of the fiften and
she told me the agent had in¬
formed them they were going to
work in a bunch. They did not
know that once in Manila they
would be distributed to several
people—if they were lucky to find
anybody to get them atronce. Whhe
waiting for somebody to empley
them, they eat at the expense of
the agent, who charges to their
account, without their knowledge,
any amount he wants to.
Does Not Receive Salary
When the girl is employed, she
finds that the job is not as soft as
it had been pictured. And when
she asks for her salary, her mas¬
ter tells her that he could not give
her any money until after some
two years because she owed him
the equivalent of that salary.
The girl is surprised and ex¬
plains that she has not borrowed
any money from him. Whereupon
the master tells her that the agent
took that amount from him for her
subsistence in the city and for her
parents. The truth is that the
gir’s parents probably never re¬
ceived a centavo of what had been
given to the agent by the master.
At the time of writing, I had a
brief talk with a girl who stopped
in front of our house. She was a
good-looking girl and came from
one of the barrios of the town.
When the sub-agent accompanying
her was out of hearing, I asked
her where she was going and she
said she was going to Manila to
be taken by a relative of hers
there. Hastily I explained to her
that she probably would not reach
her relative at all, and told her
instances of girls being lost in the
city. She did not listen to me.
The picture painted for her be¬
nefit by the agent was too vividly
beautiful to be fogged by a mere
warning.


Ir the agent cannot succeed in
convincing the parents, he resorts
to perauading the girl to run away
from ' me. Sometimes the agent
hides ner before she is shipped to
Mani a. I know an instance in
which a girl engaged to be mar¬
ried was lured away by some slick
agents. They put rosy ideas in her
head, and me day she disappeared.
Recently, while visiting a friend
in Malate, Manila, I was surprised
to find there a girl who knew me.
After a short investigation, I dis¬
covered that she was a relative of
mine. She told me she had stayed
with an American family for two
years without receiving any sal¬
ary, for the agant had taken the
amount corresp-mding to what was
due her for that period.
She wept as she related further
her life in the city. She had tried
to escape, she sai-l, but was afraid
she might get lost in the city. She
said she was eager to see her child
scarcely 11 months old when she
left—and was pining to see him.
To cabarets in the sity and the


surrounding provinces go many of
these unfortunate victims to earn
a living after they have left their
masters. Those who are more des¬
perate and who want to earn
easier money join the legion of
women of easy virtue.
The Guinobatan Rural High
School led the campaign against
this victimizing of unsuspecting
girls as far back as 1933. But
gullible families and girls are still
falling for the promises of the
voluble agent and sub-agent.

“COLORFUL" CITIZENS OF...

provised platform. There he is
entertained, otherwise he would
emu ate the speaker’s eloquence
with an oratory all his own, and
much to the former’s embarrass¬
ment, notwithstanding the annoy¬
ance of the crowd. In parties he
is served first, lest he annoy those
present. In a wager, he is consi¬
dered a winner even before the
game is played.
He was at the height of his lo¬
quacity in a barber shop one day
when I chanced upon him. He
rumbled and defied and gesticu¬
lated. Then, abruptly, he subsided
with a plea. He was asking the
barber for a 5-centavo piece with
which to buy a drink. He turned
his pockets inside out to prove
that he was really penniless. After
a few moments of his entreaties,
he got what he wanted.
At that instant, a beggar showed
up at the shop. Marikokut, with-
out any provocation, faced the
frail old man and shouted: "What
do you want here? Get out of here
before I squeeze your neck. Get
out!”
“Alms, sir,” the beggar sup-
plicated.
"Alms, sir!” Marikokut mocked.
nd he reproached the mendicant
ta begging. In his drunken way,
he hegan counting on his finger
tin the reasons why the beggar


should not go around begging.
Through with the enumeration, he
vociferated again: “Get out of
here before I squeeze your neck!”
The frightened beggar backed
out but he had hardly moved a
step when he saw Marikokut mo¬
tioning him to stop. The drunk¬
ard took his 5-centavo piece from
his pocket, shoved it into the palm
of the beggar, and said: "Now you
can go.” The deed done, he slowly
turned to us and whispered, "No
wine to-day."

BIG PLANS FOR

Secretary of the Interior. Provin-

the director and the Secretary on
official matters concerning the spe¬
cial provinces. The work of the bu¬
reau can be easily performed with
the same efficiency by a division of
the Department of the Interior, it
is believed.
Furthermore, many of the prov¬
inces under the bureau are clamor¬
ing for their regular status. As at
matter of fact, the assemblymen
for Zamboanga and Davao have al¬
ready filed a bill seeking for the
conversion of Davao and Zamboan¬
ga into regular provinces. The as¬
semblymen for other special provin¬
ces are also planning to do the
same. If this happens, the bureau
of non-Christian tribes will auto¬
matically cease from supervising
the said provinces, which will then
come directly under the Secretary
of the Interior.

QUESTION:—A and B, husband
and wife, respectively have been
separated for nearly two years now
A has not been pre en guilty of any
marital wrong-doing, both extra¬
judicially and nadicially. In this es¬
tranged relation, two of their three
children are in A’s care and the
remaining one is in B’s care. Now
B wants to have the custody of all
the children. But A wants to keep
the two or all of them in his care.
What does the law of the Philip-
pines say about the custody of chil¬
tiren?—Pedro M. Labata, Maasin,
Leyte.
ANSWER:—B cannot have the
custody of a’l the children; and
only A and B as husband and
/wife, can keep the children. No
court action, and no law likewise,
will grant B the custody of all the
children thus depriving A of them.
REASON: A and B are not di¬
vorced, nor is there any desire by
either one to file a suit for divorce.
Neither is anyone absent, thus ne¬
cessitating either one of them to
be given the custody of all the chil¬
dren.

There being no litigation for
adultery or divorce, nor a declara¬
tion of absence of one of the
spouses, the law presumes that the
parties are living together. The
law now does not sanction partial
separation of the spouses.
Had there been a divorce pro¬
ceeding, the law, by virtue of Sec.
7, Act. No. 2710, known as the
divorce law, will require that
"during the pendency of divorce
proceedings the court shall make
provision for the care of the minor
children, in accordance with the
circumstances and...; but the
court shall abstain from making
any order in this respect in case
the parents have, by mutual agree¬
ment, made provision for the care
of said minor children and these
are, in the judgment of the court,
well cared for.”
In case there has been a divorce
decree, the minor children shall
remain in the custody of the inno
cent spouse un'ess otherwise di¬
rected by the court in the interest
of said minors, for whom said
court may appoint a guardian.
For B to demand the custody of
all the children, she must resort to
court action, showing why A shou d
not keep any or all of the children.
But we sincerely doubt whether
the action will prosper in the
covrts of 'aw.—Answered by Atty.

QUESTIONS:—What is the for¬

similar preparations is given in the

York. This book may be obtained

MCTHER TANNER

stood, with James’s approval. She
had even been silent when some one
praised Mrs. Tanner’s character in
her presence. And she had never
once suggested that Mother Tanner
help choose her trousseau.
But if any one expected Mrs.


Tanner to complain of this treat¬
ment, he was sadly mistaken. She
never said a word. She never, in¬
deed, gave any hint that she noticec
it. If anything, her public opinion
of Mary grew higher. She could
never get enough of talking about
her, it seemed, and as time went
on it was all people like Miss Emily
who knew could manage to listen
in silence. If it had not been for
the fact that Mrs. Tanner was talk¬
ing only to bolster her feelings (as
could be told by something indef-
inable in her manner) they would
certainly have had to speak out
their minds.
And meanwhile the weeks were
coming and going, the wedding day
was drawing closer and closer.
N the day before the wedding
Mrs. Townsend’s sister—Aun¬
tie Christine, as Mrs. Tanner had
already, bravely, began to call her
—gave a luncheon. It was to be just
a little family affair, and, of
course, Mrs. Tanner was asked. And
she was so happy about it, so
pleased; as if, Miss Schroeder re-
marked, she hadn’t expected it....
as if she wasn’t worth the lot of
them, they and their bank accounts
put together!
She was up at dawn ¡that day.
James claimed to have’ heard her
since six, and when he finally came
downstairs he found her busy over
her wash tubs, with a morning’s
work half finished.
"Why, what on earth are you do¬
ing, mother?” he asked, just as
though, Miss Schoeder went on, he
didn’t know she had been killing
herself all week, getting his things
ready, and she with her heart the
wvay it was! And when she an¬
swered, instead of being grateful,
he flew into a rage. He raved and
ranted, reported Miss Schroeder
saying how he, had told his mothel
over and over' again to send his
clothes to the laundry. And she
just standing; there, trying to smile,
and not even answering! When he
had finally stopped and left for
work, she had merely taken off her
glasses, wiped them shakily on her
apron and said: “Poor boy, he’s so
unnerved....."
But she, too, was unnerved, Miss
Schroeder saw. She was pale, there
were lines around her mouth, and
her hands were shaking visibly. She
had not looked well all week, and
Miss Schroeder was worried. She
had determined there and then,
Miss Schroeder said later, to stay
with Mother Tanner until that
morning was over.
And stay she had, while Mother
Tanner washed and while she
ironed, while she beat up a cake
ghe wanted to take to the Town-
sends, and while she cleaned the
rooms and made the beds. (She
had always refused to have a maid
in the house; it wasn’t right, she
had always said, to use all James’s
money on the housekeeping.) Miss
Schroeder even stood by while she
dressed, and afterward sat with her
in the front window, waiting for
James to come home early, as had


been arranged, and drive her to
the Townsends.
And it was there, in the parlor,
waiting for James, that Mother
Tanner had said the only words
against Mary that any one had
ever heard. It had been so little—
scarcely a criticism at all—that
Miss Schroeder would never have
remembered it, if there had ever
been anything else. She had mere¬
ly remarked in passing how little
Mary thought about clothes. “She
has always had so many, you
know,” she had said, “that she has
never really had to think about
them. I do hope James will realize
that and be patient....”
So the morning had passed. And
finally it was noon, and James had
not arrived. Mother Tanner had
been growing more and more ner¬
vous with every passing minute.
And finally, at five minutes after
twelve, she rose.
“James has forgotten me or been
delayed," she said. "Td better
start.
“Oh, no!” Miss Schroeder replied.
“You mustn’t do that. Why, it’s
miles!"
“Not miles, Emily,” Mrs. Tanner
said, smiling that sweet, sad smile.
“When James was little I used to
traipse all the way out to Point-of-
Pines with my sewing. I guess I
am still young enough to walk
thirteen city blocks.”
And regarding her, Miss Schro-
eder had known there was no use
arguing.
“Very well," she said, rising. “I
shall walk with you.” (“I could have
beaten that boy,” she added when
she repeated the story.)
And so they had started, Miss
Schroeder holding on to Mother
Tanner’s arm and guiding her
step, which was more faltering
than she had noticed it to be be¬
fore. It took them fifteen minutes
to go four blocks, and Miss Schro¬
eder was in no way surprised when,
at the corner of Seventh and Elm
Streets, Mother Tanner suddenly
said, "I can go no further," and be¬
gan to weep, sagging over on Miss
Schroeder’s shoulder.
“I just kept my head, I don’t know
how,” Miss Schroeder said, talking
about it later, "and hailed a cab. I
can’t say how I got her into it, for
by that time she was already un¬
conscious. But I did. I managed it
somehow.... Oh, that boy will
pay in the hereafter for the way
he’s treated his mother!”
They arrived back home just as
James, nearly distracted, he said,
(though some, as Miss Schroeder
told him, might think different)
drew up in the car. He had been
searching all over town for them,
he said, and called the Townsends
finally and not finding them there,
had given up and returned. He car¬
ried his mother into the house,
while Miss Schroeder telephoned
for the doctor.
And when the doctor came and
told them that, although Mother
Tanner would recover, she had

NE of the nice things about
staying in a Baguio hotel is
O that it gives you the oppor¬
tunity to see honeymooners. How
delightful it is to see couples while
the glow and glamour of romance
have not yet been rubbed out from
their eyes, while their every gesture
towards each other is still, for-
sooth, a beau geste! How delight-
ful—and saddening. Saddening,
because as you watch them, you
feel like the sadly wise wedding
guests in Katharine Brush’s "Young
Man of Manhattan": you try to
tell yourself that the twain look so
right, so beautiful, together that
it will last; but deep in your heart
you know that it won’t—in all pro¬
bability, at any rate. For few are
the lovers, in or out of wedlock,
who—like the Brownings and the
Patmores—do "live happily ever
after."
APROPOS of that: two of those
who help to run this hotel are a gay
and companionable young man and
a decidedly presentable young lady.
And the latter, who has been wit-
nessing “Grand Hotel" happenings
for around eight years now, told
me something on which bachelors
might well ponder, especially in a
leap year such as this.
It has been her observation, she
said, that when a man and a woman
are on their honeymoon, it is the
former who settles the accounts.
But when the same couple come
again—quite some time after the
honeymoon era, of course—it is the
better half who pays the bills. 'Nuff
sed.
INCIDENTALLY: the enlighten¬
ing young lady’s nickname is Nan¬
cy. This is derived from Encarna¬
cion. Ingenious, what?
But not NEPA, you might object.
Vell, und for vy not? Many of the
NEPA nicknames are so unkind to
the ear! Consider:
Among the girls I know are Ro¬
salina, Leonor. Corazon, Ligaya,
Lualhati, and Damasa; and their
respective nicknames are Sally,
Nelly, Rosy, Gay, Hattie, and Dai¬
sy. Americanized or Anglified, but
what of it? Nancy, Sally, Nelly,
Rosy, Gay, Hattie, and Daisy sound
better, you will agree, than—say—
Cion, Osang, Anong, Orang, Ga¬
yang, Ating, and Masa! And al¬
though a rose by any other name
would smell as sweet, you wouldn’t
find it mentioned so frequently in
song, sonnet, and story if it were
called Kantutay instead....
SPEAKING of sounds that are
music to the ear: the other night,
I heard some—over the wire. They
were as sweet as song to me, not
because they were the words and
tones of any particular girl but be¬


cause they came all the way from
Manila. Yep, 'twas a long-distance
call.
It seems, you see, that one of my
friends was in the carnival and got
into a place where she was told that
she could make a long-distance call
for nothing. "And so,” she told me,
"I thought I’d call you up. How
are you, AE, how are you?”
Fine, I said, perfectly fine. How
could any one feel otherwise under
the circumstances? Or if one re¬
ceives, from a young lady 'way
down in the Visayas, an elegant
card on which these words are
printed:
Im sorry you've been under cover
For such a long time,—but Gee!
The news that your ills are most
over
Sounds awfully good to me!
Or if, on the occasion of Valentine
Day, one receives half a dozen or so
greetings, four totally unexpected,
one partly a surprise, and two con¬
tained in letters covering no less
than twenty pages of ordinary-sized
stationery?
Really, with such words, it takes
no effort to echo heartily what the
hero of Harry Leon Wilson’s “Oh,
Doctor!” ejaculated fervently when
he, too, was recovering: "It’s good
to be alive!”

nearly had a stroke and must have
no excitement, James had done the
only thing he could have done, so
that Miss Emily Schroeder could
not think better of him even for


that. He had telephoned Mary, and
after a half-hour’s talk and an in¬
terview later that afternoon, they
had decided to postpone the wed-
ding.
It was wonderful, Miss Schroe¬

she heard it, did not appear to af

WINGS FOR THE P. I. ARMY
Contimued from page 14


is not allowed to continue the eight-
month course.
“Our class of more than 135 was
divided into two sections. One
went up from 8 to 10 and the oth¬
er from 10 to 12 in the morning.
Each army instructor was assigned
four, sometimes five, flying stu¬
dents. Five days after our section
had been made up, we went up for
our first flying trip. Our section,
I guess, used some sixty planes. We
looked like bees droning in the
skies.”
Remaining up, recounted Lt. Lu¬
na, was exciting. There was the
constant roar of the motors, and
the happy fortune of handling the
modern airplanes. He had, while up
among the winter clouds at 4,000
feet, sudden thoughts of a crack-
up. But he finally drove the
thoughts away, and did his flying
with extreme precaution.
Flew Five Days a Week
Every morning, except Saturday
and Sunday, was spent for flying.
But when it was foggy or the wea¬
ther too inclement, it was winter
then, orders were given to them
not to fly. The afternoons were
spent in ground school, i. e., study¬
ing theoretical subjects like aero¬
dynamics, engines, airplane equip¬
ment, radio, and the like.
Speaking of flying, Lt. Luna
said take-offs and landings were
rather difficult to master properly.
Landings especially. For each
change of wind direction, there is
a change in landing position to


avoid mishap.
“I never was in danger,” he an¬
swered in response to a query of
that nature. “I always minded my
sticks and, if one pays attention
enough, he’ll find that airplane fly-
ing is much safer than driving an
automobile.
A Muddy Ground Loop
“But I remember one incident,"
he said. "It’s about a flying cadet.
He took off one morning while I
was coming down. He saw me then
and, to avoid me, applied his breaks
hard. His plane made a sudden
somersault, a ground loop.
“He was unhurt though, only ve¬
ry pale. He told me, when we took
him to the bathroom, that he had
never known the ground to come so
fast toward him! It didn’t lose the
fight in him, nevertheless.”
Stunt Flying
What is known as stunt flying is
just part of the regular training,
he explained. The first thing they
learned was "s-s on the road," or
plain zigzagging. They were also
taught the loop-the-loop, tailspin,
spirals, stalls, and figure eights.
A tailspin reminded him of a
flying officer who nearly spun him-
self to an early death. The fellow
was performing an inverted spin,
and he spun and spun until he could
not right his plane again. So the
officer hurriedly baled out and
sought the protection of his par¬
achute.
Major Zablan's Tragedy
Lt. Luna was still in the Islands
when Major Zablan met his death
there. The junior officer, however,
heard that the P. C. major struck
a hill in Boerne, Texas, while com-
ing home from a cross-country
flight. The tragedy occurred at
one o’clock past midnight, just six
or seven miles from Randolph
Field. He failed to locate the blaz¬
ing beacons, it was said.

UCH of the success of a
barrio teacher, or any
Micaher, for tiat matter, de¬
pends upon circumstances obtain¬
ing in the community and condi¬
tions in general. Adverse condi¬
tions and unfavorable circumstan¬
ces are apt to discourage the young
teacher who allows himself to be¬
come the victim of circumstances.
For him, there is no other alterna¬
tive. His destination is failure. On
the other hand, the resourceful,
vigorous, and tactful teacher will
make use of these adverse circum¬
stances as a means of accomplish¬
ing his objectives. If he finds upon
taking charge of his new school
that enrollment is small, attend-
ance poor and irregular, and the
building in a dilapidated condition,
fences broken, the people non-coop-
erative and even antagonistic to
school matters, he could make these
unfavorable conditions which are

seeming obstacles to his success,
means of securing the cooperation
of the people in the community.
thereby giving him an opportunity
of asserting his leadership and
winning the support of the people
he works with. It would give him
an opportunity for identifying him¬
self with customs, beliefs, tradi¬
tions, likes and dislikes of those he
comes in contact with. He would
have an opportunity to help retain
and cultivate customs and tradi¬
tions which are ennobling and for
which our race can justly be proud
of. He would have opportunities
to work for a gradual, but tactful
eradication of undesirable practi¬
ces which are dangerous to health
and morals. He would have the
rare opportunity, through the
strength of his character and per¬
sonality, to raise the social scale, if
not the standard of living, of those
he works with. In short, through
his own initiative, untiring effort,
tact, and force of personality, he
would find himself within a few
months an intellectual and social
leader, a model in conduct and an
exponent of the nobility of labor
in a community, which, perhaps, a
less energetic and less tactful pre¬
decessor of his, who, apparently,
had too much regard for his digni¬
ty and comfort, so he must have
chosen to follow the line of least
resistance, considered hopeless.
Here, then, is an example of a
teacher, starting apparently in the
face of serious difficulties, who
through patience and perseverance
the use of tact and judgment, wins
over to the side of the schools peo¬
ple who had hitherto been reluc¬
tant to give their support. For to
presume that the majority of par¬
ents in any community, even those
belonging to the poorest class, are
averse to the education of their


children and would not cooperate
with school people, is an unjust in-
dictment against our traditional
thirst for education and cultural
advancement.
Next to surmounting obstacles
which help his growth in adminis¬
trative efficiency, the new barrio
teacher is confronted with prob¬
lems respecting the financial ability
of the parents to keep their chil-
dren in school. I refer to health re¬
quirements respecting dress, etc.,
to requirements respecting writing
materials, and other necessary evils
outlawed by school administrators,
but which by necessity persist. Un¬
believable, but true, nevertheless,
there are pupils attending schools
out in the barrios whose parents
are so poor that they cannot pro¬
vide more than one suit of clothes
intact for their children. Many of
these children go to school and pick
their breakfast from the guava
bushes, if guavas are in season.
This is not hearsay. I have seen
specific cases and have been in the
homes of children of this class.
The tactless teacher, indifferent to
what goes around her, would berate
the poor child for a dress which is
none too clean and would make the
poor child’s stomach turn with fre¬
quent mention of eggs and milk as
necessasy diet for breakfast. Like¬
ly as not, the poor thing would be
called upon to say that that very
morning he had partaken of eggs
and milk. On top of that, the child
must provide himself with a pencil
and paper to boot. Of course, there
are those who would tell me that
a child so poor as that should not
go to school as he cannot afford it.
He is convicted and denied the op¬
portunity of getting an education


because of his poverty. But let
me tell you that it is often true
that the parents of children such as
I have just described are among
the most loyal school patrons, wil¬
ling to go to the limit in supporting
school activities with their labor
only of course, and that their chil-
dren seem to feel the thirst for
education more keenly than the oth-
ers. Here is an opportunity for a
teacher to cultivate a little sympa¬
thy and understanding, that the
blessings of education might be
dispensed to the sons of the wealthy
and the poor alike. The bureau’s
regulations must be enforced and
requirements must be met, some
way, somehow. Here is an oppor¬
tunity for you to help the poor par¬
ent out of the rut into which he
had fallen. Could you determine
the cause of his extreme poverty
without giving offense? Is it pos¬
sible he is the victim of fraudulent
transactions, or in the grip of usu¬
rious interests, or is the mere chat¬
tel of greedy, inhuman landlords?
Or, it may be possible that, be-
cause of his ignorance, he is con¬

ANCES, picnics, programs....
these are some of the activ¬
 ities of our Bachelors' Club.
Every Saturday evening we have a
dance to amuse ourselves. And
whenever one proposes swimming
or movie-going on the following
Sunday, nobody disagrees. For we
are all young—ages ranging from
sixteen to twenty years. And of
course one must be of our age to
be a member of our club!
Our club has a muse. We always
bestow the honor upon the most
beautiful girl in our locality. And
in our dance a few Saturdays ago,
Cecilia, Leonardo’s sweetheart, was
the fortunate girl. She was very
happy. After her proclamation as
muse, dancing was resumed. Every¬
body was happy, Cecilia and Leo¬
nardo especially. We danced and
danced till dawn.
Last Saturday evening we did
not have a dance. We could not—

She was so young—only sixteen

Yesterday evening we had a

we would hold a dance to choose

visitor to share the frugal meal. Of
course, the invited person should
use his discretion. More often than
not, the invitation is only for “hos¬
pitality’s" sake—only a pabalat bu¬
nga, as we, Tagalogs, call it.
Examples of this type of “hospi¬
tality” of course it is not hospi¬
tality in the strict sense of the
word, can be encountered anywhere,
from the streets to the classroom.
The most common of these, is a
girl’s blushing offer to a classmate
to “have a bite” of the already bit-
ten apple. As is expected, the oth-
er will smilingly decline such a plea¬
sure. But there are many naughty
young men who do try to bite the
apple. The girl blushes redder than
before, and the chances are that ten
to one she will withdraw the fruit!
It reminds me of a similar expe¬
rience.
It was Sunday afternoon. I had
a date with a friend to see Grace
Moore’s "Love Me Forever.” On
my way to my friend’s house I met
another friend who asked me where
I was going. Fool that I was, I did
not only answer his query but made
the idiotic mistake of inviting him
to go with me. But it was only a
pabalat bunga.
Imagine my embarrassment, nay,
chagrin when he accepted the invi¬
tation! It meant additional pecu¬
niary obligation, and I had a lean
purse. And not only that. It was
a date where “three is a crowd”.
and his presence was most unwel¬
come. To say that I did not enjoy
the show would be putting it very
mildly. I had to be amiable
to fit the benevolent role I was


playing while I was seething in¬
wardly, fighting an almost irre¬
sistible impulse to drive that friend
away from the adjacent chair. To
make the matter worse, he kept on
throwing furtive glances at the
girl between us and more than
once, I saw an ironical smile play¬
ing on his lips.
I learned my lesson. Since then
I never invited anyone unless I
meant it. No more pabalat bunga
invitations from me.

Due to the demand nowadays for
mining engineers in the Islands,
the Adamson School of Industrial
Chemistry and Engineering has
decided to open a mining engineer¬
ing course with major subjects in
Geology, Metallurgy, Ceramics, and
Petroleum Industry this coming
semester in June, 1936.
In preparation thereof, the school
has recently organized a mining
engineering department with facul¬
ty members mostly American min¬
ing and metallurgical engineers. A
complete set of apparatus for test¬
ing mineral ores and performing all
kinds of assays has been bought.
The newly installed assay and ana¬
lytical laboratory is one of the most
complete in the Islands. Mining
and engineering books and publica¬
tions have been placed in the libra¬
ry to furnish its students with a
ready and adequate source of refer¬
ences.


The Trade School Day celebra¬
tion of the Philippine School of
Arts and Trades which will be held
in March is expected to be success¬


ful and interesting. More projects
accomplished by the students in
this school are in readiness for ex¬
hibition. Aside from the permanent
booths that were annually orna¬
mented with various kinds of exhi¬
bit, an additional booth tor home¬
made projects of students, such as
model airplanes, electric motors,
model yachts, sail boats or motor
boats, photo electric cells, oil paint¬

the Romblon elementary pupils
sponsored a very lively and success¬
ful program on the entablado in
connection with the town fiesta.
The success of the affair was due

flying in the morning, and study¬
ing in the afternoon. They also
played athletic games, but not the
rough ones. They were forbidden
to play the rougher games, lest
they get hurt and be unable to con¬
tinue flying. During flying days
also, they slept no later than 10:00
p. m., whether they liked it or not.
Dancing Friday Nights
For recreation, they had dancing
during Friday nights. The offi¬


of heavy underclothing or rough
underclothing is often also apt to
increase the trouble. Sometimes it
is much worse after a meal or
after eating certain articles of
food to which one is susceptible.
In a goodly proportion of cases it
is caused by a sensitive condition
of the nervous system, which pro¬
duces an excessive irritability of
the skin. The itching is intense in
many cases and causes one to
scratch the skin so frequently and
so hard that often an eruption re¬
sembling eczema develops. This
adds to the discomfort of the per¬
son. In most cases a fast of a few
days is of value, fol owed by a
fruit juice diet. One should avoid
the wearing of heavy and rough
clothing next to the skin. One
should live an even, quiet life,
avoiding excitement, keeping the
eliminations freely active, and
should use any of the several local
measures such as Epsom salts
baths, sponging with bicarbonate
of soda solution, the application of
calamine lotion, simp e soothing
dusting powders, as well as often
the use of hot and cold packs.
Sometimes applying olive oil to the
skin will relieve the itching. Acid-
forming foods are best avoided,
and the diet, when it is general,
should consist largely of very
plain, simple non-irritating foods
such as fresh fruits and fruit
juices, fresh green vegetables raw
or cooked, vegetable and fresh sa¬
lads, mi'k, and other dairy pro¬
ducts.—From “Physical Culture.

NUlpano O THl PHILIT HiLO- By Rosales


Beautiful Bauang Beach
yR. James King "Mabuhay"
Steele, former executive secro¬
II tary of the Philippine Tourist
Association, once told the writer, “Up
north of Luzon is an interesting pecu¬
liarity that is perhaps unequalled in
any part of the globe. The City of
Baguio is extremely cold, situated as
it is at a very high elevation. Yet,
when its residents feel like imbibing
the soothing warm breezes of the low¬
lands, in but an hour and a half they
can motor to a near-by beach and there
bask in the warmth of the sun to their
hearts’ content. This proximity of a
cool place to a warm one is very un¬


their prizes anymore. So those
prizes, for non-collection, also went
to the coffers of the sweepstake
agencies.
Going Around Prohibitions
Another trick. Some agencies do
not buy tickets direct from the Ri¬
zal Avenue headquarters. Reason,
they do not want to be under its
regulations. So they hunt up a
regular agent of the Charity
Sweepstakes and buy from him, or
furnish him the money to buy tick-
ets with. The tickets, so acquired,
are subdivided into as many frac¬
tional units as are calculated to net
him a handsome profit.
Neither the board of trustees,


common."
Mr. Steele was referring to the en¬
chanting Bauang Beach, better known
as Long Beach, in the barrio of Parin¬
gao, four kilometers north of Bauang,
La Union. It stretches for many miles
by the placid China Sea.
The local Long Beach possesses many
of the characteristics of ideal beaches.
It has charm, what with the graceful
coconut palms and plants lining the
beach. Far from town, it is naturally
peaceful and restful there. In contrast
with other beaches in the Islands, its
water is clear and clean its sand
smooth and the water deepens gradual¬
ly. Dangerous corals, stones, and fishes
are absent.


nor Mr. Fabian Millar himself, can
go after this get-rich-quick agency
in a punitive way. The agency has
dealt directly with an agent, not
with the national charity organiza¬
tion itself, and is therefore not un¬
der any obligation to submit a pro¬
ject of fractional ticket division.
Mr. Millar can only punish the reg-
ular agent who sold the tickets by
preventing him from buying again.
That, however, is no remedy at
all. Another fellow, with the mon¬
ey, can buy tickets—and deliver
them to the unscrupulous agency.
Precaution in December Draw
To prevent illegal fractional
units from being sold last Decem¬


The sea here abounds in fishes, and
lovers of fishing usually take with
them their fishing paraphernalia when
they visit this charming beach. Cot¬
tages and rest-houses are provided
for the convenience of bathers. Ds¬
covered only about five or six years
ago by Baguio residents, this beach has
already become a popular pleasure
centre in the north. The availability
of good and fast transportation (it is
less than two hours away from Manila
by airplane) has helped to a certain de¬
gree in popularizing this resort. With
more improvement, it is expected, in
the future, to equal its famous name¬
sake in America’s west coast.


ber, every fractional unit was or¬
dered brought to the general office
at Rizal Avenue. These were dry¬
sealed, just like a notary public’s
seal on a legal document. But that
was not much help either. So very
few people understood the differ¬
ence—and the sweepstake office
have no secret service department
to go after the illegal agents. The
dry-sealing process was stopped this
year.
Besides, they forgot one thing.
Mr. Millar’s men simply looked
over the number of divisions, com¬
puted the prizes obtained, found
them correct, and approved the ap-
plication. They very well forgot
that it was plain waste of money


for a winner to obtain a prize be¬
low the price of his ticket. This
omission or oversight caused also
a lot of dissatisfaction.
For the June draw, however, the
Sweepstakes office—prior to last
week’s ruling—ordered that no
ten- or twenty-centavo coupons
should receive a prize below what
the holder paid for it. This has
been made possible by allowing no
more than ten tickets to be grouped
together, to insure bigger prizes.
Nevertheless, in the case of the
P36-consolation prizes, the coupon
holders will again receive pesetas
and centavos for their shares.
Last week’s order, it must be
pointed out, will not curb the sale
of fractional tickets. They can go
on subdividing them. Why? Be¬
cause there is no statutory law,
with a penalty attached, that can
punish them, especially when an
agency does not buy its tickets di¬
rect from the sweepstakes office.


NO JUSTICE FOR THIS...

secretary general of the league,
promised to bring the case up dur¬
ing the league’s meeting scheduled
this week. And possibly, a lawyer,
also from the south, will be re¬
quested to bring court action to
compel the erring husband to sup¬
port the family he abandoned.
Similar Cases Plenty
Similar cases, Mrs. Ronquillo re¬
lated, had come to the notice of the
Catholic Women’s League. Some
abandoned wives had come to them
for aid, legal and financial; and,
in all cases, both were given to them
immediately.
But it is vastly different with the
Commonwealth’s instruments of
justice. They refuse to go beyond
the walls of bureau regulations to
offer legal assistance. They could
not do a thing even, while destitute
wives and children suffer.

dification of the ruling. But it
should be admitted that this ruling
while it exists is not sufficient rea¬
son for any man to sit tight and even
starve waiting for a job to which
his education has qualified him. We
are happy to say here that we are
very proud of the author of the
above letter, in spite of his present
bitterness, because he accepted a
barrio teaching post and even ap¬
plied for a laborer’s job in spite of
his being a university graduate.
We only regret that not all uni¬
versity graduates are as educated
as he is. There is hope that the
imperfections in the government
may be corrected, but there is lit-
tle hope of putting sense in peop'e
whom not even a university edu¬
cation has made sensible.

F OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERVICE... 7
Continued from page 44
Notwithstanding our vaunted ef¬
ficient system of administration
and supervision, it is nevertheless
true that in some remote schools,
teachers are faced with many se¬
rious problems arising from inade¬
quate supply of textbooks, writing
and seat work materials, manuals
of instruction, teaching aids, and
other instructional materials, ina¬
dequate equipment, poor health fa¬
cilities, and a thousand and one
odds against instruction. Despite


such handicaps, a resourceful, de¬
pendable teacher, given an oppor¬
tunity to prove his mettle and a
freedom to exercise his common
sense and initiative, will still suc-
ceed. If textbooks are not enough
to go around, if instructional ma¬
terials are inadequate, he would
devise means, permissible under
generally accepted methods of in¬
struction, to provide substitute
material and adapt his technique
of instruction accordingly. Thanks,
however, to the efforts of our
school administrators, conditions in


the remote barrios are being im-
proved. There is a gradual rever¬
sion of the practice followed in pre¬
vious years of supplying the cen¬
tral schools first with the best of
equipment and the newest of text¬
books.

14th-15th, at the Batan Elementary
School, Batan, Capiz, conducted by
Mr. Juan Plopino of the General
Office. Mr. Severino Caridad, di¬
vision academic-industrial super¬
visor; and Miss Dizon, division
home economics supervisor, were
also present. The first day of the
conference was devoted to the
making of different kinds of pro¬
jects. Each was very enthusiastic
about his work. Several supervis¬
ing teachers finished very good
toys. During the second day Mr.
Plopino discussed with the super-
visors and teachers several points
which will materially improve the
industrial arts instructions. The
division superintendent, Mr. Jose
V. Aguilar, incidentally informed
those in the conference that the
shops of the Capiz Elementary
Schoo' and of the Batan Element-
ary School are the best in the di¬
vision.

ILOCOS SUR
A whole day affair of education¬

was observed by and given for the
teachers of District No. 1, Division
of Ilocos Sur, last February 22nd
in connection with the celebration
of Washington Day in Cabugao.
llocos Sur.
Demonstration classes and gen¬
eral conferences were observed by
all the teachers and school of¬
ficials in the morning. A well
prepared lunch at noon at the
home economics cottage was of¬
fered in honor of school officials,
visitors and teachers. A musical¬
literary program was shown to the
peop.e in the afternoon.
To conclude the whole-day prog-
ram, a NEPA and halo-halo me¬
rienda party was offered at the
home economics cottage where
plenty of “tinubong,” “cascaron,"
opia,” "bibingca," and “Macao¬
pansit,” were served to the public.

SORSOGON
“All work and no play,” Super¬
vising Teacher Max O. Songco, of
the Donsol-Pilar district, sagely
told his teachers in a district con¬
ference, "makes Jack a dull boy.”
“Okay, Chief,” the teachers said
in unison. “We’ll bite."
“The line is antique," commented
a self-appointed critic from a fron¬
tier school. “Besides we’re over.
and above the kindergarten age
level."
The lady teachers turned their
erstwhile innocent faces now filled
with fury and murder, on him.
The barrio cynic remembered his
Psychology (first semester) and
stirred uneasily in his seat. “I
won’t be brow-beaten,” he bravely¬
weakly stuttered.
A judicious pin-prick delivered
from behind and below the belt
made him how and finish his
oppositionistic tendencies altoget¬
her.
Thereafter it was smooth sail-
ing. An idea was born and car¬
ried to fruition. The teachers, as¬
sisted by Principals Natalia R. Dag¬
nalan and Juan Grafilo of Donsol
and Pilar, respectively, directed
their energy to a new and a more
congenial channel.
The result was a successful ex¬
cursion to Gimagaan-By-the-Sea,
Donsol, on Feb. 8th. The teach¬
ers, the cynic included, and some of
their friends and relatives enjoyed
the affair immensely. Hiking.
swimming, boating, and more of
that sort of thing they indulged in.
Admirers and debunkers of Chas.
Lamb’s "Dissertation on Roast
Pig” shook hands and declared ar¬
mistice over the remains (or were
there any?) of the subject of the
essay.
Hostesses of the occasion were
Mrs. Eufrosina S. Rabulan and
Miss Guadalupe Lorena, charming
teachers of the Gimagaan Public
School.

seconds off his Philippine record in
the 1,500-meter run during the
opening of the national track and
field meet the other Saturday p. m.
at the Rizal Memorial Field, nego¬
tiating the distance in 4 minutes,
6.1 seconds. N. Ramirez of the
U S.T. likewise shattered his pre¬

record of 23 feet, 2-1% inches by
leaping to a distance of 24 feet 3
inches.


The 1936 national track honors
were early last week captured by
the army unit by running away with
39 points. The U P., defending
champion, placed third, with 26
points. The education unit piled up
28 points. However the state univ-
ersity copped the f'eld champion¬
ship, scoring 21 points to the army’s
20. In the women’s competition,
Central School garnered 29 mark¬

broadest sense, as a devotion to a
higher ideal. While our youth may
have lost its anthropomorphic idea
of God, and of heaven and hell, they
have not abandoned their search for
a better knowledge and a clearer
concept of Him. And while many
of our young people may have lost
their belief in the divinity of
Christ, or their belief in the Vir¬
gin Mary, they are far from being
un-Christian, for they still believe
in the teachings of the Great Teach-
er and live in accordance with the
teachings of Christ. And, after all,
if we judge the Christian religion
in terms of Christ’s teachings rat¬

concerning His personality, we
would probably be surprised to find
that our youth is far more reli¬

MRS. QUEZON ARRIVES.

arrived last week, "and I decided to
pay my first visit since the elec¬
tion of my husband to our neigh-
bors on this side of the globe. I
have gone abroad several times but
this was the first time I visited
the countries of Malaysia.... I car¬
ry with me lasting impressions of
this trip. More of us should visit
these countries near our Archipela¬
go. We must know them better
and foster closer ties of friendship,
good will, and understanding."
The wife of the President of the
Commonwealth brought home news
of the keen interest which our
neighbors have towards this coun¬
try. “The officials of the coun¬
tries we visited,” she related, "were
very attentive and they did all in
their power to make our visit plea¬
sant. We are grateful to all of
them. But what thrilled me more
than anything else is the keen in¬
terest shown by the common peo¬
ple in our government and the kind
expressions of faith in our future.
They wanted to know all about our
Commonwealth and there was
something in the manner they
asked their questions that made me
feel they are anxiously, even pray¬
erfully, watching developments
here. But I was in no official or
political trip. I was only travelling
for pleasure and rest. I am de¬
lighted to be back home and happy
to be with my husband and chil¬
dren again."
President Quezon, accompanied
by the Quezon children and by ma¬
ny friends of the Quezons, met
Mrs. Quezon outside the breakwa¬
ter.
All day last Tuesday, streams of
visitors called on the returned First
Lady of the Land. Co-eds of the
Philippine Women’s University
sang a chorus composed by Direc¬
tor Francisco Santiago of the U. P
Conservatory of Music when the
launch carrying the Presidential
family moored at Malacanang.

man Felipe Buencamino, and Dr.

understanding and sympathy The
strength and solidity of the Jap-
anese empire is attributed to its
people’s religious and patriotic
training, in spite of the falsity of
their religious beliefs.
Negatively, the fall of religion
precedes the decay of a nation.
Consider the once powerful Roman
and Greek empires which crumbled
because their peoples forgot their
religion, and the resulting incre¬
dulity and skepticism poisoned the
minds of the masses.
I am not an alarmist, but I am
sincere in my belief that the gov¬
ernment must do something to solve
the problem of our drifting away
from religion or else the disorders
which are brewing everywhere will
assume alarming proportions.
A troubled country seeks justice
and bullets cannot drive peace into
it. The people cannot obey the laws
of the land if they see that the men
who run the government abuse their
authority due to their un-Christian
lives For the lack of faith, hope,
and charity brings skepticism to
the masses and destroys them.
Likewise the ministers of reli¬
gion must live according to what
they preach in the churches if they
want to keep the already skeptical
younger generation from becoming
more skeptical. The young people
are quick to notice the disparity be¬
tween what a minister teaches and
how he lives.
It must be remembered, however,
that no person who cannot trust
himself can trust another person
The Christian virtues, faith, hope,
and charity, must begin at home.
And yet what is the family at pre¬
sent doing to foster religion among
the children? Very little if at all.
It seems the present Filipino family
is indifferent to the spiritual en¬
richment of the children’s lives.
In the past, however poor the
family and however busy it was
making both ends meet, the father
and mother took pains to teach the
children the rudiments of religion.
And if they were not able to do
this—or if they thought they could
not do the task well enough—they
sought other persons or institutions
to do it for them.
Now the family lets the children
grow unguided in matters pertain¬
ing to religion; and the children,
noting the indifference of their
elders, naturally seek the easiest
way. As if this were not enough,
our government restricted the
chances of children studying reli¬
gion in schools
Many would argue that children
assume a skeptical attitude toward
religion anyway when they grow up
because of the teachings of science.
This may be true, but a strong re¬
igious foundation built early in life
cannot be shaken by the buffeting
ur higher institutions may inflict.
To those who have received an early
and true religious training, science
only makes them nearer to God. For
then they realize that the wonder¬
ful and precise laws of science can


only be controlled and could have
been conceived only by a Superior
Being Who rules the universe, a
God Who rewards the good and
punishes the evil. Indeed religion,
if true, is enough to make the peo¬
ple law-abiding and peaceful citi¬
zens.

EXPLOITATION NOT

Continued from page 6
She sat down in a chair in front
of me as if to calm herself down
and said, "Well, yes."
"Why?”
“He wants to be a teacher and
manager at the same time,” she
said in a piqued voice.
“But, isn’t Arthur Judson of
New York your manager?”
“Yes, but it sounds ridiculous
to have two managers for the boy
at the same time.
“Speaking of the boy, have you
any definite plan to assure the
normal growth of your child?”
“Yes, that’s what I want to do.
I want to assure the normal growth
of my child, not commercialize him,
not to let any person exploit him. I
want to give my child education
aside from the violin. I want to
send him to school. I want to bring
him up as other children. I want
to give him something more than
music, something he could turn to
besides playing the violin. You
know not that I anticipate it, but
one can never tell; something
might happen to his fingers and
then what would become of him?
If Felix had no real education, if
he had no background, he would be
helpless, do you see? I happen to
be a Philippine Normal School
graduate myself and I taught pub¬
lic school for three years, and I
know what education really means
to an individual. Furthermore, the
spiritual background of my boy lies
in my personal guidance. Felix is
now attending the St. Viviana’s
Cathedral School. He is very reli¬
gious. Yes, I have to attend to his
spiritual life as well as his general
education. Of course, I understand,
music is the language of the human
soul and all that and I want Felix
to bring happiness to people
through his chosen art....
I saw her point: she was a mo¬
ther fighting for her right to insure
Felix’s future.
This thought
prompted me to ask: "Have you in¬
sured his fingers?”
“I have,” she replied.
I wanted to ask her how much,
but at this juncture I saw Felix in
the living room with a light shot-
gun, firing at some object I could
not see. I excused myself from
Mrs. Abcede, asking her whether

or not she would mind if I asked
her son a few questions. "Oh, no,
go ahead," she said.
“How’s your aim?” I asked the
boy violin genius. His dark long
hair combed a la Pompadour looked
like a black beret. He had specs
on, which made him look years old¬


er.
“Mamma... he hollered, as if
to say, this newspaper guy is tak¬
ing me for a ride. He did not mean
it that way, though; he just called
for his mother to see if it was all
right for him to answer my ques¬
tions. His mother assured him


from the other room, “Oh, that’s
all right, honey. He just wants to
ask you a few questions.” Felix
then turned to me and said, "My
aim is not so good.” And again he
aimed at the target he had set
against a cushion in an armchair
four yards or so away from where
he stood. He fired, but the bullet
didn’t make the bull’s-eye. He
shook his head, "My aim is bad."
He sat down on a piano stool hug¬
ging his gun.
1
'Is shooting your hobby?”
asked.
“Yes, and archery, too,” he re¬
plied, looking at the muzzle of his
gun.
"Felix,” I said, "I read in the pa¬
pers that you didn’t play in San
Francisco. Why?”
“I didn’t have a violin."
“How about your violin?”
"It’s not my violin yet. I have a
violin in the house, but I don’t use
it. I use it only for practice. The
violin I use for concerts is two hun¬
dred years old and it costs a lot,
too. It’s not mine yet. It will be
mine when I have paid completely
for it. We are still paying for it.
We rent it when I use it.”
“Have you any favorite violin¬
ists? Who?”
"“I like Jascha Heifetz. I like
Kreisler, too."
“By the way, do you practise
every day? The papers say you
have not touched a violin for
weeks."
“That’s a lie. I practise every
day. I stayed with my professor
every day till the last day we left
for San Francisco."
“Yeah?”
“Yes, you ask Mamma.”
“The papers say you are temper¬
amental."
“That’s a lie. I don’t like it.”


“The papers say you are a ge¬
nius, Felix. What do you think of
that?” I asked, observing him
closely.
“Brrrrh...” he burred his lips.
“I don’t like it."
“Aren’t you pleased?”
“No, I don’t like it. I don’t like
being called a genius.” He rose
from his seat, loaded his gun with
spellets and fired at his target.
“My aim is not so good,” he said.
“That’s all, Felix. Thanks a lot,”
I said, and started back to Mrs.
Abcede.
“Mrs. Abcede,” I said, "I have a
clipping here I’d like to show you.
It says your son is temperamen¬
tal."
She took the clipping from my
hand and after reading a para¬
graph or two, broke out, “That’s a
lie. My son is not temperamental.
He is a normal child. Tell that to
the world. Refute that statement
in the paper. It’s a lie. I don’t
like this item. Where did you get
it?”
“From a local daily.”
"Felix temperamental? It’s a
lie. Felix couldn’t play in San
Francisco because Borissoff was
holding up the violin. I wired him
to send it by express, but he didn’t
send it; neither did he go up north
to complete arrangements for my
son’s appearance."
“May I see Josephine?” I said
after a respectful pause. Josephine
is Felix’s sister, about seven years
old, a member of the Hollywood Ba¬
by Orchestra when that organiza-
tion was active. She will soon be
an accomplished pianist.
The mother called for her. Jose¬
phine was playing in the adjoining
room. She came to us immediately.

INCREASED
The prizes in the Health Picture
Contest, published in   on
January 16, 1936, have been vir¬
tually raised to a total of P8,540.00,
because every participant in the
contest will be given a premium
sweepstake share ticket.
Partly for this reason and part-
ly because of the numerous requests
from students who cannot work on
the problem of the contest due to
the approaching final examinations,
the date of closing for entries has
been extended to April 30, 1936.

and before Pasig Boulevard was put through. We are willing to take a big loss
on a few of these fine Boulevard lots to get building started in this newer sec-
tion. Selection of any of the unsold lots in Section “F” close to the purchases of
such well-known buyers as Hon. Alex Reyes, Hon. Miguel Unson, Hon. P. Lesa¬

COMMENTS
ZONING IN MANILA T VERYBODY thinks there should be a
D zone system in Manila. Only, the dif-
ficulty is, how? This, at least, seems to be the state of things in the
municipal board where the board has one idea about zoning and the
mayor another.
Whether Manila will have zonification or not is not known at this
writing. But we should like to say, from a perusal of the zoning report
prepared by the zoning committee, that there would be more justice done if
the zoning idea were confined to the designation of residential and offen¬
sive industry areas. There is need, certainly, for strictly residential areas
to protect the health of the community from the noise of certain indus¬
tries, and the offensive to sight or smell or disturbing to people at rest
should have their designated place. Other than these zones, no other
ones are necessary.
Y N Ilagan, Isabela, last week, the President
WHY NOT START
WITH CITY POLICE? I in his usual “fire-eating” style said he
will “fire every crooked official this year.”
May we respectfully suggest to the President to please start with the
police in Manila?
In the short space of a few days, two members of the Capital’s police
force resorted to plain robbery in trying to earn extra money. Just
how many more in the force are in this racket of earning side money
gangster style or in other styles only a thorough scrutiny will unearth.
Let’s see the President order such a scrutiny.
* * *
A TEST r-HE President has committed himself last week to the
1 abolition of the sweepstakes. Can he do it? We ask this
because hardly a week after the President pronounced the death sentence
on the sweepstakes, a move to continue the lottery has already started.
Assemblyman Juan Luna plans to convince the Assembly to continue the
sweepstakes to collect money for public works.
Now we ask: is the government so bankrupt of ideas to raise revenue
to cover expenditures for needed public works that it now proposes to
raise the money by exploiting the gambling instinct of the people? Or
if this is such a sound idea, why not abolish all the taxes and raise all
the revenue needed by the government through the sweepstakes?
* *
JUSTICE FOR ALL? YUYE love to think that there is justice for
V everybody in this country: justice for
those who have the means to hire counsel and for the indigent, both. But
is this true?
We have in this issue of  , on page 10, the sad story of a wo¬
man whose husband has consistently refused to support his wife and four
daughters. She has obtained the services of a lawyer but it appears the
lawyer is in no hurry to get results because, as this unfortunate woman
explains, the lawyer could not expect much for his services.  
brought this case to the attention of the proper government officials and,
as may very well be read in the article on page 10, the government, it
appears, cannot do anything for this woman.
If this woman had the means to hire good counsel, even if she did
not need help for the support of her children, she could get the husband
to contribute to the support of his offspring. As it is she has no money,
she is asking for her husband’s help only because she has no adequate
resources with which to rear her children properly. And what is worse,
her lack of resources is preventing her from getting the justice due her
and her children.
Justice for all? In theory, yes, but not actually.
By The EDITOR:


In Justice
Y NGENIOUS, these gentlemen
M who pass for city fathers for
Manila, who deserve to be city
fathers, judging from their inge¬
nuity.
It appears these gentlemen are
set on staying on the job of being
city fathers, there being many
things they want done before they
die, like having a little fun, educa¬
ting the children, lining the purse
for the rainy day, and dernonstra¬
ting to Manilans how not to run
their government.
And here comes a certain Mr.
Quezon who is reputed to have
been made a new man by the puri¬
fying air at Malacanang with an
order to kill jueteng in the country,
including Manila. Well, Mr. Que¬
zon can kill jueteng in the country
but not in Manila.
Just to show Mr. Quezon the city
fathers intend to run Manila the
way the city fathers want it
run, which means to run the
city so the city fathers can hang on
to the job so they can finish all
those jobs they want done for
themselves and if possible for the
city, just look at the way the city
fathers treated the Quezon-ins¬
pired Department of the Interior
model jueteng ordinance. The or¬
dinance was handed to them by
the mayor and in no time the ma¬
yor had the ordinance back in his
hands, with the N. G. (no good)
tag.
In justice to the city fathers,
who are famous for their affection
for the unemployed and the down-
trodden who can vote, they cannot
very well approve this new jueteng
ordinance which would fine and
clap in jail jueteng players, collect¬
ors, and maintainers. After all,
these people who dabble in jueteng
are only trying to make a little
money and they are such nice
people during election days, that is,
they vote for the city fathers, and
the city fathers are very grateful,
of course, because if they are not,
they don’t get the votes. And then
what would happen to that nice
job at the city hall?
Mr. Quezon after all is a very
generous man himself, for which
ex-Senators Sandiko and Generoso
and the rest of the Belo boys are
profoundly grateful. Why not
allow the city dads the same gen¬
1 erosity?
