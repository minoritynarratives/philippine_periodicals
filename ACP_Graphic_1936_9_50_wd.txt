— Nour younger days, one of our big¬
gest rackets was in connection with
A the purchase of our own textbooks:
we used to charge the old man and old
lady twice the cost of the books. We un¬
derstand it is still a paying racket among
students. But probably, not for long. For
to relieve parents from the burden of
costly books for their children, Assembly-
man Guillermo Z. Villanueva is sponsor¬
ing a movement for cheaper textbooks:
less expensive paper, less expensive bind¬
ing. The old lady and the old man may
be fairly dense, but even they will under¬
stand that cheaply printed and bound
books don’t cost a lot. And it will be a
boon, too, to students who at present have
to do without many a needed thing to be
able to get the necessary, but costly school
books. For full details, turn to page 4.
Incidentally we understand Assem¬
blyman Villanueva is in sympathy with
the Japanese system of separating boys
and girls in school. A few parents among
them Fausto de los Santos and Venancio
Baliad, see page 9, would very probably
go a step farther and prohibit male tea¬
chers from teaching girls. And also,
with the separation of girls from boys,
editorial offices will very likely receive
fewer poems from schoolboys so love-sick
they imagine they are poets. But believe
it or not, at least according to A. R. Da¬
canay of our staff, there are at least a
few decent lines in the verses of love-sick
school swains. Turn to page 13 and see
if you agree with him.
BOUT Filipino boys in the U.S.: Mrs.
A Asuncion Perez, general secretary of
the Associated Charities, and Mrs. Gero¬
nima T. Pecson, prominent social worker,
who left the Islands for the U. S. re¬
cently for a visit, had an interesting talk
with the boys there, and you can be sure
the subject was girls (page 21). But do
not get the impression that all Pinoys
have in their mind are "skirts. Out
there in Chicago, Luis S. Quianio reports
that the lads are going in for athletics
(remember his article on golf-goofy
Pinoys?) and forgetting oratory. This
time, see page 16, it is basketball and you
will be surprised to know that among
Chicago Filipino star basketball players
are a few former Far Eastern first¬
raters.
y OW about our favorite poison:
A, rackets. The other day we received
a letter, one of those chain-letter schemes
designed to make us rich for only
twenty centavos. We wrote to the city
fiscal asking for an opinion as to the
standing of the association heading this
financial device and what do you think
we got for our pains? Exactly nothing.
Better turn to page 12, we have more
room there for the many things we have
in our chest with respect to financial
rackets.
Which reminds us of how much more
we love the President for stopping the
contribution rackets (page 10) in gov¬
ernment offices. It takes a big guy like
the Prexy to stop a racket of that kind
because in more times than one, he was
the innocent beneficiary of these rackets.

A. S. Gabila is the
author of Do You Re¬

G. writes: “Born
S.
November 6, 1913; started
writing in earnest after
graduation from college,
had been writing before
that but not for national
publications, on ly for
school and college organs.
I don’t believe I have
A. S. Gabila written my masterpiece
yet. Tired of the prov¬
inces, sensing a trap. Hope some kind
editor calls me to Manila and gives me a
job... and, oh, yes—single. And we are
not surprised A. S. G. is single if he
loves like the hero in Do You Remember?
The author had two other stories
published in  , his first, The
Square Peg, was his first published story
in a national magazine and included in
Jose Garcia Villa’s list of distinctive
stories for 1934. A. S. G writes not
only fiction but feature articles.

and handkerchief knotted at the neck and
of course the equally inevitable dalaga in

early morning and a double-barrelled gun.
Now, don’t jump at conclusions. We were

soon out in his night

MAYBE, A
N page six of this issue we have an article by Dr. Andres
( Castillo, economist attached to the department of finance,
answering the arguments of Sen. Adams against the right of the
Philippines to profit from the devaluation of the dollar. Dr. Cas¬
tillo’s counter arguments, from the Philippine standpoint, at least,
are very convincing.
But even if the gold profit amounting to P47,725,500
is rightly ours, of what practical benefit will this profit
be to us if we cannot have the amount so we can make use
of it?
It is true there is a law crediting the Philippines with the
profit, but congress has consistently failed or refused to make the
necessary appropriation for the amount. And on top of this the
senate has just passed a measure repealing the law authorizing
the payment of the profit.
And there is the excise tax on P. I. oil, now amounting to
about P56,000,000, also rightly belonging to the Philippines by
virtue of the law which authorizes the tax and the turning over
to the Philippine government of the money collected. The money
cannot now be given to the Philippine government because various


KIND TURN
court litigations involving the constitutionality of the tax have
tied up the money. And what is worse, there is now a move in
the senate to so amend the excise tax law as to divert the tax col¬
lected from the Philippine to the U. S. treasury.
It is all so easy to say that in all fairness, the U. S. govern¬
ment should give us what is due us. Indeed, that is the only
thing we can say, and wait for the fairness to materialize. On
the whole the U. S. has always been fair to us, why not now?
But in view of the difficulties the U. S. is in, she, very evid-
ently, is determined to be fair to herself first, no matter how un¬
fair this may look from the outside. If this tendency should per¬
sist and the Philippines should suffer in consequence, a change in
the traditional Philippine attitude towards Philippine-American
relations is inevitable. Not that it would matter to the United
States as much as it would to the Philippines, but has the Philip-
pines any choice?
Or is the U. S., in fact, doing the Filipinos a kind
turn by forcing them to think of their welfare independ¬
ently of the help the U. S. had been lavish with in the
past:

or “ear-marked" gold to suit their
convenience. These countries could
claim no profit if their reserves
were caught in the devaluation of
the dollar because they are not
compelled by law to keep their re¬
serves in the United States. The
case of the Philippines, however,
should be treated in a different
manner because the peso is pegged
to the dollar and follows the for¬
tune of the American currency.
The American Government made a
huge profit on its gold reserves;
there is no reason why the Philip-
pine Government should be denied
the same windfall.
Petition Denied
Before the bank holiday in the
United States which definitely
showed that a financial storm was
raging the Philippines petitioned
the administration in the United
States that the currency reserves
be regarded as “ear-marked" gold


and properly safeguarded against
any possible diminution in value,
but no action as requested was tak¬
en. The rapid succession of events
including the gold embargo which
culminated in the Gold Reserve Act
of January 31, 1934, justified our
fear for the currency reserves. But
the Philippines can only propose
and the United States government
has the sole power to dispose.
Need for Independent System
The establishment of an indepen¬
dent currency system including the
creation of a central bank to man¬
age it has been proposed, but its
full significance has not yet been
fully realized. An independent cur¬
rency system for the Philippines
would not necessari'y mean the
abandonment of the gold exchange
standard linked with the gold
standard of the United States. It
simply means that we would have
full control over our currency re¬
serves and distribute them in dif-
ferent financial centers, possibly


London and Paris. So long as our
trade is principally with the United
States, it would be advisable to
keep the greater part of the re¬
serves there with the difference
that we could withdraw them to
suit our purposes.
While it is true that we did not
suffer one dollar of loss in our bank
deposits, we indeed have suffered a
a loss to the amount of the gold
profit as a result of the failure of
the U.S. administration to act when
we decided to convert our reserves
into gold bullion to back up an in¬
dependent currency system. We
would still be getting the same
number of dollars, it is true, but in
terms of gold it would be minus 40
per cent of the weight of the gold
dollar before devaluation. There is
very little danger that further de¬
valuation may take place but it
may happen and it would mean fur¬
ther losses to our reserves. As a
matter of precaution we should
take steps to protect our reserves
from this eventuality.

MENDIOLA DEFEATS GEN
Despite the fact that Joe Men¬
diola knocked down Umio Gen twice
in the third round, the Filipino
slugger barely won the 10-round
bout held at the Rizal Memorial
Field last Saturday night. Men¬
diola annexed three rounds, the Jap-
anese the same number, while four
were even. In the last round, Gen
so badly outboxed the Filipino lad
that many believed the fight should
have been a draw. In the other
main event, Hanada drew with
Speed Cabanela. The Japanese was
booed by the crowd because of his
backpedalling.

Paper-Bound Books
All the textbooks in Japan, from
the kindergarten up to the highest
grade in the middle school (high
school), are bound not with expen¬
sive cloth as those we have here but
with stiff paper. The material used
in the pages is likewise inexpen¬
sive, a little bit higher in quality
than that used in local weeklies, but
the printing and the ilustrations
are excellent. One salient char¬
acteristic of Japanese textbooks is
their being profusely illustrated,
not with photographs but with
crayon sketches most of which are
in full colors. What Japanese books
lack in quality of paper and bind¬
ing, they make up in their contents.
The books in Japan cost that low,
obviously because of the cheap lab-
or and power available in the coun-
try. However, it is not impossible
for us to turn out textbooks as
low-priced as those in Japan.

the intermediate grades. This book
costs P0.25 a copy despite the fact
that the paper used is of high qual¬
ity and that it contains 326 pages
—actually two times cheaper than
the textbooks of Japan, for the
P0.25-books they have in Japan con¬
tain only around 150 pages.
Considering the fact that only
10000 of these books have been
printed, the price could be reduced
to P0 20 a copy if 100,000 of them


were turned out.
The bureau of printing has put
out around 15 different kinds of
these inexpensive paper-bound sup¬

J. Scott MeCormick, chief of the
academic division of the bureau of
education, explained that the bureau
has not at all totally failed to con¬
sider the possibility of adopting


paper-bound books here. In fact,
he said, some of the textbooks act-
ually being used in the public
schools are of that variety.
“We will probably try using the
cheaper kind of paper and binding
like those used in Japan,” Mr. Mc¬
Cormick said. “But our aim would
be not to strike upon the cheapest
kind of bocks from the point of
view of actual price, but the least

Dr. Andres V. Castillo: explains why
the P. I. is entitled ta share in the
gald profit resulting from the devalua¬
tion of the dollar.
P2,800,000,000 as a result of deva¬
luation but the Philippines, it is
contended now, should not be al¬
lowed to make any profit for va¬
rious reasons advanced by Sen¬
ator Alba Adams.
Reasons Against P.I. Claim
Among the reasons given for not
crediting the Philippines with any
profit as a result of the devalua¬
tion of the dollar (from 25.8 grains
to 15-5421 grains of its gold con¬
tent) are that the Philippines has
no gold reserve and has no curren¬
cy requiring redemption in gold. It
is also advanced that the Philip-
pines suffered not one dollar of
loss in its bank deposits, and that
the Philippine Government is not
entitled to any unwarranted profit
upon its bank deposits when the
same benefit is denied similar de¬
posits of the American states, other
public bodies, and other American
citizens. The Philippine Govern-
ment is claimed to be on the same
footing as other depositors.
Some of these reasons are justi¬
fied but there are reasons that
place the currency reserves depo¬
sited with banks in the United
States on a different category
from other deposits. Let us exa¬
mine these reasons.
P. I. Claim
The Philippines is on the gold
exchange standard linked with the
gold standard of the United States
by Congressional enactment of
1903. The gold exchange standard
cannot operate without gold. The
peso is kept at parity with gold by
maintaining reserves in the United
States for the settlement of our
foreign trade ba’ances. We are rea¬
dy to sell drafts on these reserves
and these drafts are claims on gold
and they are as valuable as gold
coin or gold bars. The Philippines
has no gold reserve as there is no
necessity of depositing actual gold
since we have credit on gold and
can get it whenever we like to have
gold.
It is claimed that the Philippines
had no gold coin and no currency


to the bearer on demand in silver
pesos or in gold coin of the United
States of equivalent value. Gold
coins of the United States before nancial storm that may sweep the
the devaluation of the dollar were
unlimited legal tender in the Phil-
ippines. For some time during the
early days of the American admi¬
nistration, gold coins circulated
freely in the Philippines.
It is not fair to compare the re¬
serves of the Philippine Govern-
ment with the deposits of Amer¬
ican citizens and other public bo¬
dies. The deposits of the Philip-
pine Government are reserves for
the currency under a system that
is an appendage of the American
currency system, while other depo¬
sits are ordinary debts of the banks.
These reserves are secured by Uni¬
ted States Government bonds which
are also redeemable in gold.
The Philippines does not have an
independent currency system; the
Commonwealth has no full power
over currency matters. The cur-
rency system was set up in the
Philippines by Congressional enact-
ment which requires the keeping
of the currency reserves in the Uni¬
ted States. Whether the Philip-
pines likes it or not the reserves
must be kept with United States
banks designated as depositories of
the American government. We
have no choice as to the financial

Department of Finance
which is required to be redeemed center in which to deposit our cur¬
in gold. This is not accurate. Our rency reserves, a requirement not
Treasury certificates are payable imposed on ordinary depositors.
We cannot withdraw the currency
reserves and place them in London
or Paris in order to avoid any fi¬
United States.
P.I. Currency Different Case
The gold exchange standard of
the Philippines is quite different
from the gold exchange standard of
other countries which kept part of
their currency reserves with banks
in New York shortly after the war.
These countries have full power
over their currency system and
could peg their currency unit to
that of any other country like the
pound or the franc. They can
withdraw their reserves which
were in the form of bank balances

FLOOR LEADER OUTLINES
TASKS OF ASSEMBLY


YrVO date, over a hundred legis¬
lative measures have already
A been filed with the bill divi¬
sion of the National Assembly. The
subjects, as usual, cover a wide
range; but when the Assembly
convenes on June 16th, immediate
solution of the country’s financial
problems will be given first consi¬
deration. At least that is what
Floor Leader Jose Romero reveal¬
ed in his speech before Manila
Rotarians last Thursday.
The 1937 national budget, care¬
fully prepared by the budget com¬
mission under Serafin Marabut,
will be discussed first of all by the
National Assembly. The budget
carries new outlays, national de¬
fense appropriation being one of
them. A balanced budget is as¬
sured, however, because business
is improving, thus promising in¬
creased collections in government
revenues.
Taxation Under Study
With the budget disposed of,
It was true a resolution had been

expensive in the long run.
According to the academic divi¬
sion chief, the bureau has a com¬
mittee of about 20 men which for
the last two years has been work¬
ing on the preparation of 15 dif-
ferent kinds of textbooks in read¬
ing and language for pupils from
the first up to the seventh grade.
“Whether we will use paper bind-
ing and cheaper quality of paper
for these textbooks, we have not

is a great probability that we
might, for there are actually two
books now for the third and fourth
year classes being printed at the
bureau of printing which will
have paper binding.

(Continued on page 50)

the assembly will next tackle the
touchy job of revising the Islands"
system of taxation. The Assem-
bly’s committee on ways and
means has several recommenda¬
tions to make, although no radical
changes will be offered. The tax
revision, said Floor Leader Rome¬
ro, will offer "a more equitable
distribution of the tax burden, so
that everyone may give his fair
contribution to the government,
reaching those who have somehow
escaped their fair share."
He also added: “Cooperation of
capital, as of everybody else, to
any fair revision of the system of
taxation should be accorded the
government, because what is paid
in taxes will come back in increas¬
ed or better public services, in pro¬
tection, in improvement in condi¬
tions under which capital may
operate, and in increasing the
general welfare and tranquillity.”
To Purchase Friar Estates
Sketchily, Assemblyman Romero
pictured present-day labor and
agrarian troubles as still on their
incipient stages. But it would be
wise, he added, to find remedies
immediately to prevent their
growth into alarming proportions.


passed authorizing the government
to negotiate hacienda purchases,
but the resolution was permissive,
not mandatory.
The next sessions of the Nation-
al Assembly, however, will square¬
ly tackle the problem of purchas¬
ing those estates. The outlay
would strain the resources of the
country, said the floor leader,
“but the sacrifice would be worth-
while if it is necessary to remove
causes for friction; if it would, in
effect, improve the lot of the great
number of tenants."


Sec. Ramon Torres: says there is
justification for the dissatisfaction among
the masses.
New Deal for Labor
Labor, especially the agricul¬
tural kind, might get its just re¬
ward this year. Of course, the
new deal will not come in the
form of a general minimum wage
law. But a scale of wages might


be established to apply to certain
classes of laborers and even for
certain regions.
“The Government,” emphasized
Mr. Romero, "should be able to re¬
medy a situation where laborers
and their families are required to
subsist on less than half a peso a
day while the employers roll in
wealth, simply because there is an
excess of labor and there is keen
cempetition for employment. Such
a situation is not conducive to so¬
cial peace."
Defends Quezon's Attitude
Incidentally, the floor leader of¬
fered a reason for the way Pres¬
ident Quezon participated in past
legislative affairs. “The Constitu¬
tion, he elucidated, "purposely
surrounded the Chief Executive
with great prerogatives, not only
because the incumbent is the head
of the party to which all the mem¬
bers of the Legislature belong...
but also because he has always ta¬
ken the leaders and members of
the Legislature into his confidence
so that when recommendations are
made by him, they are already ex¬
pressive as much of executive as
of legislative policy."


TORRES ON THE
FORGOTTEN MAN
Roundly denouncing the in¬
different attitude of the govern¬
ment survey board towards his
labor department organization
plan, Secretary of Labor Torres
declared that "as far as the
masses are concerned, the ‘for¬
gotten man' is really forgotten,
that equality before the law as
far as the poor man is concern¬
ed is a pretty fiction, and that
there is a justification for the
restlessness and discontent of
the masses.”

DENIAL


ry HEN Fausto de los Santos, a
W married teacher in Naga,
Camarines Sur, Elementa¬
ry School, seduced a 15-year-old
girl pupil, President Quezon—des¬
pite an investigator’s report re¬
commending exoneration—i m m e¬
diately dismissed the wrongdoer
from his office last April 3rd and
also instructed the provincial fis¬
cal to prosecute him at once.
Evidently Venancio Baliad, of
Hinunangan, Leyte, was inspired by
the swift justice meted out by the
President. So he, too, made open
his grievance against Melecio Bel¬
tran, a Hinunangan teacher, for al¬
legedly seducing his daughter,
which bureau of education author-
ities believe the teacher did not
commit.
How Offense Was Committed
In his letters to the President,
one written in Visayan last Jan¬
uary 6, 1936, and another in Eng¬
lish last May 4th, 56-year-old Ba¬
liad revealed that his daughter Bri¬
gida, while a sixth grader in 1934-
1935 at the Hinunangan public
school, suffered a misfortune that
made her a mother last July 8,
1935.
At the first signs of misfortune,
Father Baliad investigated his

daughter and “bravely she told me

her teacher in Arithmetic, also car¬
pentry shop teacher. Why she ac¬
cepted the love of Mr. Beltran, a
married man, Brigida confessed
that she had been forced to on
threats of flunking if she wou'd
not surrender to his evil intentions.
Brigida was too young to offer suc¬
cessful resistance, and the offense
was committed in a public edifice—
the carpentry shop building.” She
went there because Beltran told her
to help him correct test papers in
Arithmetic.


The father complained to the
school authorities, but Principal
Pedro Gilang, after conducting an
investigation last March 5, 1935,
forgot to file a report, for which
he was later on reprimanded. Ap-
prised by Baliad’s telegram, Mr.
Orville A. Babcock, Leyte division
superintendent, ordered Supervising
Teacher Celestino Elefano to con¬
duct another investigation. From
then, Baliad said he did not re¬
ceive any result of the investi¬

sents to some high government of¬
ficial or of giving a reception in
his honor was last May IIth or¬
dered stopped by Pres. Quezon.
Against The Law
Section 688 of the Administra¬
tive code provides that "it shall be
improper for an officer or emplo¬
yee to make a donation or present
any gift of substantial value to an
official to whom he is subordinate
or to solicit or receive a contribu¬
tion from other officers or emplo¬
yees in the Government service for
the making of such donation or
gift. It shall likewise be improper
for any official to accept any do¬
nation or gift as aforesaid offered
or presented to by any person or
persons in the Government service
subordinate to himself.”
For years the practice has been
tolerated by government employees
for fear of losing their jobs if they
did not “cough up with the dough”
like any good employee. But evi¬
dent'y some did not want to be bull¬
dozed any longer and, like the pro¬
verbial worm, turned.
The result was President Que¬
zon’s Executive Order No. 8 which
reads, in part:
Presidential Order
“Whereas my attention has
been called to the fact that
some chiefs of bureaus and
the supervisory staff indulge
in the practice of collecting
contributions from employees
of their bureaus for the pur¬
pose of making presents to
some high government offi¬
cials or to celebrate some spe¬
cial event personal in nature;
“Whereas, this practice, be¬
sides being highly reprehensi¬


ble, is a heavy tax on the
small-salaried employee is con¬
ducive to servi-ity and syco¬
phancy, and contravenes the
provision of Section 688 of the
Administrative Code;
“Now, therefore, I, Manuel
L. Quezon, President of the
Philippines, by virtue of the
powers in me vested by law,
direct, as is hereby directed,
the immediate discontinuance
of this practice, and any chief
of bureau, or any of his subor¬
dinates, who under any guise
or pretense asks of any emplo¬
yee of his department any con¬
tribution for any purpose
without previous approval of
the corresponding department
head, will be summarily dis¬
missed from the service.”
Refuse To Talk
So deep has the fear rooted in
bureau employees that they would
not admit the existence of the prac-
tice in the bureaus where they
work, when they knew they were
talking to a press representative.
Only when assured that their
names and those of the bureaus
would not be mentioned did they
consent to talk. However, former


bureau employees squealed.
“We did not have any choice
when the collection hat was passed
around," said a retired employee
who had worked in three different
bureaus. “It was always made to
appear that these contributions had
the sanction of the bureau head.
Whether he approved of it or not,
we had no chance to know. We
were told the money was for a ban¬
quet or party in honor of some of¬
ficial in the department above us.
More often than not, we did not
attend those social functions. It is
better to lose P1 or P2 than your
job, you know."
Bureau officials who wanted to
court the favor of their higher-ups
usually started these contribution
movements. At times the official
so honored would not forget those
who were responsible for the affair,
rewarded them for past favors but
forgot the underdogs who shoulder-
ed the bulk of the burden.
"Give Anything You Want"
Another former bureau under¬
dog jocose'y said it is unfair to
stop the racket. “It is unfair to us
who were victimized,” he said.
“There should be equality of treat¬

ment.” This former public servant
who now has a fine job in a pri¬
vate firm explained that they had
not been 'forced' to pay. “The fel¬
low delegated to collect,” he said,
"simply came around holding a list.
At the top were the signatures of
the higher-paid employees and op-
posite their names were amounts
varying from P2 to P3. The contri¬
bution col'ector would simply say,
‘The chief told us to ask for your
help. Just give anything you want."
“That was it: the chief had ask-
ed for our help—any amount we
wanted to give. But we could not
put P0.20 under those big figures
above. It simply did not fit. So,
forgetting that we were receiving
₱40 00 or less, we put down ₱l and
sweated profusely after that.”
It was gathered that these con¬
tributions were collected mostly
when a high bureau or department
official was promoted or appointed.
Then the favor-seekers started
their rounds.
Most-Victimized Employees
A lady teacher from the province,
who is vacationing in Manila,
claimed that bureau employees do
not have an idea of how far this
contribution racket can be carried.
"“I do not know whether President
Quezon’s ruling includes us teach¬
ers, she said, "but in case it does
not, something ought to be done to
have us under its scope. It is true
we do not contribute for the bene¬
fit of high bureau or department

Son Enlists in the Army--
Mother Commits Suicide


woman was his (Salas’) own wife,
Eulalia Virtudes. Maria Salas,
daughter of the dead woman, and
her father Paulino stated that the
deceased was missing since the
night before. The daughter ex¬
p'ained that her mother, before she
left the previous evening, even
stated that she would prefer to die
ahead of her son Jorge who at the
time was stranded in Mambajao,
Oriental Misamis, and had asked
his parents for money so he could
come home.
It appears that the suicide’s
favorite child was Jorge, an only
son, although there are two other
children, both girls. The old wo¬
man began to worry about Jorge
when last April, against the advice
and pleadings of his mother, Jorge
enlisted for the army as required
by law. She had worried over him
ever since.


Jorge increased his mother’s
worries when on May 6th he left
for Mambajao, Misamis, to look for
work. In spite of the fact that his
departure was known to his mo¬
ther, she had given him money for
fare, she must have taken this de¬
parture and separation to heart.
And when one week later, on May
12th, the mother received a letter
from Jorge that he needed money,
the poor woman could not stand it
any longer and made the remark,
which nobody in her household
took seriously, that she wanted to
die. It was about 7:30 p.m. on
May 13th that the household miss¬
ed the old woman. A search for
her proved futile. The next morn¬
ing Mr. Galicia found her dead.
The authorities made an investi¬
gation and concluded, in the ab¬
sence of signs of violence, that Eu¬
lalia Virtudes committed suicide.

Typical of the complaints re¬
ceived by  , which led this
weekly to make an investigation,
was the letter received last May
IIth from Mr. Lucio Y. Asensi of
Hinunangan, Leyte, requesting
that the legality of an association
soliciting members and contribu¬
tions be looked into.
"I am tempted to suspect,”
said Mr. Asensi, “that this is
more of a racket than anything
else, working under the guise of a
promise to contribute funds for
the national defense program of
the country.”
And typical of the replies of the
city fiscal’s office to previous que¬
ries of the above nature referred
by   to that office:
“In reply to your letter of April
27, 1936, I regret my inability to
answer your query because the
City Fiscal is not authorized by law
to render opinions on legal ques¬
tions propounded by private citi¬
zens. (Sgd.) Gervasio Diaz, City
Fiscal."


Y NDER the benevo'ent cloak
of mutual aid and coopera¬
tion, there are now several
corporations operating in Manila
and the provinces which are open¬
ly skinning people and laughing at
our toothless laws at the same
time. Some of them have so per¬
fected their nefarious schemes
that, barely a few months after
starting their rackets, they have
grossed more than P50,000 on their
illicit ventures.
The credulous, impressed by big
downtown offices, readi'y believe
these enterprises to be on the level

and are turned into easy victims.
Many, lured by promises of sky-high
profits, parted with their money and
are now complaining. But it was
only last week that the city fiscal’s
office started doing active prose¬
cution. Against the Philippine
Mutual Cooperative Society, Inc. a
complaint has been filed.
How Scheme Works
This corporation, with Vicente T.
Fernandez as president and Joaquin
Trinidad as treasurer and general
manager, registered itself with the
bureau of commerce only last
January 7, 1936, although it had
been doing business since November
14th of last year. It worked this
way:
Individuals are solicited to become
members of the association. Two
classes of memberships are offered:
Class O requiring an entrance fee of
P5.00, and Class S, P2.50. A member
is offered a benefit aid of P40 under
Class O and P20 under Class S, plus
a 10% commission, if he can bring
in 18 new members with paid-up fees
for their respective classes.
Under the P5.00 class, one must
secure 18 members paying P90 to the
corporation. If anyone of the 18
fails to pay his P5-fee, he does not
get his benefit payment and com¬
mission totalling P49.00. The 18 new
members paying, he gets P40 benefit
payment and P9 commission or P49,
but leaves behind another P5, his
new membership fee. Thus from the
original P95, the corporation makes
a clear profit of P46, excluding Pe¬
dro’s new membership fee of P5.00.
Where Process Increases
Now each of the 18 new members


must secure 18 other new fellows,
for his individual thread of the
scheme. Thus 324 are brought in,
worth P1,620 to the corporation, be¬
fore the first 18 get their benefit
aids. And the 324 members must
bring in 5,832 new names turning
over P29,160 before they get their
benefit aids. The process continues
indefinitely, the members increasing
by using 18 as multiplier.

WOU were young once, still
are or always have been.
A This may have nothing to
do with verse, but then it is dif-
ficult to ignore the general sus¬
picion that the urge to write
verse has something to do with
youth. At any rate, experience
and observation have convinced
us, almost, that here in the Philip-
pines, at least, those who dabble
in "lilting soft cadences" are
mostly those still in their 'teens or
early twenties and those who, by
either heredity or preference, do
not seem to graduate from adole¬
scence. But as we were saying,
you were young once, still are or
always have been. Whether you
will a'ways be or not does not
concern us.
We would like to add, however,
that we believe youth should not be
considered a handicap. Nor is it to
be made light of. In any endeavor,
there is a stage of apprenticeship
that must be lived through. Start-
ing young, we at least have the
strengthening assurance of an ear¬
lier graduation into maturity.
Browning and Bryant began scrib¬
bling verses early in life. Poe pub¬

And so we
suggest that if at first you do not
seem to be making any headway
because of what you suspect to be
editorial inaptitude, you should re¬
member that Browning wrote

that two-thirds of Wordsworth

them.
Well, we were young once and
we thought we could be immortal
like, say, Poe, Stevenson or Chris¬
tina Rossetti (they were among
our early acquaintances). We re¬
call having begun by inditing some
dubious verses dedicated to our Al¬
ma Mater and succeeding in squeez¬
ing them into our high school paper.
Drunk by that initial success, we
tried to give more responsible
quarters a chance to discover us.
But it was not until after many
years of trying that we finally
broke into print in some reputable
magazine. Before that we have
begun to entertain the growing con¬
viction that literary editors were
smug individuals or nothing more
than simpletons who could not tell
trash from true works of art.
And now, we work in an office
where we are given a chance to pe¬
ruse the stuff would-be poets turn
in. Our literary editor being away
we did a little meddling and discov¬
ered that there are lines, stanzas
even poems which could be redeem¬
ed from complete oblivion with a
little patchwork here and there.
We shall call these merely verses,
not poetry, lest we be accused of
pretension to higher things. We
are, however, cheered with the
knowledge that not a few metrical
pieces that now fall under the dig-
nified name of poetry were origin¬
ally considered verse. These that
we quote from our contributors—
who knows?
Consider this one from a poem
Ildefonso Flor.
contributed by
Musico of Jones, Romblon. It
surges first with defiance then
throbs with resignation:
Heave forth your strongest waves
O sea,
Your strongest heave on nie;
What if I break on rocks, you
see,
I’m not afraid of thee.
Of day and night and joy and
grief,
And song I’ve had my fill;
Now that I hang, a yellow leaf,
Why must I linger still?
Of the inquietude of a dying
sinner’s mind we have not the
slightest idea. Guillermo D. L.
Fernandez writes in verse what he
imagines it must be like:
Commotion disrupts the lower¬
ing skies
Heavy-laden with rain—biting.


The winds, drunk, roar in mad¬
ding combat
Hurling bolts at one another,
Swelling mighty oceans and dash¬
ing them
On rugged shores in piercing de¬
tonations;
And 'round his bed distorted
shadows, weird phantonis,
Dancing tongues of fire swirl in
mad procession...
Love is an ageless subject in
verse and in song. So much has
been written about it already, how¬
ever, that fresh attempts to exp’oit
the subject have become the bane
of many a reader’s life. In our

A developed in the majority of
local tourists and vacationists
contempt for whatever other Phil¬

lands which, for novelty and ex¬
hilarating change, can hardly be
duplicated in foreign countries.
Among these vacation spots is
that group of islets, called the
“Hundred Islands."
Lying between longtitude 16"-10"
and 16"-15’ and latitude 120"-2’ and
120"-4 in the Lingayen Gulf are a
sprinkling of tiny islands known to
all big-game fishermen as the
“Hundred Islands.” The group is
really composed of more than 300
large and small islands, as well as
mere rocks that barely afford foot-
ing to marine birds when the sea
becomes slightly ruffled.
Thousands and thousands of years
ago, when our country was still a
part of the Asiatic mainland, there
is said to have existed a large act¬
ive volcano in constant eruption on
the coast of what is now known as
Lingayen Gulf.
The sinking of the earth’s sur¬
face below the sea final'y separated
three groups of land from the con¬
tinent: the Japan, the Philippine,
and the Bornean groups.
The slow seeping of water into
the heart of the ancient volcano re¬
sulted in a terrific explosion and
earthquake. The Eastern side of
the crater burst open, and the sea,
rushing in, extinguished the volca
no, leaving in its place the small
but picturesque harbor of Sual.
Islands Are Formed
The accompanying series of
earthquakes broke into small pieces
a large promontory near Barrio Lu¬
cap, municipality of Alaminos,
Pangasinan, resulting in the for-
mation of the “Hundred Islands.
Taking a launch from Lucap, the
port of Alaminos, in a north-East¬
erly direction, one reaches after
one hour the northernmost point
of the group, a towering mass of
wind-swept, wave-lashed jagged
rocks. Turning southward for
about 100 to 150 meters, one arrives
at “Cathedral Cave," a hollowed out
large rock. Its grandeur and
unique shape reminds one of the
interior of a ruined cathedral.
During high tide, if the sea is calm,
the launch may enter this cavern if
exceptional care is taken; but as
there is no safe landing place, vis¬
itors are cautioned not to attempt
to land.
Fisherman’s Paradise
The surrounding waters being
rather populated with playful deep¬
sea denizens, it is considered un¬
wise to indulge in aquatic gambols.
Recently, however, our beloved


Behind the excursionists in the above phetagraph looms ane of the "Hundred
Islands" in Lingayen Gulf. Note the luxuriant vegetation.


Commissioner Frank Murphy, either
as a dare to the friendly sharks,
jewfish, and barracudas in the vic-
inity of “Cathedral Cave," or in a
moment of p'ayful exuberance,
jumped into the water, thereby giv.
ing all his companions the fright
of their lives. He was prompt'y
hauled out. The gasp of relief let
out by all the members of the com¬
mittee raised a tidal wave that
threatened to wash away the other
islands.
Continuing south for about 250
to 300 meters, one finally reaches
the celebrated “Cueva Milagrosa,"
the entrance to which is accessible
only at low tide and during a calm,
being a small narrow hole about
15 to 2 meters in diameter during
high tide. The interior of the cave
is a gorgeous riot of colors and as
magnificent and unforgettable as
its exterior is devoid of any attrac¬
tion. Every year hundreds of tour¬
ists make trips to this cave for the
sole purpose of writing their names
on the walls. The wonderful for-
mation of stalactites and stalag¬
mites makes this cave worthy of its


Sketch showing a pertlon of the Hundred


name.
Quezon Island”
Continuing southward, one comes
to “Quezon Island," a beautiful is¬
land with a dazzling white beach of
coral sand, the favorite landing
place of all picnickers.
This island, because of its pop¬
ularity and beauty, was named in
honor of President Quezon. It is
an island of refuge easily accessible
from all sides. It was baptized
many years ago but was “con¬
firmed" on April 27, 1936, by His
Excellency, the President, in per¬

"Murphy Island'
To the right of “Quezon Island
is a larger island that was also bap¬
tized and confirmed as "Kiko Mur¬
phy” by the High Commissioner
himself. Unlike “Quezon Island,"
however, it is almost unapproach-
able due to the coral formation sur¬
rounding it.
There are other caves in the
group such as the "La Monja" and
the “El Fraile,” which are of min-
or importance due to their lack of
imposing beauty, but which are
worth-while visiting for the sake
of comparison.
Crossing the main canal which
abounds in sharks and large game
fish—a fisherman’s paradise where
monster sailfish, huge jewfish, enor-
mous barracudas, and fighting mad
talakitok are as common as frisky
goats—one comes to the “Cueva
Virgen," a small cave with a key¬
hole entrance, which is worth-while
seeing.
Ducks, monkeys, reptiles, and
small song birds are practically the
only inhabitants of these pictures
que islands; only one island in the
entire group has fresh water, the
“Island of Camantilis."
The whole southern part of the
group, near the mainland, is cov¬
ered by a rugged mass of luxuriant
vegetation which is pleasing to the


eye. The cool breezes that constant-
ly sweep the islands help make the
Hundred Islands" an ideal spot for
vacationists and health seekers.
Modern Conveniences
At the Port of Lucap, about 100
meters from the shore, is the Hun¬
dred Islands Hotel, which is now
being modernized for the conven¬
ience of big-game fishermen. A
modern toilet system, shower baths,
cool breezy rooms, excellent cuisine,
and large comfortable verandas
from which a clear view of the
“Hundred Islands" may be had, are
being incorporated into it.
Launches are available by reser¬
vation and small native dug-outs
for enterprising followers of Izaac
Walton who prefer "still fishing"
may be had any time.

forced to give for the entertain¬

visit our districts is many times
more than what bureau workers

It is a fact that visiting school
superiors are not averse to being

the poor maestros. The principal

when the affair is being given in

pions in the Filipino inter-club bas¬
ketball tournaments, winning the
three-legged Duga trophy (it cost
P64.00) and all other trophies of-
fered for basketball contests.
And, if only to prove their super¬
iority further, they also defeated the
Federal All-Star (American team)
champions in Chicago recent y. The
encounter was unusually thrilling
and kept spectators on their toes
all the time as the score seesawed
constantly. It finally stood at 29
to 27 in favor of the Cebu team!
Secret of Victory
Masterly and aggressive perfor¬
mances of former Far Eastern
Olympic stars have given strength
to this powerful Cebu combination.
To it be’ongs Sal Cepeda, the
coach, who was once the pride of
the U.S. Navy in the sprints, and
whom the United States sent to the
World Olympics several years ago
as a star performer for the Amer¬
ican delegation in Europe. For a
profession, he is coaching girls"
track teams at Northwestern Univ¬
ersity, putting them in shape for
national and international competi¬
tions. Cepeda is from Cebu.
Ted Villarosa is another former
F. E. Olympic star. A product
of the Cebu High School, Chicago
knows him to-day as the quintet’s
high scorer.


ered in the Cebu High School, sent
to Japan with the Philippine Olym-
pic delegation and returning home
a hero, he suddenly realized that
Cebu was too quiet a place for him.
He is now here in Chicago with
us, sorting mails for Uncle Sam. In
between, as an enlisted man in the
Ilinois Naval Reserve, he has made
himself lightweight champion for
two successive years. He is man¬
aging the Cebu Club’s team, and
excels here as a middle distance
runner.
About the other fellows. Ateneo
de Manila once pinned its hopes for
basketball laurels on P. Lynn Gar¬
ces, an old-time col'ege star. But
most aggressive of all Cebu athletes
is Roy Baliguat, a well-known vol¬
leyball player in his high school
days. Gerardo Alfafara is captain
of the basketba’l team, and another
Alfafara (Nick) is good at scor¬
ing.

LACK OF FUNDS MAY CAUSE CLOSING
OF MANY STATIONS DEVOTED
TO AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTS


Secretary of Agriculture Eulogio Ro¬
driguez: says mast of our aarcultural
experiment stations are a total failure.
w Fanyone were in quest of a
place under the sun where he
Awould likely see wild grasses
growing as tall as, or even taller
than, agricultural p’ants, he need
not go to the half-tilled, neg¬
lected farms of our indolent farm¬
ers in the provinces. Our govern¬
ment agricultural experiment sta¬
tions, two of which are in Manila,
would be just the place to see.
This is not fiction. Secretary
Rodriguez of the department of
agriculture and commerce has been,
for the past few months, investigat-
ing quietly and evaluating the tan¬
gib'e contributions each of these
stations has made.
Shocking to Taxpayers
The result of Secretary Rodri¬
guez’ secret investigations should
be shocking to every taxpayer.
Said the Secretary: “Most of
these agricultural experiment sta¬
tions are a total failure. Many of
them are in a most unsatisfactory
condition and to a certain extent
also a discredit to the government
and a shame to the people who pay
the taxes that maintain them.
Grasses in some of these stations
grow taller than the seedlings.”
No less than President Quezon
has expressed the belief that many
of these experiment stations have
outlived their usefulness as such.
He has instructed Budget Director
Marabut not to make any appro¬
priation for these if he should find
that such agencies of the govern-
ment no longer deserve government
support.
There are many reasons behind
the decision of President Quezon
and Secretary Rodriguez to close
experiment stations.
Financial Reasons
Foremost among these is finan¬
cial. “The Commonwealth govern¬
ment is confronted with a number
of problems necessitating huge
outlays," according to Secretary


Rodriguez. "Ways have to be de¬
vised, therefore, to lighten the fi¬
nancial burden of the government.
As our experiment stations are
costing us too much money, we
deem it wise to close some of them
and maintain no more than a few
regional ones.” Not all experiment
stations, according to Secretary Ro¬


driguez, would be closed. He pro¬
poses to have one regional experi¬
ment station in the Cagayan valley,
one in Central Luzon, one in the
Bicol region, one in the Visayan Is¬
lands, and one in Davao.
About the financial side. In 1924,
huge outlays were provided by the
legislature for experiment stations.


These stations were set up all over
the Philippines. But those were
prosperity years and securing gov¬
ernment appropriations was an ea¬
sy matter. But the government in
recent years started curtailing
some of its activities, leaving the
bureau of plant industry with mea¬

FHEY tell him of her, and he
is surprised and hurt. Just
A
how much, how little or how
great, he could not tell. The hurt,
mean.
They say to him: Remember Ro¬
gella? You know, the girl who
went to school here and was once
elected the most popular girl in
town. Remember? (And here he
wants to say: Remember her, re¬
member her? Are you asking
me...! But he keeps quiet.) And
they continue: She’s to be married
within the month... (And here he
cannot think of anything to say,
cannot think of anything with
which to interrupt them.)
They tell this to him in a tone
they will use to tell the news to
anyone else. They do not know
(because there is no sign in his
face) that he is surprised and
huit.
And although he cannot say any¬
thing to them, he remembers her,
has always remembered her since
the day she went away to live in
her home town up north. While


others called her Rolling, Hilling or
Elling, he had a name for her: Ro.
But he had not made her aware of
this, he had never uttered it to her.
Once he wrote a story which ap¬
peared in their club journal and
called the girl in it Ro. To him she
has always been Ro.
But that was long ago—that
story and that new nickname for
her. So long ago he associates them
now with heavy school textbooks
and club meetings and the new
bicycle he had used to go to and
from classes. And she left some
four years ago. And since then he
had not seen her except once, and
then only in the papers.
When she left he thought of some


day meeting her again. She would
be as beautiful as when he had last
seen her, and already accomplished.
And he would be older of course.
Already a man. He would come up
to her and say with a firm, brave
voice (should it tremble, he would
resolve to make it firm): Do you
remember?
 AKIA means wooden shoes in
 most of the dialects of the Phil-
ippines. But to him, they hold a
meaning much more weighty than
that. They mean more than the
clacking sounds they make when
you walk in them.
They always
mean to him that afternoon when
they were very noisy in a room


waiting for their faculty adviser
before going on with the more ser¬
ious business of conducting a club
meeting
And then she came in wooden
shoes (that made staccato noise on
the cement floor) because it was
muddy and wet outside with the
morning rain. She was a new
pupil and he had not seen her be¬
fore, and now he could just look at
her and ask himself who she was,
what grade she was in, although he
knew he could not tell. And then
Tiago who sat beside him, saw his
lingering look fastened upon her as
upon an idol, and in some curious
manner of reasoning common to
small boys decided he. Nardo, was
in love with her.
Bakia, bakia, bakia," Tiago
cal'ed, looking at him.
He looked at Tiago and said,
“Stop it Tiago," although he didn’t
mind Tiago going ahead and calling
him bakia and thinking he was in
love with the new girl. "Bakia,
Nardo, bakia,” Tiago called on, look¬
ing first at the girl then at him.
And he just let Tiago alone al¬
though when the girl looked at him
he could not look back at her.
Tiago had the whole room soon
interested and the crowd looked at
Nardo and began giggling and say¬
ing things. But loudest was Tiago
who kept on calling, bakia, bakia,
as if it were a particularly mean¬
ingful word. And Nardo could see
the new girl looking out of the
window as if she were not aware
of the stir she had created, and he
somehow wished she’d come up to
him and accuse him point-blank of
starting all commotion.
Then all at once, there was a
hush, an abrupt descent from noise
to silence, and he looked at the
yawning doorway and there was
Mr. Valera looking very angry and
annoyed. He went up to Tiago,
and, taking him by the ear, pulled
him steadily to the door. At the


door Mr. Valera said, “Get out,"
and you could see he was really an¬
gry. "And stay out.” And poor
Tiago went out like a pet dog who
had been caught at something for¬
bidden and soundly thrashed.
At home, Nardo took down his
mother’s wooden slippers and turned
them around in his hands for some
time. But they did not appear near
enough as beautiful as the new
girl’s which had red wooden soles,
blue leather tops, and pretty violet
trimmings...
And from that day Nardo thought
there was no one near as beautiful
as she, not even excepting his
young lady teacher in English who
was pretty, too, but had not the

soft waves of Rogella’s jet black
hair nor the laughing lights that
now and then lit up her dark eyes
nor the beautiful turned up corners
of her mouth.
FN'HE school year came to a close;
and when it opened again
Nardo was a grade higher. That
year was his last of the interme¬
diate grades. At the end of that
year, they would crowd a narrow
platform in their best suits and
blush when their names were called
and they handed rectangular pieces
of imitation sheepskin rolled up
and tied with silky red ribbon.
But about the middle of the year,
there was something else as import-
ant as graduation. It was the
inter-district declamation contest.
Every year towards the middle of
the term, there would be a try-out
and some one who proved himself
better than the rest of the contest-
ants would be choosen to represent
the entire school.
One day his teacher in English
cal'ed Nardo to her, and she gave
him a book opened at a section
marked with pencil. “Here Nardo,
memorize this," she said. She did
not ask him if he wanted to try for
the contest. She merely gave him
the selection and told him to me¬

locality and employs local talent.
They usually write a little playlet,
get local actors to play in it, then
film it on the stage of the local
theatre in one week and show the
finished product in the same thea¬
tre the next.
One Mr. Carter Barron, the di¬
vision manager of the Fox (Loew)
Theatre in Washington, knows of
the Senator’s love for the acting
art, so he was smart enough to grab
the Senator in plenty of time, for


the lead in “It happened in Wa¬
shington," the film to be produced.
Once given the script, the Sen¬
ator busied himself and studied his
part avidly. He spent days rehears¬
ing privately. His role was that
of a schoolmaster. At first they
had a terrible time trying to con¬
vince Sen. Ashurst to give up the
idea of wearing an elegantly tail¬
ored morning suit, pearl gray vest,
spats, etc..... they argued and
begged him to give up the ensem¬
ble, telling him that it was too
dressy for the role. After all the
pleadings and the arguments, he
finally consented to wear a more
modest blue serge business suit....
BUT he retained the wing collar,
nobody could get him to give it
up.
On the day of the “takes” the
Senator made his appearance with
the rest of the actors and did his
role quite fairly.
There is just a faint touch of
irony in that title of the film....!

ger funds.
The result is that the activities
in some experiment stations were
stopped until they became, as Sec¬
retary Rodriguez said “... a discre¬
dit to the government.” Some sta¬
tions could not function properly
for lack of funds. Others are with-
out the necessary agronomists to
undertake the necessary research
work.
“What,” Secretary Rodriguez
asks, "is the use of keeping so ma¬
ny when we cannot keep all of them
properly? Don’t you think that it
would be better for us to have only
a few but properly maintained sta¬
tions, than too many but not func-
tioning as they should function?”
Costly Adornments
Agricultural experiment stations,
seed farms, propagation stations,
and provincial nurseries in general
have never been properly appreciat¬
ed by the majority of our farmers.
To a certain extent and in some
places, they are looked upon as
“costly adornments.” Agronomists
in experiment stations try to de¬
monstrate to farmers the best ways
of raising crops but in raising
these crops in their stations, they


use costly implements and costly
fertilizers which small farmers
cannot afford to buy. The result
is that our small farmers and the
college-trained government experts
never understand each other. In
the majority of cases, only student-
excursionists visit these stations
and make of them no more than
picnic grounds.
Helpful
There is this, nevertheless, to be
said of these experiment stations
into which so much government
money has flowed. Through the
aid of these experimental stations
plants of economic va’ue from
other countries have been introduc¬
ed in many provinces. In regions
where only one kind of crop is
grown, experiment station officials
demonstrated to farmers that other
crops could be grown profitably.
Thus, it is pointed out that in Nue¬
va Ecija, where only rice is grown
before, Bermuda onions and cotton
are being raised profitably due to
a campaign initiated by station of¬
ficials there. To-day, many farm¬
ers in that province are raising
onions and cotton under the guid¬
ance of experiment stations person¬
nel. Seedlings, too, are grown and
raised in these stations and distri¬

buted to the people free or at no¬
minal prices. In places where there
are experiment stations and nurse¬
ries, as in Silang, Cavite, it is noted
that backyards are always crowded
with fruit-bearing trees.
At the present time, when our
leaders are preaching the theory of
crop diversification, there is pro¬
bably no other agency of the gov-
ernment that can undertake the
campaign and help the farmers di¬
versify their crops better than ex¬
periment stations. In the same
manner, experiment stations have
found ways and means to increase
Philippine crop production and
lessen the cost of production of
both agricultural and horticultural
crops. Research in these stations
has devised effective methods to
preserve the longevity of seeds.
Promising plant immigrants of
high economic value have been pro¬
pagated in these stations and dis¬
tributed to farmers. Investigations
are also being conducted by these
stations as to the most economical
methods of managing farms. The
results of their investigations have
been very he pful to farmers.
Ours is essentially an agricultu¬
ral country and it is believed that
the closing of some of these sta¬
tions would mean a drawback on
our agriculture.

morize it. He should come to her
regularly, too, and she would tell
him how to make the right deliv¬
ery. And he could read her implied
confidence in him and he coud
merely say, “Yes, ma’am, I will."
For days he went seriously at the
task until one day he had every line,
every single emphatic word marked
in his head ready for delivery any


moment.
The day came. They were in the
same room of the building where
they once held a club meeting that
afternoon he first saw her. There
were the three teachers who were
to act as judges, the rest of the
faculty, the half-dozen or so con¬
testants, and the roomful of curious
pupils.
He was the third to be asked to
stand before the whole room and re-
cite his piece, something about the
wreck of a stout ship called the
Hesperus and about the brave
daughter of a brave captain. (You
hear this piece recited now and
then in school programs, and he
personally cannot hear it now with-
out remembering that afternoon of
the try-out.)
He bowed like the rest, and
cleared his throat, as if to free it
of anything that might obstruct the
easy flow of the poem’s inspired
passages. He called out the title
of the piece. The Wreck of the
Hesperus. Like the stout ship in
the beginning, he weathered the
first two stanzas without effort. At
the beginning of the third, he saw
Rogel a come into the room, doing
her best not to make a sound or
disturb him 'in any way.
When he saw her, he told him-
self, I have to do uncommonly well
now, I have to do better now. He
was suddenly conscious of the
judges looking at him closely, of
every pair of eyes on him, of how
he should give forth this line or
that portion of a line. But above
all he was conscious of her being
in the room, and that he had to do
uncommonly well now.
And then he was conscious of
tripping over his lines as if, like
the Hesperus he was telling them
about, he had been struck a mortal
wound. The silence in the room
was tense. Then some indelicate
fool of a girl giggled softly and he
knew he cou d never deliver the last
line.
He vainly tried remember¬
ing the next line and could only
manage to stammer... he dared not
look in her direction.
He took his seat without reach¬
ing the end of his piece, and those
who hadn’t read the poem never
knew what happened to the cap-
tain’s daughter. It seemed years
before they announced the next
contestant and he could hide in his
seat while everyone was paying at¬
tention to the new candidate. He
felt miserable asking himself what
she could be thinking of him. And
when he felt his teachers soft hand
on his shoulder he could only bend
his head lower.
N high school, Nardo did not see
A much of her. He kept hoping
she’d be promoted during some

MONG the many questions
which were asked Mrs.

when these social workers ar¬
rived in Seattle last April 16th
was: Why not send to America
more Filipino women to act as
ministering angels to the lonely
Filipino bachelors?
Without mincing her words, Mrs.
Pecson replied: “When you make
yourselves worthy of their affec-
tion, they will come to you.” It
was hastily explained by the Fili¬
pino youths that the greater object
they had in mind is the straighten¬
ing up of the social conditions that
are now becoming a despair to both
Filipinos and Americans abroad.
For instance, Filipino women could
help save the victims of gambling
dens and dance halls.

Dislike is Regional
In most towns of the Bicol region,
the Japanese are not regarded with
favor. This is especialiy noticeab e,
considering that the store-keeping
Chinese at the corner has a starry¬
eyed Bicolana to help him in the
store. The dislike can be imputed
to newspaper accounts of Japanese
political exploits, of their world-
wide material expansion, and also,
domesticaliy speaking, because of
their different manner of living.
The last reason most often broke
marital unions between Japanese
husbands and native wives. As
graphically told by a native woman
of Guinobatan, Albay, who deserted
her Japanese husband’s pretentious
house for the nipa one of her pa¬
rents:
Hubby Is Miser
“It does not mean that when one
is well provided for she can be truly
happy,” she reasoned out. "No¬
thing makes a wife more happi'y
conscious of her marital life than
when she is made to hold the fami¬
ly purse and allowed to run the
home in her own way.
“But my. Japanese husband is
different—he is a miser! He holds
the cash box and keeps an inventory
of all things bought for family con¬
sumption or use. What’s irritating,
he appears to know best when it
comes to buying kitchenware or re¬
furbishing a room. He simply
doesn’t trust me with them.”
A Drunken Husband
is a prized trait


look minor imperfections and short-
comings in the household. But a
childless wife in Legaspi, Albay,
left her husband because:
“He is thoughtless, inconsiderate.
He tften comes home drunk—a
grouchy, sinister figure—and slams
the door and finds fault with every
thing. Nobody can live with one
of his kind for long, however care¬
fully patient she may ihe."
Maltreats His Wife
In Naga, Camarines Sur, s Ja¬
panese candy confectioner has aan
A bay woman for a wife. The lat¬
ter’s parents and relatives were
quite disgusted with the sorry turn
the marital union has taken.
“She cannot blame us,” they told
the writer. “We were opposed to
the marriage, but she would not
mind us. Now she laments her ut¬
ter helplessness when her Japanese
husband comes home heavily drunk


and with his temper on edge, or
when he openly flirts with the sales¬
girls at their store.
“Twice or thrice he lost his head
and ma treated her, simply because
she made purchases without his
knowledge. Her father tried to
smooth out the difference, but it
only made the husband more fu¬
rious."
Not Given To Affections
Japanese husbands do not seem
to be demonstrative with respect to
affections, judging from what a
couple of Bicolana wives have said
about their foreign husbands. Lit¬
tle tokens of feminine love which
have given the wives no small
amouist of delight, are regarded by
them lightly.
“Whenever I bought him presents
which I considered he would be
pleased about," said one, “he would
exclaim, ‘My! Why did you buy

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
The death of Hareld Monkhouse, a London
Invalid, has heen the subject of an inquea
at which is determined that the dead man
was willfully murdered through poisoning by
some person or persans unknawn. A search
of the Mankhouse residence fallows. A hot
tle which the police officers believe had con¬
tained poison is found in the library which
is under the care of Wallingford, the dead
man’s secretary. Another such bottle i
found in Madeline Norris’ room. Nothing is
found in Mrs. Monkhouse’s chamber or in
the servants' quarters.

THORNDYKE SPEAKS BLUNTLY
y HEN I had entered the
little sitting room and shut
the door, I turned to Bar¬

ty what she had to say to me. But
for a while she said nothing, stand¬
ing before me silently, and look¬

ing at me with a most disquieting
expression. All her calm self-
possession had gone. I could read
nothing in her face but alarm and
dismay.
“It is dreadful, Rupert!” she ex¬
claimed, at length, in a half-whis¬
“It is like some awful dream:
er.
What can it all mean? I don’t care
to ask myself the question.
I shook my head, for I was in
precisely the same condition. I
did not dare to weigh the meaning
of the things that I had seen and
heard.
Suddenly, the stony fixity of her
face relaxed and with a little,
smothered cry she flung her arm
around my neck and buried her face
on my shoulder.
Forgive me, Rupert, dearest,
kindest friend," she sobbed. "Suf¬
fer a poor lonely woman for a few
moments. I have only you, dear
faithfu' one: only your strength and
steadfastness to lean upon. Before
the others I must needs be calm
and brave, must cloak my own fears
to support their flagging courage.
But it is hard, Rupert; for they see
what we see and dare not put it
into words. And the mystery, Ru¬
pert, the horrible shadow that is
over us all! In God’s name, what
can it all mean?”
“That is what I ask myself, Bar¬
bara, and dare not answer my own
question."
She uttered a low moan and clung
closer to me, sobbing quietly.
was deep’y moved, for I realized
the splendid courage that enabled
her to go about this house of hor
ror, calm and unafraid; to bear the
burden of her companions’ weak¬
ness as well as her own grief and
humiliation. But I could find noth-
ing to say to her. I could only of¬
fer her a silent sympathy, holding
her head on my shoulder and softly
stroking her hair while I wondered
dimly what the end of it all would
be.
Presently she stood up, and, tak¬
ing out her handkerchief, wiped her
eyes resolutely and finally.
“Thank you, dear Rupert,” she
said. "for being so patient with


me. I felt that I had come to the
end of my endurance and had to
rest my burden on you. It was a
great relief. But I didn’t bring
you up here for that. I
wanted
to consult you about what has to
be done. I can’t look to poor Tony
in his present state.
"What is it that has to be done?”
I asked.
“There is the funeral. That has
still to take place.
"Of course it has,” I exclaimed,
sudden’y taken aback; for amidst
all the turmoils and alarms, I had
completely lost sight of this detail.
‘I suppose I had better call on the
undertaker and make the necessary
arrangements.
‘If you would be so kind, Rupert,
and if you can spare the time. You
have given up the whole day to us
already."
'I can manage," said I. "And
as to the time of the funeral. I
don’t know whether it could be
arranged for the evening. It gets
dark pretty early."
“No, Rupert,” she exclaimed,
firmly “Not in the evening. Cer¬
tainly not. I will not have poor
Harold’s body smuggled away in
the dark like the dishonored corpse
of some wretched suicide. The
funeral shall take place at the pro¬
per time, if I go with it alone.
“Very well, Barbara. I will
arrange for us to start at the time
originally fixed. I only suggested
the evening because—well, you
know what to expect.
“Yes, only too well! But I refuse
to let a crowd of gaping sight-seers
intimidate me into treating my
dead husband with craven disres¬
pect."
"Perhaps you are right," said I
with secret approval of her decision,
little as I relished the prospect that
it opened. “Then I had better go
and make the arrangements at once.
It is getting late. But I am loath
to leave you alone with Madeline
and Wallingford."
“I think, perhaps, we shall be
better alone for the present, and
you have your own affairs to at¬
tend to. But you must have some


food before you go. You have had
nothing since the morning, and I
expect a meal is ready by now.”
"I don’t think I will wait, Bar¬
bara, I replied. “This affair ought
to be settled at once. I can get
some food when I have dispatched
the business.
She was reluctant to let me go.
But I was suddenly conscious of a
longing to escape from this house
into the world of normal things and
people; to be alone for a while with
my own thoughts, and, above all, to
take counsel with Thorndyke. On
my way out I cal ed in at the din¬
ing room to make my adieux to
Madeline and Wallingford. The
former looked at me, as she shook
my hand, very wistfully and I
thought a little reproachfully.
“I am sorry you have to go, Ru¬
pert,” she said “But you will try
to come and see us to-morrow,
won’t you? And spend as much
time here as you can.
I promised to come at some time
on the morrow; and having ex¬
changed a few words with Walling¬
ford, took my departure, escorted
to the street door by the two wo¬
men.
The closing of the door, sound-
ing softly in my ears, conveyed a
sense of relief of which I felt as¬
hamed. I drew a deep breath and
stepped forward briskly with a feel-
ing of emancipation that I con¬
demned as selfish and disloyal even
as I was sensible of its intensity.
It was almost with a sense of ex¬

Y Y ATIONAL defense instruc¬
tion is a good thing for our
L 4 young schoolboys. But trou¬
ble is, Italy has a similar idea and
see what she is now. As told by a
young Italian mother to Emily Taft
Douglas:
“But though a woman’s job is to
have babies, it is the state which
takes charge of them as soon as
they are out of the cradle. There
is no place here for your child¬
study groups, your Parent-Teacher
Associations or progressive edu¬
cation. The state determines eve¬
ry policy. In the first reader child-
ren learn a prayer which they re-
cite daily. The prayer asks God to
aid II Duce now and forever, for
the peace of Italy and of the world!
The school readers are filled with
anecdotes about Mussolini, calling
him the “Good Magician" and com¬
paring him to St. Sebastian. *a
Outside the schools, the only orga-
nizations which are permitted are
the Fascist. In them all the boys
drill, handle a rifle and sometimes
a machine gun. When I look at my
six-year-old “Wolf Cub" marching
off in his black shirt with a rifle
on his shoulder, I can see the next
war coming.”
* *
Margaret Sanger, famed birth-
control pioneer, found fertile
ground in India. As described by
Anna Jane Phillips:
“Leaders of Indian life have
sought her advice. Religious
groups, bound by tradition, have
leaped to their feet to denounce
her... But the women themselves,
from the thoughtful-faced progres¬
sive Maharani of Baroda to the
thin, early-aged women of the Bom¬
bay tenements, like the women of
the Western world have welcomed
her words as a key turning the
long-closed door of their freedom.
Gent'e, small of stature, with quiet,
resigned faces, these women each
had families ranging from three to
ten children. And each had a story
to tell of other children who had
died at birth or before they were
able to walk."


Dr. Edith How-Martyn gave lectures
on birth control in Manila and Malolos,
and Margaret Sanger in India.


Which reminds us: whatever
happened to the seeds sown here
last March by Dr. Edith How-Mar¬
tyn, directress of the International
Birth Control Bureau of London?
She gave birth control lectures be¬
fore Manila and Malolos women.

It’s no wonder Mohammedans
are changing their minds about po¬
lygamy. Said Sidi Adb-el-Aziz to
Vicente Sanchez Ocana:
“I have four wives and five con¬
cubines. Nine women in all. And
eighteen sons and daughters.
When I leave early in the morning
to go to the Mosque, Mesauda, my
first wife and her three sons come
to kiss me good-bye. I kiss them.
Then, my second wife, Halima and
her five children stand on tiptoes
and offer me their foreheads.
kiss them, too. Then Baya, the
third wife and her four little ones
lovingly surround me. I kiss them.
Afterward, I must kiss Safia, Lei¬
la and her child, Muny and hers,
Zohra and hers, Nadyema and hers
and Aziza and her child. That’s
twenty-seven kisses. When I re-
turn, it’s twenty-seven more. When
I leave for work, the nine women
and eighteen children line up again
at the door to say good-bye to me.

Any man who wants a perfect
wife should insist upon marrying
a woman who, if she has not been
wife-trained abroad, is at least pre¬
pared to model herself on the pat¬
tern to which majority of French-
women conform. The Frenchwo¬
man alone understands the art of
satisfying a man’s varying moods.
Her first consideration is to please
the male, and she does this by look¬
ing after his creature comforts as
perhaps no other woman does. Par¬
ticularly worthy of attention is her
insistence upon the cultivation of
wit and charm.—Sewell Stokes.
It’s different with our pretty
faces here. They place too much
reliance upon their looks, which
frequently display second editions

the thoughtless youth who, on his

car up to 40 when the speed limit


is 25, not the man who takes a
drink after 2 A.M., or the under¬
privileged moron who grabs a
pocketbook and runs; no, none of
these. It is the man who betrays
his trust. It is the man who know-
ingly, day after day and month af-
ter month, plays with the security
and happiness of others. It is the
man who blithely contracts debts he
knows down in his heart he cannot
pay, it is the lawyer who foments
litigation, the doctor who advises
unnecessary operations and profits
by them on account of arrange¬
ments with surgeons, it is the bank
official who lives for years beyond
his income knowing that he has al¬
ways the resources of other peoples"
income, it is the public official who
lends his name and prestige to en¬

People who would like to swim

kick and paddle with the aid of a

Making Greens
Appetizing


MOW to make every member
of the family, from kinder¬
II garten Nene to the head of
the househo d, eat vegetables with
relish is Mother’s problem. She
knows they are essential in the
diet but whenever they appear
green on the table the young ones
act like they are being given cas¬
tor oil and the older persons wear
a smirk throughout dinner. But
if in the preparation of vege'ables
attractiveness and palatableness
are considered, vegetables will
readily be eaten.
Below are some recipes which
may be of help:
Spinach Soup
Spinach (calumpay), 114 cups
(strained)

fat, without browning, five minutes.
Add spinach, bread, stock, salt, and
pepper and simmer for 30 minutes.
Make a smooth paste of the flour
to which is added a little cold milk;
add it to the milk and combine with
the soup. Cook five minutes longer

Teach Childrem
ROWLOLave


ROWN-UPS who have been
taught the value of money
 since childhood seldom, if
ever, get into financial difficul¬
ties. Their early training in in¬
come management may not total¬
ly solve money problems but it is
a good guarantee against getting
into tight fixes. Most of those who
burn money even when they can
ill-afford it, are those who in their
youth have not been trained to
handle money properly.
Instinctively, we attach signifi¬
cance to money. As a child ne liked
the clinking of coins. This natural
desire for money should not be
given a chance to develop in the
wrong direction.
Children need to be given a point
of view early on the use of money.
There are certain points concerning
the use of money which childrer
can understand almost as soon as
they can count. They quickly find
out that money is used to secure
certain services and goods and pri¬
vileges that they need and want.
They see that it will procure books,
pencils, shoes, and toys; that it will
provide for entertainment, and af¬
ford pleasure for other people.
Allowances need guidance, but
not close supervision. The amount
of the allowance and the responsibi¬
lities which it must cover need
careful planning with the chi d. It
is desirable that he shall begin as
early as possible to purchase some
necessary item in order that he


may learn what the purchasing po¬
wer of money is. For this reason,
school supplies, stockings, haircuts,
and other small items are made the
first responsibilities.
Individual chi dren will vary
greatly in the time at which the al¬
lowance can be started and the
amount of responsibility which
they can assume. It is certain,
however, that each year should
bring an increase in allowance with
increase in the needs which the al¬
lowance is to cover. In a short
time the child becomes interested
in the cost of various items for
other members of the family, and
with the right sort of direction he
may gradually become interested
in the fami y budget.
There is a difference, however,
between guidance and close super¬
vision. The former tends to help
the child to learn the value of mo¬
ney, whereas the latter tends to bar
the child from making his own de¬
cision—an essential part in learn¬
ing what money will buy. The in¬
stance of the seven-year-old child
who came rushing back after start-
ing for school because he had for¬
gotten his money for a school con¬
tribution, the remembering of
which was a point of great pride
with him, illustrates this point. He
hurried into the house with the re¬
mark, “I was not worried because I
knew it did not matter whether mo¬
ther was here or not, for I had my
own money."
Why should children save? There

‘The Doctor's Antiseptic'
GLYCO-THYMOLINE is well known and
generally used by doctors because of its
splendid antiseptic qualities which clean,
heal, and soothe the affected tissues.
GLYCO-THYMOLINE is particularly use¬
ful for the mouth, and throat passages,
and for internal use, and as a douche. Full
instructions, and dilutions for the various
uses are printed on each package.

is the tendency on the part of some
parents to urge that all money, es¬


pecially gifts acquired by the child,
go into savings. Since we are try-
ing to teach children to use money
wisely rather than to be hoarders,
saving everything does not insure
good spending in the future. Some
other parents should question why
a child shou'd save at all and whe¬
ther saving can have a profitable
meaning. Undoubtedly, the small¬
est child cannot be expected to go
beyond pleasure in filling his bank
and rattling it. Soon, however, a
child can acquire the idea of the
charm of deferred spending. If the
opening of his bank can be manag¬
ed to come at a time when he has
a long-felt want which can be met
with half the contents of the bank,
a very rea’ and powerful incentive
may be established.

With New Names
Trees planted in our plazas and
parks by visiting prominent persons
bear so many names that, in due
time, we won’t be able to tell their
proper names.
For instance, the narra tree has
been dubbed the Philippine Liberty
tree. The Almaciga, likewise, has
been named Murphy tree to honor
one of his visits somewhere. Pretty
soon many of our trees will be per¬

ed a moth-eaten story: no available
funds!
So the people of the neighbor¬
hood had to resign themselves to
the situation and, although costly,
have patronized the Metropolitan
Water supply, while the well re-
mains idle accumulating rust.
But here’s a discovery: the Pa¬
say municipal authorities have se¬
cured a radio set. The point is, if
they can buy a radio set and main¬
tain it, too, they could have also
managed to repair the artesian
well.
I would like to know if they
would let the valuable well in ques¬
tion rust away, all for want of a
little repair. I’m sure they would
not throw away their radio set for
want of say, a dial or a screw.

Assemblyman Kapunan’s plan
to make provincial governors and
municipal presidents appointive,
whi e laudable, is not a sure cure
for ills in the administration of
provincial and municipal govern¬
ments.
The defects are not found in the
system, but in the men. The ram-
pant maladministration in munici¬
pal and provincial governments are
due to the unprincipled political


tricksters who, because of their
power and money, keep on dominat¬
ing provincial politics. Thus they
discourage and eiminate compe¬
tent men from public offices.
The imperative remedy is to re-
strain and eliminate these political
fakirs, by amending the Election
Law so as to disqualify misfits,
however rich or influential they
may be. The Election Law should
also provide for punishment of an
individual or groups of individuals
who corrupt the electorate by coer¬


Edna St. Vincent Millay has been previously represented in this column
by at least three of her renownedly beautiful sonnets. Here are two more
to help you understand why she seems to be the most popular author among
our writers.
Sonnets
OH, think not I am faithful to a vow!
Faithless am I save to love’s self alone.
Were you not lovely 1 would leave you now:
After the feet of beauty fiy my own.
Were you not still my hunger’s rarest food,
And water ever to my wilaest thirst,
I would desert you—think not but I would!—
And seek another as I sought you first.
But you are mobile as the veering air,
And all your charms more changeful than the tide,
Wherefore to be inconstant is no care:
I have but to continue at your side.
So wanton, light and false, my love, are you,
I am most faithless when I am most true.
II
Iknow my mind and I have made my choice;
Not from your temper does my doom depend;
Love me or love me not, you have no voice
In this, that is my portion to the end.
Your presence and your favors, the full part
That you could give, you now can take away:
What lies between your beauty and my heart
Not even you can trouble or betray.
Mistake me not—unto my inmost core
I do desire your kiss upon my mouth;
They have not craved a cup of water more
That bleach upon the deserts of the south;
Here might you bless me; what you cannot do
Is bow me down, that have been loved by you.

Deputies Nof Needed
In Bukidnon and other Minda¬
nao provinces there exists a dupli¬
cation of work, hence a waste of
government money. This is the
existence of the office of deputy
governors!
This office is not necessary be¬
cause the work can be well carried
out and faithfully executed by the
presidents of each town or muni¬
cipal district. Doing away with
this position will mean money sav-
ed, which can be usefully spent for
more important government pro¬
jects.

Withouf Counsel Is Befter
In the justice of the peace court,
if it is a good practice for both
parties to be represented by coun¬
sel at a trial, it is far better if no
counsel appear at all on their be¬
half.
The presence of lawyers in a
trial makes it highly possible for
delicate technicalities to be raised
during the trial, with the result
that in some cases innocent men
are condemned while in other cases
guilty men are set free. The just¬
ice of the peace may be convinced
that the accused is guilty or not
guilty, as the case may be, but in
the face of a technicality of the
law, what else can he do but set
free the guilty man or consign the
innocent person to prison?
Where no counsel is present in a
trial, the presiding justice of the
peace is not hampered by technica¬
lities. He exercises full liberty to
weigh facts and evidence in an im-
partial manner, and is thus in the
ideal position of administering
justice as justice should be admi¬
nistered.

“Quints” Birthday
FNO-DAY the Dionne quintuplets
are celebrating their third an¬
niversary. The Quints were born
on May 28, 1934, to Mr. and Mrs.
Ovila Dionne, who lived near Cal¬
lander, Northern Ontario, Canada.
The names of the five little girls
are Yvonne, Annette, Cecile, Marie,
and Emilie. Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe


is the country doctor who brought
them into the world successfully
The Dionne Quintuplets are the
thirty-third set authentically re¬
ported in medical annals in the last
five hundred years, and are the
only set to survive. The little girls
are identical and weighed a to¬
gether less than ten pounds at birth.
Incidentally, “The Country Doc-
tor,” starring the famous Dionne
quintuplets and Jean Hersholt, is
now showing at the Metropolitan.

October. But year after year she
was still three grades below him.
In his first year in the new school,
he had a chance to take the four¬
year high school course in only
three years, but he had an idea he
wanted to be still there when she
graduated from the elementary.
It was in his first year that he
wrote that story and named the girl
in it after her. He did not name
the hero after himself, though he
meant to at first. He thought it
wou'd be a fine thing if he had it
published in one of the big maga¬
zines in Manila. But it did not pain
him much when it was politely re¬
turned to him. It was finally
printed in their club’s journal in
school. He didn’t know if she read
it; he knew now she hadn’t; and he
hadn’t the nerve to show it to her.
Although he didn’t see much of
her, he would spin on his bicycle
along the street where she lived on
Saturdays and Sundays hoping
she’d be at the window. When she
was, he wou dn’t look up as though
he wasn’t conscious of anyone
around that could interest him in
the least.
Semetimes Tirso, who had a
bicycle of his own, would accom¬
pany him. They were of about the
same age and were classmates.
Tirso had the idea that he was
in love with Rogella and that they
were rivals for her hand. When
she was looking, they’d perform
feats on their bicycles. Sometimes
one of them would get a fall and the
other would laugh triumphantly.
In all other things they were the
best of friends.
The year she graduated from the
intermediate, Nardo attended their
commencement, and saw her dance
a waltz in pink with eleven other
girls. Nardo never knew who the
other eleven were. And although
she appeared in three other parts
of the program and he saw her take
a gracious bow upon receiving her


certificate, he wished she had been
given more parts in the night’s
pregram.
In his senior year, he expected
her to be a freshman in the same
institution. But her parents had
other plans. They sent her to study
in an exclusive college in Manila.
And although in his senior year he
was a sort of a big shot he wasn’t
thrilled. He thought how differ¬
ent it would have been if she had
been there to notice his triumphs...
But she came home for the sum¬
mer vacation in time to be at their
commencement exercises. He saw
her in the front row while he read
the class prophecy. There was
again the old feeling that he had
to make good, to do uncommonly
well. But there was no flounder-
ing now as a result because he was
reading from the manuscript in his
hands.
That vacation he saw her now
and then. But everytime he found
himself near her, he could not say
a word to her. More than once he
wanted to say to her upon meeting
her on the street: You’re looking
gorgeous to-day, Ro (and he would
really mean it). I didn’t see you
at Charing’s last night, why? And
so on. But he could not even say,
Good morning, Miss Reyes. And
when they met they would just look
at each other and go on their way.
It’s funny, he thought,
FTER that summer, he found
Aout she and her brother,
Mando, were saiing on a certain
date for the City. He was going
to the City that June, too, and he
chose to get the same boat.
They were already in the boat
when he came up with his luggage
and things. Everybody who knew
him asked, "Are you sailing?’
“Yes, I’m,” he would say. He was
proud to say “Yes, I’m going.” He
saw Mando, her brother, and they
talked. He saw her, too, but he
was too timid to talk with her.
Sometimes he felt she was looking
at him, but when he looked up she
gould be looking elsewhere.
The days following were p'easant
enough. They did nothing but eat
and sleep and between these read
or look out on the blue sea or walk
the deck or listen to some lady play¬
ing the piano in the ship’s salon.
There was a tune about why the
sea seems bluer and the bird’s songs
sweeter when you’re looking at her.
She played it on the piano and he
has never forgotten it since. He
was on deck, at the rails listening
to her songs. He wondered, look¬
ing at the sea, if it had been bluer
on other occasions. He went into
the salon and sat down in a corner
and watched her play. And when
she had finished playing and he
could yet hear the tune in his ears,
he wanted to bring his palms to¬
gether and applaud and ask her to
please play again, please play and
never, never stop.
He watched her go out on deck,
and when he himself went there a
few minutes later he saw her pro¬

hilaration that I strode along, a
normal, unnoticed wayfarer among
ordinary men and women, enveloped
by no c'oud of mystery, overhung
by no shadow of crime. There was
the undertaker, indeed, who would
drag me back into the gruesome
environment, but I would soon have
finished with him, and then, for a
time, at least, I should be free.
I finished with him, in fact,
sconer than I had expected, for he
had already arranged the procedure
of the postpoued funeral and re¬
quired only my assent; and when
Ihad given this, I went my way
breathing more freely but intreas¬
ing y conscicus of the need for
Tond.
Y et, after all, my escape was only
fros physical contact... Try as I
weni ib forget for a whi e the ter¬
liote tvents of this day of wrath,
the iresh memories of them came
citeping back in the midst of those
otner thoughts which I had gene¬
ra ed by a deliberate effort. They
haunted me as I walked swiftly
through the streets, they made
themselves heard above the rumble
of the train, and even as I sat in
a tavern in Devereux Court, de¬
vouring with ravenous appreciation
a weli-grilled chop, accompanied by
a pint of claret, black care stood
behind the old-fashioned, high¬
backed sett e, an unseen companion
of the friendly waiter.
The lighted windows of Thorn¬
dyke’s chambers were to my eyes as
the harbour lights to the eyes of
a storm-beaten mariner. As I
merged from Fig Tree Court and
came in sight of them, I had al¬
ready the feeling that the burden
of mystery and vague suspicion was
lightened; and I strode across
King’s Bench Walk with the hope¬
ful anticipation of one who looks
to shift his fardel on to more cap-
able shoulders.
The door was opened by Thorn-
dyke, himself; and the sheaf of
papers in his hand suggested that
he was expecting me.
“Are those the depositions?” I
asked as we shook hands.
“Yes,” he replied. “I have just
been reading through them and
making an abstract. Holman has
left the duplicate at your cham¬
bers."
“I suppose the medical evidence
represents the ‘complications’ that
you hinted at? You expected some¬
thing of the kind?”
“Yes. An inquest in the face of
a regular death certificate sug¬
gested some pretty definite infor¬
mation; and then your own account
of the ilness told me what to ex¬
pect."
“And yet,” said I, "neither of the
doctors suspected anything while
the man was alive.”
"No; but that is not very remark-
able. I had the advantage over
them of knowing that a death cer¬
tificate had been challenged. It is
always easier to be wise after than
before the event."
“And now that you have read the


depositions, what do you think of
the case? Do you think, for in¬
stance, that the verdict was justi¬
fied?”
“Undoubtedly,” he replied. "What
other verdict was possible on the
evidence that was before the court?
The medical witness swore that de-
ceased died from the effects of
arsenic poisoning. That is an in¬
ference, it is true. The facts are
that the man died and that a pois¬
onous quantity of arsenic was found
in the body. But it is the only
reasonable inference and we cannot
doubt that it is the true one. Then
again as to the question of murder
as against accident or suicide, it is
one of probabilities. But the pro¬
babilities are so overwhe mingly in
favour of murder that no others
are worth considering. No, May¬
field, on the evidence before us, we
have to accept the verdict as ex-
pressing the obvious truth.
"You think it impossible that
there can be any error or fallacy
in the case?
“I
“I don’t say that,” he replied.
am referring exclusively to the evid¬
ence which is set forth in these de-
positions. That is all the evidence
that we possess. Apart from the
depositions we have no knowledge
of the case at al'; at least I have
none, and I don’t suppose you have


any."
“I have not. But I understand
that you think it at least conceiv-
able that there may be, after all,
some fallacy in the evidence of wil¬
ful murder?”
“A fallacy,” he replied, "is al¬
ways conceivable. As you know,
Mayfie'd, complete certainty, in the
most rigorous sense, is hardly ever
attainable in legal practice. But
we must be reasonable. The law
has to be administered; and if cer¬
tainty, in the most extreme, acade¬
mic sense, is unattainable, we must
be guided in our action by the
highest degree of probability that
is within our reach.”
“Yes, I realize that. But still
you admit that a fal'acy is con¬
ceivable. Can you, just for the sake
of illustration, suggest any such
possibility in the evidence that you
have read?"
“Well,” he replied, "as a matter
of purely academic interest, there
is the point that I mentioned just
now. The body of this man con¬
tained a lethal quantity of arsenic.
With that quantity of poison in his
body, the man died. The obvious
inference is that those two facts
were connected as cause and effect.
But it is not absolutely certain that
they were. It is conceivable that
the man may have died from some


natural cause overlooked by the
pathologist—who was already aware
of the presence of arsenic, from
Detling’s information; or again it
is conceivable that the man may
have been murdered in some other
way—even by the administration
of some other, more rapidly acting
poison, which was never found be¬
cause it was never looked for. These
are undeniable possibilities. But I
doubt if any reasonab'e person
would entertain them, seeing that
they are mere conjectures unsup-
ported by any sort of evidence. And
you notice that the second possibil-
ity leaves the verdict of wilful mur¬

“Yes, but it might transfer the
effects of that verdict to the wrong
person."
“True,” he rejoined with a smile.
“It might transfer them from a
poisoner who had committed a mur¬
der to another poisoner who had
only attempted to commit one; and
the irony of the position would be
that the latter would actually be¬
lieve himself to be the murderer.
But as I said, this is mere acade¬
mic ta’k. The coroner’s verdict is
the reality with which we have to
deal."

den hope by his "illustration.
“You admit that fallacies are pos¬
sible and you are able to suggest
two off-hand. You insist, very pro¬
perly, that our opinions at present
must be based exclusively on the
evidence given at the inquest. But,
as I listened to that evidence, I had
the feeling—and I have it still—
that it did not give a credible ex¬
planation of the facts that were
proved. I had—and have—the feel¬
ing that careful and competent in¬
vestigation might bring to light
some entirely new evidence.”
“It is quite possible,” he admit¬
ted rather drily.
“Well, then.” I pursued, "I should
wish some such investigation to be
made. I can recall a number of
cases in which the available evid¬
ence, as in the present case, ap¬
peared to point to a certain definite
conclusion, but in which investi¬
gations undertaken by you brought
out a body of new evidence point¬
ing in a totally different direction.
There was the Hornby case, the
case of Blackmore, deceased, the


Bellingham case and a number of
others in which the result of your
investigations was to upset com-
pletely a well-established case
against some suspected individual."
He nodded, but made no com¬
ment, and I concluded with the
question:
“Well, why should not a similar
result fo low in the present case?”
He reflected for a few moments
and then asked:
“What is it that is in your mind,
Mayfield? What, exactly, do you
propose?”
"I am proposing that you should
allow me to retain you on my own
behalf and that of other interested
parties to go thoroughly into this
case."
"With what object?”
"With the object of bringing to
light the real facts connected with
the death of Harold Monkhouse."
"Are you authorized by any of
the interested parties to make this
proposa.?
“No; and perhaps I had better
leave them out and make the pro¬

QUESTION:—C was accused of
frustrated murder His case was
remanded to the proper court after
preliminary investigation. C before
he was accused of frustrated mur¬
der, was promised by the new muni¬
cipal council an appointment as
chief of police of the municipality
of B. Is C, despite the fact that
he is accused and his case is stil
pending, qualified for the position?
—S. Damian, Ba lesteros, Cagayan.
ANSWER:—C can not assume
the post because, according to
Sec. 2272 of the Administrative
Code, when a chief of police is ac¬
cused criminally, he should be
suspended from office until after
the final decision of the case by
the courts.—Answered by Atty.
Deogracias T. Reyes, Samani lo
Building, Escolta, Manila.
QUESTION:—Being eligible as
chief of police, I was appointed tem¬
porary chief of police for five days
in Nagbakel, Ilocos Sur, on Jan¬
uary 10, 1936. Is it true that my


five days appointment as chief of
po ice of Nagbakel, Ilocos Sur, dis¬
qualifies me from taking service in
case of vacancy ?—Modesto Dalligos,
Pilar, Abra.
ANSWER:—Elig ibilit y
for chief of police examination
automatically expires upon pub¬
lication of the results of the exam¬
ination, given the following year,
and is not extended by the tempo¬
rary appointment for a few days
of the eligible. In view of the
foregoing, if you qualified in the
examination given in 1936, you are
eligible for appointment until the
results of the examination to be
given in 1937 are published, but if
you qualified in the examination
given in 1935, your eligibility for
appointment terminated upon nub¬
lication of the results of the 1936
examination.—Answered by Jose
de los Reyes, major general, pro¬
vost marshal, Philippine Army,

rather inscrutable expression which
I found a little disturbing. At
length he spoke, with unusual de¬
liberation and emphasis.
"Are you sure, Mayfield, that
you want the real facts brought to
light?”
I stared at him, startled and a
good deal taken aback by his ques¬
tion, and especially by the tone in
which it was put.
"‘But, surely,” I stammered, in
reply. "Why not?'
“Don’t be hasty, Mayfield," said


he. “Reflect calmly and impar¬
tia ly before you commit yourself
to any course of action of which
you cannot foresee the consequences.
Perhaps I can help you. Shall we,
without prejudice and without per¬
sonal bias, take a survey of the
status quo and try to see exactly
where we stand?
'By all means,” I replied, a lit¬
tle uncomfortably.
“Well,” he said, “the position is
this. A man has died in a certain
house, to which he has been con¬


Is your face too round or your nose
rather small?
If so, you can correct these cond tions
by applying your rouge well in toward
your nose and downward along your
cheek.
Lo! The face has narrowed and the
nose appears more prominent.
If, on the other hand, your face is
narrow and your nose rather promi¬
nent, keep the rouge away from your
nose. Place it in a horizontal crescent
that starts at the outer corner of your
eyes and recedes upward toward the
temples.
Chances are if your face is round,
your underchin is apt to be full. So
while you’re experimenting with your
rouge, try shadowing a little under
double chin.
Voila! It seems to disappear.

fined as an invalid for some con¬
siderable time. The cause of his
death is stated to be poisoning by
arsenic. That statement is made
by a competent medical witness who
has had the fullest opportunity to
ascertain the facts. He makes the
statement with complete confidence
that it is a true statement, and his
opinion is supported by those of two
other competent professional wit¬
nesses. It is an established fact,
which cannot be contested, that the
body of deceased contained suffi¬
cient arsenic to cause his death. So
far as we can see, there is not the
slightest reason to doubt that the
man died from arsenical poisoning.
“When we come to the question,
"How did the arsenic find its way
inte the man’s body?' there appears
to be only one possible answer.
Suicide and accident are clearly ex¬
cluded. The evidence makes it
practically certain that the poison
was administered to him by some
person or persons with the intent
to compass his death; and the cir¬
cumstances in which the poisoning
occurred make it virtual'y certain
that the arsenic was administered
to this man by some person or per¬
sons customarily and intimately in
contact with him.
“The evidence shows that there
were eight persons who would an-
swer this description; and we have
no knowledge of the existence of
any others. Those persons are:
Barbara Monkhouse, Madeline Nor¬
ris, Anthony Wallingford, the
housemaid, Mabel Withers, the
cook, the kitchen-maid, Dr. Dims-
dale, and Rupert Mayfield. Of these
eight persons the police will assume
that one, or more, administered the
poison; and, so far as we can see,
the police are probably right."
I was rather staggered by his
bluntness. But I had asked for his
opinion and I had got it. After a
brief pause, I said:
“We are still, of course, dealing
with the depositions. On those, as
you say, a presumption of guilt lies
against these eight persons collec¬
tively. That doesn’t carry us very
far in a legal sense. You can’t in¬
dict eight persons as having among
them the guilty party. Do you take
it that the presumption of guilt lies
more heavily on some of these per¬
sons than on others?”
“Undoubtedly,” he replied. "I
enumerated them merely as the
body of persons who fulfilled the
necessary conditions as to oppor¬
tunity and among whom the police
will—reasonably—look for the guilty
person. In a sense, they are all
suspect until the guilt is fixed on
a particular person. They all had,
technically, a motive, since they all
benefited by the death of deceased.
Actually, none of them has been
shown to have any motive at all in
ordinary and reasonable sense. But
for practical purposes, several of
them can almost be put outside the
area of suspicion; the kitchen-maid,
for instance, and Dr. Dimsdale and
yourself."
'And Mrs. Monkhouse,” I inter¬
posed, "seeing that she appears


to have been absent and far away
on each occasion when the poison
seems to have been administered."
Precisely,” he agreed. “In fact,
her absence would seem to exclude
her from the group of possible sus¬
pects. But apart from its bearing
on herself, her absence from home
on these occasions has a rather im-
portant bearing on some of the
others."
“Indeed!" said I, trying rap¬
idly to judge what that bearing
might be.
“Yes, it is this: the fact that the
poisoning occurred—as it appears
—only when Mrs. Monkhouse was
away from home, suggests not only
that the poisoner was fully cogniz¬
ant of her movements, which all the
household would be, but that her
presence at home would have hind-
ered that poisoner from administer¬
ing the poison. Now, the different
persons in the house would be dif-
ferently affected by her presence.
We need not pursue the matter any
further just now, but you must see
that the hindrance to the poisoning


caused by Mrs. Monkhouse’s pre-
sence would be determined by the
nature of the relations between
Mrs. Monkhouse and the poisoner."
“Yes, I see that."
"And you see that this circum-
stance tends to confirm the belief
that the crime was committed by
a member of the household?
“I suppose it does,” I admitted,
grudgingly.
“It does, certainly," said Thorn-
dyke; "and that being so, I ask you
again: do you think it expedient
that you should meddle with this
case? If you do, you wi'l be taking
a heavy responsibility; for I must
remind you that you are not pro¬
posing to employ me as a counsel,
but as investigator who may be¬
come a witness. Now, when I plead
in court, I act like any other coun¬
sel; I plead my client’s case frankly
as an advocate, knowing that the
judge is there to watch over the in¬
terests of justice. But as an in¬
vestigator or witness I am con¬
cerned only with the truth. I never
give ex parte evidence. If I investi¬


gate a crime and discover the crim-
inal, I denounce him, even though
he is my employer; for otherwise I
should become an accessory. Who¬
ever employs me as an investigator
of crime does so at his own risk.
“Bear this in mind, Mayfield,
before you go any further in this
matter. I don’t know what your
relations are to these people, but I
gather that they are your friends;
and I want you to consider very
seriously whether you are prepared
to risk the possible consequences of
employing me. It is actually pos¬
sible that one or more of these per¬
sons may be indicted for the mur¬
der of Harold Honkhouse. That
would, in any case, be extreme'y
painful for you. But if it happened
through the action of the police, you
would be, after all, but a passive
spectator of the catastrophe. Very
different would be the position if
it were your own hand that had let
the axe fall. Are you prepared to
face the risk of such a possibility?”
I must confess that I was daunted

yaHE article of Dean Gabino
Tabunar, ‘Leaky' Educational
1 System, while well-meaning
in its suggestions to the National
Council of Education, neverthe¬
less, has evoked much unfavorable
comment among teachers who have
pronounced the article unfair and
detrimental to the prestige of
public school teachers. For who
could swallow the indictment that,
because the educational system of
the Philippines is too centralized,
teachers "merely follow orders?
False Notion
The belief that the centralization
of education in the Philippines is
anything but perfect and produc
tive of inhibitions against initiative
in research and schoo! improvement
does not tally with facts. The read-
ing public has only to remember
that during the last ten years the
Bureau of Education has con¬
sistently followed programs of re¬
form. Since 1915, the system has
improved so much that Dr. Paul
Monroe, who recently visited the
Philippines, pronounced it “one of
the best in the world."
Outstanding Improvements
The following may be considered
the most outstanding achievements
of the system during the last ten
years: (1) The improvement and
vitalization of instruction; (2) the
dynamic re-construction of the cur¬
ricula; (3) fruitful experimenta¬
tion and research; (4) influence
of measurements in education upon
technical, scientific, sociological,
and pedagogical literature of teach¬
ing; (5) multiplication of month-
ly journals and other school pub¬
lications as a result of experimen¬
tation and research; (6) the ex¬
pansion of the vocational program;
(7) vitalization of the health and
physical education programs; (8)
efficient field supervision; (9)
productive in-service training of
teachers; (10) the improvement
of school plants; (11) efficient
training of teachers; (12) extra¬
curricular activities offered by
community assemblies; (13) mul¬
tiplication of student and profes¬
sional libraries; and last but not
least (14) the reorganization and
redirection of general supervision.
It is impossible to discuss in de¬


tail all the above achievements
within the scope of an article like
this. Suffice it to say that the
reading public would benefit much
by reading all the recent annual re¬
ports of the director of Education
and other Bureau publications. To
them (the reading public and cri¬
tics) wi'l be revealed facts tending
to show that in general, the system
far from being "leaky" and inef¬
fective, has done much to improve
the welfare of the masses in accord-
ance with the limits provided by
law, and in particular, has made the
28,000 public school teachers confi¬
dent in their mission. The facts,
also, will reveal that far from cur¬
tailing teacher initiative, the sys-
tem has enabled the teachers to
take part in that adventure of
building up the system which dur¬
ing a ten-year period has shown
amazing progress. It has been the
case of building up from below,
from the foundation—the field
staff, the teachers, the pupils.
Disgruntled Views
Of all government systems calcu¬
lated to promote public good, the
educational system has suffered
most from unfair, biased attacks.
People who have become disgruntled
because they fai ed to secure favors
from the present educational sys¬
tem have become its bitter enemies.
Such a situation does not happen
often in other branches of the gov¬
ernment. It may be said, however,
that the present educational sys¬
tem of the Philippines needs a tho¬
rough, comprehensive survey, to
reveal further its faults and to add
to its worth. There is even neces¬


sity for rummaging among volumi¬
nous archives to get at the root of
whatever perplexing problems may
exist. The present Bureau of Edu¬
cation has always been a system
which fosters research, experi¬
mentation, study, and investiga¬
tions, in order that it may conform
to the needs of our ever-changing
civilization. It has never been sta¬
tic. Unlike other departments of
the government, it has been the on¬
ly one which has been frank, cou¬
rageous, and wise enough to have
requested an educational survey and
benefited from it.
Problems On Observations
A close scrutiny of the system of
education in the Philippines with
statistics made use of, is necessary
before a fair estimate of the sys¬
tem can be pronounced. Those who
have the welfare of the system at
heart, need to observe closely actual
conditions before voicing their
views. Unless this is done, no real
understanding of the system can be
had. Here in Batangas, evidence
that teachers take part in the im¬
provement of the system is abun¬
dant. A visit to this province will
reveal conditions as they are, con¬


trary to current belief that “teach¬
ers merely follow orders."
The fo'lowing are examples of in¬
ventiveness, progress, and initia¬
tive developed during the adminis¬
tration of Mr. Arthur T. Heiden¬
reich, division superintendent of
schools for Batangas: (1) Library
work in the elementary grades the
results of which were evaluated and
experimented on in the 1936 vaca¬
tion summer school at Baguio;
(2) Auditorium work in the inter-
mediate grades which aims to
broaden the cultura’, artistic, aesthe-
tic spirit of the pupils which aims
to foster the foundation of little
theaters in big provincial capitals;
(3) The annual fo k song and dance
contests which, records show, ori¬
ginated in the division of Batan¬
gas; (4) Annual boy scout jambo¬
rees; (5) Development of landscape
gardening and school ground im¬
provement in barrio and central
schools; (6) A concrete-iron fence
for every elementary school of the
division (even some barrio schools
have concrete fences); (7) Doing
away with the notorious method of
renting buildings for school pur¬
poses; (8) Type A Curriculum
which has been put into successful
operation in the academic-voca¬
tiona' high school; (9) The instal¬
lations in all central schools of sub¬
stantial playground apparatus in
lieu of athletic equipment not suit¬
able to the ages and sizes of ele¬
mentary school children and (10)
The incentive for the development
of intramural games and activities,
etc., etc. These and all others de¬
monstrate the fact that the most
important thing in a school system
is the development of teacher ini¬
tiative. Mr. Arthur T. Heidenreich
has been one superintendent who
believed in the growth of a system
from below.

Caught
By RODOLFO C. PENSERGA


NHE frantically looked around
her, hoping to find any pass¬
O ing vehicle—a tartanila per¬
haps. But there was mone to be
found at this ungodly hour. She
could see only a few persons lei¬
surely strolling along. Then she
began to gather speed, glancing
here and there. She felt that all
the stro lers’ eyes were on her, but
she didn’t mind. Presently, she
lifted her head high and the moon


above caught her eyes. Then she
heard the church bell chime eleven
times. She shuddered.
Suddenly her lips twisted into a
wry smile. No, they wouldn’t
know it, and even if they would...
She hastily cast away the thought.
No, they would never find it out.
But suppose, just suppose, they
would know where she had really
been?
Now she began to hate him as
she rea ized how foolish of her to
have gone alone with him this
night.
Nearing home, she clamped her
teeth to give her courage. The
moon was partly covered by a thin
mass of clouds. Again she tried
to ignore the disagreeable fear of
her parents’ ever knowing the
truth, but the more she tried, the
dizzier her head became. Throwing
back her curly hair, she wiped with
the back of her hand the beads of
perspiration on her brow. But
while her head was warm, her
hands were cold. Her heart
throbbed faster and her legs were
heavy.
Finally, tiptoeing softly up the


long fight of steps of her home,
she managed to smile, chiding her¬
self for being a little fool who was
afraid of something that might not
come after all. Slowly, she opened
the massive door, but a low creak
brought someone to the threshold.
She shivered, stood rigid to meet
his father.
“Sh-h-h-h-sh!” it was their serv-
ant. "Walk quietly. You might
awaken them. They have just
arrived—
“From where?” she stammered, al¬


though glad in the thought that
they, too, had taken a walk, gone
somewhere.
The half-light from the shaded
lamp failed to conceal the puzzled
look in the servant’s face as she
spoke: "Why, I thought I heard you
say you were going to the Judge’s
house to visit his daughter! Your
parents, too, went to visit the Judge
and his daughter."
Suddenly she felt something be¬
ginning to crush within her...


Alias Judas Iscariot

IS real name is Francisco and He accepted it. From then on, that
his friends call him Isko Ca- role has always been given to him.
During Holy Week, he and his

The people of the town are very
fend of these 'discipulos’ but it is
perhaps owing to his peculiar role
that many are somewhat shy of
him even though he is a good-na¬
tured man. Even when he is just

the year, many credulous folk think
that he really has the attributes of
Judas. He does not seem to mind
them, though. He still hopes to
play Saint John some day.

readings, however, we came across
some plausible lines. From the
pen of Napoleon Garcia, for exam¬
ple, comes this stanza about how
love may be born in the heart:
Love leaped to flame:
In one brief, fleeting hour,
The fragrance of a flow'r
Came with your name.
How it may be offered and an¬
swered Herminio M. Beltran tells
in
“This is my love for you,” he
told her
And laid unon her hand a rose¬
hued flower.
"Well, this is mine," said she
and handed back
His crumpled offer.
Why does something in us "leap
to flame" and urge us to declarations
of love and fealty? Jaime S. To¬
maneng of Magsingal, Ilocos Sur,
prefers to state the reason in un¬
answerable queries:
Need there be words
To speak between us,
Must there be telling
Of your loveliness complete
In so many unlovely words?
Must the silence
Between us be broken,
Need there be singing
Of your tenderness infinite
With words, little unnzusical
words?
Or love might have been requited
and then, like everything, it came
to an end. Let Herminio M. Bel¬
tran sing of the attendant pain:
Dark clonds have cast a darkness
o'er
Our earth and sky;
This is my way—that, yours: this
hour
With pain shall die!
There were pictures which have
moved us with their beauty. Re¬
called in tranquillity or rebuilt in
fancy, these turn more beautiful
still and become imbued with new
significance, as Jose P. Perez
proves in
In fancy I behold
Many a glorious realm:
Meadows broad and gardens
green,
Swaying trees and glistening
streams.
My lips are mute, my heart beats
fast,
And every throb within the
breast
Is an ache of gladness and a hope
For things sublime, for nobler
heights.
If you have lived in the country
and seen sunsets on hills and ani¬
mals grazing in the fields, you will
appreciate the impression Inocen¬
cio V. Ferrer wishes to convey
with
Flocks of sunbeams graze on the
hills;
Twilight comes a good shep¬
herdess
Who drives and guides them
home.
A few of our contributors write
of children and youth and in¬
nocence. Some such inspiration
has moved Jose Poblador to indite:
I saw the children and I thought
of life,
And the sly deceit of the years;
O children, grow not, grow not in¬


to men—
All laughter changes but to tears.
And now, here is ours:
By Fancy soon, ah soon, that
Love is shred
Which though intense is merely
Fancy-bred.

Under Class S, the same mathe¬
matical formula is followed, only the
amount is smaller, dues being P2.50.
Here Pedro brings in 18 new mem¬
bers worth P45 before he gets his
P20 benefit aid. But, unable to
bring in 18 new members, he must
wait for his regular aid which “be¬
come due and payable by turns and
in strictly orderly sequence of date
and time of enrollment...
₱54,000 Profits in Few Months
Investigated by Felix Tanchanco,
an examiner of the Insurance Com-
missioner’s office, it was discevered
that the firm was selling certificates
of a speculative nature without
having first obtained a permit from
the Insular Treasurer’s office. The
enterprise showed a gross income of
P54,334, collected from 9,096 Class
C members and 2,692 Class S mem¬
bers. They alleged, however, that
from November 14, 1935, to March
25, 1936, the enterprise paid out
130,967.50 in benefit payments to
691 Class O members and 206 Class
S members.
The investigation also showed the
officers received salaries ranging


from P300 and below, not to mention
bonuses amounting to 10% of the
gross membership collections.
Not A Thrift Device
Organized to help the unemployed,
yet the spirit of personal gain is not
prominent. The by-laws do not of-
fer a device by which the members
can save or become thrifty. Like-
wise, the "special members” are not
members at all, because they are not
entitled to the corporate member¬
ship privileges such as attending
meetings of the corporation, part¬
icipation in business deliberations
or e ections of officers and board
of directors, or of being elected to
any position in the management of
the corporation. They are mere
Luyers of certificates that promise
them profits beyond the ordinary.
Another Firm at Escolta
With the lure of easy money so
strong, another group organized
themselves in a similar enterprise
and now do business at a Manila
downtown office. They offer three
kinds of “benefit aids": Groups A,
B, and C, with fees of P0.50, ₱1.00,
and P2.00, respectively. On the same
scale, benefit aids are P5, ₱10, and
P20, if the first member can bring
in 20 other members.
Upon enrollment and admission of
the 20th member, the first one gets
the benefit, called "Aid No. 1” Now
here is the catch: Then when the
second group of 20 new members
are added to the first group of 20
original members, "Aid No. 2" is


given. Thus No. 2 gets the aid
when 40 members are in, No. 3
when 60 are in, No. 4 when 80 have
become members, and so on. Pay¬
ment is made after 5 or six months
from the time one has brought in
his quota of 20 members.
Does Business Without Permit
Registration of this enterprise as
a corporation was ordered held
in abeyance by the Insurance Com-
missioner "until the city Fiscal has
handed down a ruling. Unregister¬
ed, without a permit or license to
operate and sell securities, yet the
managers have gone on ahead
fieecing people while the fleecing is
good!
As studied by Atty. Jose A. Ja¬
vier, of the Insurance Commis¬
sioner’s office, these enterprises are
violating Act No. 2581, as amended
by Act No. 2817, known as the Blue
Sky Law. It provides:
“Section 1.*x** The term "spe¬
culative securities" as used in this
Act shall be deemed to mean and
include:
(a) All securities to promote
or induce the sale of which pro¬
fits, gain or advantage unusual in
the ordinary course of legitimate
business is in any way advanced
or promised.
“(b) All securities for promo¬
ting the sale of which a commis¬
sion of more than five per cent is
offered or paid.” (Italics ours.)
In the accused corporation, the
profits promised amount to 700%
of the original investment of P5 and
P2.50, as the case may be. Then,
for getting new members, a commis¬
sion of 10% (camouflaged as 5%
commission and 5%traveling allow¬
ance) is also promised. These are
both violations of Sub-Sections (a)
and (b), Section 1 of the Blue Sky
Law.
Other Nefarious Schemers
Another corporation, duly re¬
gistered with the bureau of com¬
merce last October 14, 1935, hides
its illegal scheme behind the thin
blind of a high-priced, few-paged
monthly magazine. To-day, to rake
in more money, it promises a flat
bonus of P100 to every member at
the end of the year. But, not
considering this bonus, why were
complaints made by members to the
city fiscal’s office and the Insurance
Commissioner’s office for failure
of the corporation to give out the
promised prizes ranging from P3
to P2,500 depending on whether the
new members brought in are 5 or
19,500!
More enterprising, another bunch
asked innocents to give P0.50 each,
for which an embossed certificate
will be given in return appointing
them delegates to the World
Eucharistic Congress! A good idea,
only anybody can attend the
Eucharistic Congress in Manila next
year, without getting gypped of his
money.
A Rizal Avenue optometrist, with
offices near the Cine Ideal, hit upon
the plan of collecting ₱1.00 from
each member and promising to

QUESTIONS:—What is the age
of an infant most conducive to
effective vaccination for small pox?
Why is it that the given age is good
for vaccination? How often may
the vaccination be repeated?—A
  reader, Manila.
ANSWERS:—The best age to
have vaccination for small pox
given is beiween four and six
months; young babies are not
apt to have fever nor dread the
process as are o der children, and
it is a good idea to have this over
before dentition begins.
It is best to have this vaccina¬
tion repeated every five to seven
years, oftener if there should be
an epidemic.—From “The Parents”
Magazine.
* * *
QUESTION:—My young chi'd
has been exposed to measles. What
vaccination for prevention is best
for it?—C. J. M., Manila.
ANSWER:—For measles there
is, as yet, no routine vaccination


for prevention, but if a chi'd is
known to have been exposed to
the disease there is a serum taken
from convalescents that may pre¬
vent the exposed child from hav¬
ing the disease if given early
enough, within four days after
exposure. However, this will not
brotect the child for more than
hree to six weeks and it is dif¬
ficult to obtain. There is another
method more generally in use now,
which is taking some whole blood
from a person who has formerly
had measles and injecting this
into the exposed child within four
days after exposure. Usually this
will not entirely prevent an attack
but will make it so light that the
child is seldom really ill and no
serious complications develop. By
having this mild attack of measles,
the child is then protected for
life. The blood injected must be
free from other disease germs;
whenever possib'e the parents”
blood should be used.—From “The
Parents’ Magazine.

Another Toothless Law
Why can such corporations regis¬
ter themselves so easily? Because
the Director of Commerce has only
ministerial powers to approve and
register the articles of incorpora¬
tion of any enterprise. His powers
are not discretionary, unlike in In¬
dia where the director of commerce
can immediately cancel incorporation
papers as soon as he discovers that
illegal methods are being used by
the corporation in its transactions.
We cannot blame the director of
commerce; on the contrary, we
should blame our Corporation Law
for not giving the director a mighty
club which he can wield against
erring corporations.

AS A THIEF...

by Thorndyke’s blunt statement of
the position. There was no doubt
as to the view that he took of the
case. He made no secret of it. And
he clearly gauged my own state of
mind correct'y. He saw that it was
not the crime that was concerning
me; that I was not seeking justice
against the murderer but that I
was looking to secure the safety of
my friends.
I turned the question over rap-
idly in my mind. The contingency
that Thorndyke had suggested was
horrible. I could not face such a
risk. Rather, by far, would I have
had the murderer remain unpun¬
ished than be, myself, the agent of
vengeance on any of these suspects.
Hideous as the crime was, I could
not bring myself to accept the of¬
fice of executioner if one of my
own friends was to be the victim..
I had almost decided to abandon
the project and leave the result to
Fate or the police. But then came
a sudden revulsion. From the
grounds of suspicion my thoughts
few to the persons suspected; to
gentle, sympathetic Madeline, so
mindful of the dead man’s comfort,
so solicitous about his needs, so
eager to render him the little ser¬
vices that mean so much to a sick
man. Could I conceive of her as
hiding under this appearance of
tender sympathy the purposes of a
cruel and callous murderess? The
thing was absurd. My heart re¬
jected it utterly Nor could I en¬
tertain for a moment such a thought
of the kindly, attentive housemaid;
and even Wal ingford, much as I
disliked him, was obviously outside
the area of possible suspicion. An
intolerable coxcomb he certainly
was; but a murderer—never!
"I will take the risk, Thorndyke,”
said I.
He looked at me with slightly
raised eyebrows, and I continued:
“I know these people pretty in¬
timately and I find it impossible to


entertain the idea that any of them
could have committed this callous,
deliberate crime. At the moment,
I realize circumstances seem to in¬
volve them in suspicion; but I am
certain that there is some fallacy
that there are some facts which
did not transpire at the inquest but
which might be brought to the sur¬
face if you took the case in hand."
“Why not let the police disinter
those facts?
"Because the police evident'y sus¬
pect the members of the household

President Hinoguin
As an organization, the Chicago
Cebuanos have Macario A. Hinoguin
as their president. He combines wis¬
dom and tact in leading his province¬
mates so that there is harmony and
teamwork in every activity under¬
taken by the organization. He
holds the Ll.B and Ll. M. degrees
and expects to be a member of the
Philippine bar when he returns to
the Islands.
President Hinoguin is an en¬
thusiastic exponent of the “Settle
in Mindanao" movement among
Filipinos in Chicago. This cam¬
paign became so pervading that it
resulted in the formation of the
Mindanao Fraternity in Chicago.
It enrolls as members those who
have lived in Mindanao and those
who expect to live there in the
future.
Reason for Sports
People back home might ask,
why the sudden interest of Chi¬
cago Filipinos in sports? Well,
simply for the reason that speeches
have lost their salt as an effective
means of publicizing the Philip¬
pines. Almost any Filipino turns
orator when he reaches America.
Americans, we have noticed,
have become tired of orations by
Filipinos. So new ways have to
be thought of to remind them
of the Philippines. And athletic
achievements were the result.


WHO WRONGED THIS..
Continued from page 9
gation.
  Makes Inquiries
 , asked to inquire into
the case, decided to pick up the cud¬
gel if there was any cudgeling to
be done. Malacanang was seen
about this, then the bureau of edu¬
cation, and finally the Department
of Public Instruction. In Under¬
Secretary Alejandro Albert’s office
records were brought out revealing
Teacher Beltran has been exone¬
rated.
Documents show that the Beltran
investigation took place from March
19 to March 22, 1935. Venancio
Baliad and his daughter were pre¬
sent, so was the accused teacher,
and the witnesses were called in
one by one. Pupils also gave testi¬
monies. It was admitted Brigida
was called to the carpentry shop
but eye-witnesses said no untoward
acts were committed. What was


worse, it was discovered during the
investigation that Brigida main¬
tained amorous “relations with one
Francisco Barot, an outsider.
Results Made Known
Baliad was officia’ly notified by
Superintendent Babcock last April
15, 1935, that the investigation
“failed to substantiate the charge
that Mr. Melecio Beltran was the
father of the unborn child of your
daughter. In fact, the evidence
submitted strongly indicate that
one Francisco Barot was the father
of the child."
The aggrieved father was not
satisfied. He wrote Frank Murphy,
then governor-general, last July
25, 1935. As revealed by other do¬
cuments, Gabriel Mana’ac, acting
director of education, last August
19, 1935, reported to Vice Governor
J. Ralston Hayden, then secretary
of Public Instruction, that the bu¬
reau did not believe Teacher Bel¬
tran guilty of immorality.
Dr. Albert Makes Report
Under-Secretary Albert also stu¬
died the papers and on August 24,
1935, wrote to Vice Governor Hay¬
den: “After a careful examination
of the report of the investigation,
I concur in the opinion of the Di¬
rector of Education that the evid-
ence in this case is not sufficient
to hold the respondent guilty of im¬
moral conduct.”
Thereafter the case rested, and
Teacher Beltran continued to hold
his position at the Hinunangan
elementary school. Baliad did not
feel satisfied, and had to write the
President twice about it. With the
later letters referred back to the
department of public instruction,
Under-Secretary Albert sent a me¬
morandum to Malacanang last Jan¬
uary 31st of this year, once more
reiterating his former opinion.

He stood forlorn with the on¬

Continued from page a
school curricula, Assemblyman Vi¬
llanueva created a sub-committee
of three. The aim of the change
would be to fit the curricula to our
economic and social conditions un¬
der the new government.
“It is not a question of reducing
the number of years in the element-
ary schools,” the assemblyman said.
“The point is: how to alter or sup-
plement the subjects actua’ly being
taught so that we can produce more
useful citizens for the country.
Some people agitate for the reduc¬
tion of years used up in the pri¬
mary and intermediate grades from
7 to 5 years. The number of years
may be reduced to even 4 years or
increased to 10 years, but the goal
should be to produce finished pro¬
ducts as soon as pupils go out of
the intermediate schools.”
From the first year in the mid-
dle school, the assemblyman noted,
Japanese boys are separated from
the girls. “The separation of the


sexes in the high school is not a
part of the changes the committee
will recommend,” he said, "but
merely what I consider an ideal
thing. I am voicing merely the
sentiments of mothers and fathers."

and they will certainly pursue the
obvious probabilities."
“So should I, for that matter,"
said he; "and in any case, we can’t
prevent the police from bringing a
charge if they are satisfied that
they can support it. And your own
experience will tell you that they
will certain’y not take a case into
the Central Criminal Court unless
they have enough evidence to make
a conviction a virtual certainty.
But I remind you, Mayfield, that
they have got it all to do. There
is grave suspicion in respect of a
number of persons, but there is
not, at present, a particle of posi¬
tive evidence against any one per¬
son. It looks to me as if it might


turn out to be a very elusive case."

menading with her brother and
some companions. Mando asked
him to join them, but in his con¬
fusion said he’d rather not.
One afternoon, he was talking
with Mando sitting in the chair be¬
side him. They talked of many
things. She came and sat on her
brother’s chair’s arm and listened
to their talk. Nardo who had been
talking so glibly before was now
stammering and feeling uneasy, al¬
though it was Mando he was talk¬
ing with.
After a while she asked Mando
to get her something from their
room, and when Mando left, she
continued sitting there on the arm
of her brother’s chair. Nardo
looked at the tall mast of the ship
in front of them or at the sea to
his left. He never glanced at her
on his right. The silence between
them was alive and in it he could


hear his heart beating and tossing
like the blue sea beyond the ship’s
rails. He wondered what she was
thinking of. It pained him to just
sit there and not be able to say any¬
thing. If it had been Mando sit¬
ting there, he could tell him of
many things: he could say, I like
horror stories, do you like horror
stories? Have you seen Franken¬
stein? Or: What course would you
take up after graduation from high
school?... But to her he could
say nothing, and he wished Mando
would hurry back. When Mando
came back, he handed her some¬
thing, and she stood up and joined
the other girls. But she did not
talk much, and she looked at the
distant horizon often.
When they reached the end of the
trip, everybody was too busy with
landing to even say, “Good-bye,
hope to see you some day. Manila
is quite a big town, but I hope to
see you some day.” In the days that
followed he saw her only three
times. Manila was too big a town
and he kept himself close to his
books.
The next time he saw her was back
in the little town in the province.
They had come earlier about the
middle of the school year and con¬
tinued their studies at the local
high school. He met her at the ten¬
nis court. She was learning his
favorite sport. After her game she
passed by him where he stood at
the narrow gate. She looked up at
him, but his eyes were frightened
and shy. He said, I’m still a sap.
F IKE him, they were not natives
Eof that southern town. In fact
they came from the same province
he came from in the Visayas. That
year, they left for their home prov-
ince. He did not see her leave. But
one morning he woke up to find
them gone and felt funny, as if a
void had been placed there in his
heart in the night...
That happened four years ago.
On’y last year Nardo saw her pic¬
ture in some of the papers, one of
the strong candidates for the na¬
tional beauty queen. He looked at
the picture long, and clipped it and
pasted it in his album. She had
not changed: she was still as beau¬
tiful as when he last saw her in
person. Later, he read she did not
win in the beauty contest. And
yet he felt a girl like her wouldn’t
care for things like that really. She
would not shed a tear. She would
be the same girl he knew.
ND now they tell him of her
Ain a tone they will use talking
to any one else: Remember Roge¬
lla, you know the girl who once
studied here and was elected the
most popular girl in town... And
he wants to tell them, Remember
her, remember Rogella? Are you
asking me.. ! But he cannot say
this, he can’t say anything. They
will not understand, they will not
even understand if he tells them
he’s a big fool, the biggest ever.
And when they te’l him of her
marrying within the month—he
has really nothing to say.

There will be
no school crisis
this year. Pres.
Quezon assured
t h at when h e
made assembly¬
men promise that
their first meas¬
ure will be pro¬
viding for school
funds. *an
Frank Murphy,
enroute to Wa¬
shington, took time at Shanghai to
explain to press people that Filipi¬
nos are rapidly qualifying them¬
selves for se'f-government. “They
are realists and willing to face
facts.” *xn
Still in the planning stage, the
survey board has now lit on the
idea of classifying and standardiz-
ing positions and readjusting ser¬
vices. The trouble is every bureau
and office now wants to have big¬
ger personnel and fatter salaries."ax
Seeing Clippers land or take-off
will not be possible in the future,
because the airport and mooring
base of the Pan-American Airways
Cippers will be located near the
Cavite Navy Yard. A tract of land
at the head of Canacao Bay is be¬
ing purchased, where the firm will
establish offices, shops, and ware¬


houses. axx
South Manila is taking half
baths, because water pressure there
is only at half norma! to permit the
damaged pipe, now fully repaired,
to be permanently anchored in ce¬
ment. *ag
Manila almost sizzled to-day as
Old Sol put on the heat waves to
see just how the city would stand
100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, highest
since 1915. The sale of ice, ice-drop,
ice-cream, and cool drinks was
fast. *xx
Joint campaign of Manila police
and the city fiscal’s office against
vice, always said, never done, is pro¬
mised by Chief Torres and Fiscal
Diaz to start in July. *sa
Revenue - man
Alfredo Y atco
now knows how it
feels to be sued
by an ex-associate
justice of the sup¬
reme court, be¬
cause Leonard S.
Goddard to-day
wants the court
to compel Mr.
Yatco to return
A. Yatco
₱618.55 to him,
representing income tax he paid
under protest this year. *xx
Armed Moro brigands, 16 of
them, are terrorizing Christian set-


tlers along Iligan Bay, Lanao, into
giving them money and food. *ax
What’s in a name? Yet Customs
Collector Aldanese changed the
name of his accounting division to
the more peppy Liquidation Divi¬
sion, beginning to-day. *xx
Haile Selassie
will go about
without his giant
umbrella carrier.
An Italian firing
squad executed
him along with
other natives on a
murder and pil¬
lage charge. *
H. Selassie
It’s leap year,
you know, hence
Conchita Tenorio, of Barrio Bolbok,
Taal, Batangas, felt herself justi¬
fied in stabbing lover Salustiano
Banawe when he dilly-dallied about
marrying her. And Uncle Calixto
and Nephew Andres Alcantara, of
Barrio Buhi, also of Taal, killed
each other because Nephew Andres
tried to get frisky with Tia Josefa
Mendoza, Calixto’s wife, *ax
Patrolman Lupo Arras is now
grinning his teeth and showing his
chest out. Dr. Pedro Ve'asco of
the city complained to Judge A.
Locsin that Arras abused his au¬
thority, but the cop whispered to


the judge that the doctor called him
“bicho" and presto! the good doctor
found himself slapped with a P3-
fine. *an
It’s a beautiful case of the worm
turning when Luneta Policemen
Jose Tantay and Mendoza were
mobbed by 200 persons in Intra¬
muros. The cops tried to arrest
gangster Elpidio Andaya and, be¬
ing in plainclothes, Intramuros re¬
sidents mistook their identities and
stoned them. They’re resting at
the Phil. General hospital.
Tuesday, May 19
The 1937 bud¬
get is proving a
hard nut to crack
for Budgeteer Ma¬
rabut. He’ll not
be able to present
it to Pres. Quezon
on May 20th as
scheduled. “Maybe
on May 30th,” he
A
promised."a
Old Sol turned
S. Marabut
kinder to city re¬
sidents by reducing the temperature
to 98.6 to-day from yesterday’s
100.4 Fahrenheit.***
The P. I. may become poorer
by P47,000,000 because the U. S.
Senate passed the Adams bill re-
pealing the law which granted P. I.

that amount as dollar devaluation
profits. Pres. Quezon said the in-
justice was the result of the war
secretary’s refusal to convert P. I.
treasury funds in U. S. to gold
bullion.*ax
Police Chief
Torres’ force re¬
ceived a black-eye
from Pres. de la
Fuente of the city
council when he
said that the cops
couldn’t locate the
Chinese driver that
hit and ki led Bea¬
A
trice Samson de
M. de la Fuente Arigue of 613
Trabajo last Nov.
1, 1935. A lawyer, Mr. Fuente ad¬
ded, is now wire-pulling to have the
case settled amicably.*ax
Three problems worry Pres.
Quezon a great deal: reorganization
of the national government, an
economical budget, and measures
insuring collection of taxes. They’ll
be looked after first, said assembly¬
men."a*
Charitable institutions and some
assemblymen don’t want the sweep-
stakes abolished after the June
draw, and they will fight hard for
its retention.x
Oil scandals got hot when Nica¬
sio Osmena and Jacob Rosenthal
were among those prosecuted as
promoters and incorporators of the
South Cebu Oil Co., Inc., and the
O. R. O. Oil company.*a*
Proud, indeed, was the Phil.
Aerial Taxi as it completed its mil¬
lionth mile to-day. During the five
and a ha’f years of its life, it made
a record of 8,6
flying hours, car¬
rying 16800
ssengers between
X
Manila and Ba
Jose Fabell
lth commis¬
sioner, suggested an expensive thing
when he mentioned that pay wards
at the Phil.
ral hospital are
better abolished to give way to free
wards. He al
ans to turn the
San Lazaro ho

hospital with
nmodations for
1,000 patients.
Tarlac went the other prov-
inces one better by cancelling reduc¬
tions in salaries of provincial of¬
ficials and employees because of
the soundness of its finances."*
It’s probable we’ll have another
holiday because Pres. Quezon de¬
signated Interiorman Quirino chair¬
man of a committee to study the
best way of celebrating the Con


J. G. VILLA'S APPEARED

Our attention has been called to
the fact that the first short story
of a Filipino to appear in Story is
not Manuel E. Arguilla’s "How My
Brother Leon Brought Home a
Wife," as was stated in a recent
issue of  , but Jose Gar¬

We have always said Meralco
should put its wires under the
ground, expense or no expense.
But Meralco is still deaf, so 8-year¬
old Hermogenes Balagtas, 205 So¬
lis, got himself electrocuted when
a length of wire laden with bunt-
ings for the Gagalangin fiesta
snapped, entangled with a Meral¬
co wire on the way down, and coil¬
ed around little Balagtas. He was
killed instantly. xas

Too much profit making caused
Customs Collector Aldanese to sus¬
pend duty-free importations of the
Rice-Corn Corporation. For the
first 50,000 sacks imported, the
corporation realized P122,000 net
profits. But with Aldanese’s deci¬
sion, the corporation will pay
P375,750 in duties for 125,00 sacks
imported. *as

Vicente Singson Encarnacion,
of the National Rice-Corn Corpo¬
ration, said profits from sale of im¬
ported rice will all go to govern¬
ment coffers. He mentioned also
that it would be bad to sell Saigon
rice at P4, cost price, as it will de¬
stabilize prices for local rice.*xx

Early exploitation of Davao
lands will prevent Japanese expan¬
sion there, suggested Assemblyman
Romualdo Quimpo. For quicker
solution he wants Japanese land
cases taken to court; surveying and
subdividing public lands and issuing
titles for them to Filipino applic¬
ants; and no other solution being
taken, let Japanese contracts expire
but forbid their renewals."an
Manila’s zone plan, i. e., divi¬
sion of the city into residential,
commercial, and industrial districts,
is being studied by Interiorman
Quirino for application in provin¬
cial towns. The plan, he said,
would be beneficial to business,
aside from proving convenient for
the people.*xx

COMMENTS


UCH praised was the speech of Assem¬


M bly Floor Leader Jose Romero before


WITH RESPECT
TO LABOR
Rotarians, Thursday, last week. He gave a
clear-cut outline of the tasks confronting the national lawmaking body
and gave assurance of fair dealing with business and capital. But more
interesting is the pledge, not a new thing, to tackle labor unrest in ear¬
nest.


Perhaps this proposal to do something to remedy the labor prob-
lem is seriously meant this time. No one should be more aware than
Floor Leader Romero of the fact that in the past, when protestations of
interest in the welfare of the laboring class were as loud, if not louder,
as now, practical solution to the difficulties of the workingman was
about nil. There have been nice-sounding legislations passed, it is true,
but where are the results? Indeed, Floor Leader Romero would not
have to include in his list of tasks confronting the Assembly the so¬
lution of the labor problem if all the good intentions displayed in the
past in behalf of labor had borne fruit.
Very aptly the floor leader said: “The government should be
able to remedy a situation where laborers and their families are re¬
quired to subsist on less than half a peso a day...” And the floor leader
understands very well the danger involved if the government continues
to make half-baked efforts to attend to the workers of the nation. “It
is,” he said, “the better part of wisdom to diagnose the labor problem
in its incipient stage and apply the remedy accordingly.” Indeed, it is
the better part of wisdom!
THE ONLY POINT —HE collector of customs has raised a
A very interesting question in wanting to
impose duty on rice imported by the Rice and Corn Corporation. Should
the corporation pay duty or not?
We do not pretend to know anything about the legal aspects of
the controversy. But it does seem to us that there is only one point
of importance in the issue. And this is that which involves public wel-
fare. Would it be to the better advantage of the people who consume
rice to admit duty free rice imported by the Rice and Corn Corporation?
Or is it the other way around, requiring the corporation to pay duty as
the collector of customs desires?
These questions can be answered definitely. And they should
be answered definitely. These answered, should there be any doubt
as to whether rice imported by the corporation should pay duty or not?


Just Curi
JE are itching all
Wcuriosity. We
dering if there is an
news that the pres
has already been purchased
that the yacht is neither
Southern Cross nor the Ca
but the No. 2 yacht in the
York Yacht Club. No. 1 is Vi¬
Astor’s Nourmahal.
Also we are wondering
every government big shot w
he has a chance gets hoarse sh
ing in defense of the pinch-fa
unwashed workingman when th
big shots don’t even have the gu
to enforce laws already pas
for the protection of the unshoc
and the underfed. Remember
masterpiece of a legislative lem
the tenancy law?
Also why of late the polic
department and the city
office are cat-and-dogging
Also why assemblymen cannot
make up their mind about comfort
and beauty in the session hall and
stop tearing up that portion of the
legislative hall each season.
Also why the department of
labor, if it is true the cause of
labor is close to the heart of the
like
government, is being trea
an unwanted child in a fami
rags, so to speak, and subsisting on
left-overs.


Y-ROM statements issuing from the Manila city hall, it is
WHY?
Every clear that the cocheros have the city councilors
scared. Even Municipal Board President Manuel de la Fuente shows
a trace of this when he showed willingness to compromise and not re-
quire cedulas in the registration of cocheros. Does Mr. Manuel de la
Fuente realize that he has to present his new cedula before he can get
his automobile driver’s license renewed each year? Why the exception in
the case of cocheros?
There is not a single reasonable excuse for not passing the pro¬
posed ordinance compelling cocheros to register and requiring them at
the same time to present their cedulas before the certificate of regis¬
tration should be issued. This is not only protection for the users of
culesas who have been robbed and slugged often enough by cocheros
hard to trace and arrest afterwards, but protection for the calesa own-
ers and the good, law-abiding cocheros as well.
INEQUALITIES GECRETARY of Finance Antonio de las Alas is
O authority for the statement that there are
inequalities in the salaries of many government officials holding posi¬
tions with identical responsibilities. This is only too true and the ear¬
lier these inequalities are corrected the better it would be for efficiency
in the government service.


The President has been quoted
as saying before school teachers
assembled in Baguio that the Phil¬
ippine Constitution regards the
welfare of the state as paramount
in contrast with the American
Constitution which places indiv
dual welfare above that of the
state.
Fine.
But just what exactly is meant
by the welfare of the state?


It is not the teeth in the Blue
Sky Law that will discourage the
development of this country’s natural
resources but those who bilk the
public under the guise of exploitation
of the wealth of the country. After
the current expose in connection with
oil companies, even stocks of enter¬
prises absolutely on the level will be
under suspicion.

Gives Economy Without Equall


Its sig eylinders use less gas and
oil—in fact, use the least gas
and oil—because six cylinders
are the most economical combi¬
nation used in modern automo¬
blles.


The 1936 Chevrolet is more economical
to run. Every test proves it. Every
owner knows it. There are very de¬
finite reasons why Chevrolet’s cost of
operation is low. Before you invest in
your next car --- investigate Chevrolet
economy, quality, riding comfort.
Find out about this great value leader
which enjoys such commanding pop¬
ularity among motorists everywhere.


Its vulve-in-head design cuts gaso¬
line consumption still lower be¬
cause there is less loss of heat
through the walls of the com¬
bustion chamber in valve-in-head
engines, and the advanced con¬
struction of the Chevrolet engine
gives maximum heat (or power)
saving.


Most important of all, Chevro¬
let’s more efficient cooling sys¬
tem, pressure stream oiling and
the greater accessibility of all
working parts result in more
dependable operation, over a
longer period of time, with the
lowest maintenance costs. Thus,
Chevrolet’s valve-in-head engine
—only one of its kind in Chevrolet's
price range—gives economy with-
out equal.
