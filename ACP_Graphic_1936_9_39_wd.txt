F you have been wondering whether

or not to marry a college graduate,
— the best thing is to ask a husband
who is married to one. And because she
may be graduating this month and as yet
you have not decided, we thought of mak¬
ing the task easier for you. We did the
asking for you. For your answer, turn
to page 4.
On page 6 is an article by Mrs. Flo¬
ra A. Ylagan which we find so interest
ing we cannot help recommending it very
strongly. Many Filipino women have
traveled abroad but no one has brought
home more, judging from the article,
fruitful experiences than Mrs. Flora A.
Ylagan who when abroad, took advantage
of every opportunity to be known as a
Filipina by wearing her native costume
Incidentally, another woman, who
was in Manila last week, won our admi¬
ration by being proud of her nationality.
Anna May Wong, familiar to movie-go¬
ers, who was a Manila visitor last week,
gave that impression. "Not high hat
very cultured,”
our Home and Fashion
editor said. What Miss Wong said about
Hollywood you will find on page 8

Now folks, it may seem a bit to
early to mention the Christmas issue fo
1936, but there you are, you have rea
yourself what a good issue it will be.
rT is not very often we read about dis
coveries in the local medical world
and less often about the men whe make
these discoveries. One of the two electec
by the U. P. as distinguished alumni for
1935 is Dr. Candido Africa, co-discoverer
of an intestinal fluke which journeys to
the heart causing cardiac failure and to
the brain causing cerebral hemorrhage.
In our next issue, you will read the
story of this modest doctor’s life
And talking of doctors, you will be
extremely surprised to read some of the
opinions of a number of medical men re¬
garding, of all things, miraculous cures,
mental telepathy, and other things ordi
narily labeled superstitions. Many of us
who are not even near-scientists pride in
our so-called enlightenment and say
"pooh-pooh" to anything we cannot log

INDUSTRIAL ARTS in the
ELERURABES
WHAT THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION IS DOING
TO CONTRIBUTE TO VOCATIONAL EFFICIENCY
IN THE GRADES
By DR. GILBERT S. PEREZ
Superintendent of Vocational Education
The President, recognizing the need for a "recast-
ing of our educational system;' created the National
Council of Education. In view of this,   is
especially interested in publishing articles which will
show not only the good points of the present system of
education but also its weak points. These articles will
be of incalculable value to those who will compose the
National Council of Education. On this page is an
article, Industrial Arts in the Elementary Grades, by
Dr. Gilbert S. Perez, chief of the division of vocational
education of the Bureau of Education. On the next
page is an article which purports to voice the disap-
pointment of parents at the results of instruction in the
elementary grades.
the elementary curriculum does not
offer subjects which contribute to
vocational efficiency. Educators
prefer to consider the years of the
clementary grades as formative
periods where special attention
should be given to general educa¬
tion, and although practical sub¬
jects have been included in these
grades they are offered more as a
part of the equipment which every
boy should have, irrespective of
the vocation which they shall pur¬
sue in later life.
The educational bible, both gen¬
eral and vocational, is made of four
gospels:
one which relates to the
acquisition of language, another
which is concerned with the social

sciences, one which is concerned

as it had been done ten years ago.
With money available, the work
of ten years ago was continued.
Now the Iriga monument to the na¬

heroine, is faithfully sculptured at
the foot of the monument, while the
great Filipino patriot occupies the
pedestal at the top.

will continue studying until gradu¬
ation from the university. The
courses calculated to make of the
student an independent, reliable,
resourceful citizen are strung all
the way from the primary grades
up to the last year of college. Since
the majority of the school popu¬
lation leaves school after the com¬
pletion of the elementary grades,
more so now because to go on and
study for a career is practically
useless for lack of opportunities
for remunerative employment after
graduation, the majority of pupils
leaves school with a smattering of
many things and is good at
nothing.

these parents are in the majority,
they will not hesitate to say they

that when these children finally

of Manila, Tomas Earnshaw was
asked to recommend his candidate
for the position of Manila chief of
police. He recommended Col. Tor¬
res but because the appointee had
to be an American, Capt. Piatt was
appointed instead.
In 1929, he ran for a seat in the
Manila municipal board and was
elected. He was elected councilor
of Manila for three consecutive
terms and was president of the
board during his second term.
Among the many things for which
he is remembered are:
The cancellation of the Haygood
contract, which resulted in a yearly
savings of P50,000 to the city of
Manila from 1933 to 1942.
H
The
Haygood contract, found anomalous,
was investigated through the efforts
of Torres. Also, the Metropolitan
Water District investigation espe¬
cially with respect to the construc-
tion of the balara filters. The Phil-
ippine Senate, through the efforts
of Torres, caused the investigation
of the project. Manila partly owes
the existence of the present sanitary
tap water to the crusading former
member of the Manila municipal
bcard. The installation of three
traffic buoys which save the city
the salaries of six traffic cops every
year is also to his credit.
Col. Torres, however, is remem¬
bered best as the first to organize
cadet battalions in Manila high
schools. In 1906, 1907, and 1908,
he organized cadet corps in the Li¬
ceo de Manila and Ateneo de Ma¬
nila.
He is particularly proud of

A Tura scanned
the foot of the
trail again. There
was a pucker in
his brow as he moved his eyes slowly
over the landscape. There was not a
moving thing in sight. The trail be¬
gan abruptly where it topped a
low cogon-covered hillock on which
stood a lean straggling wild cher¬
ry. It wound past his store and
disappeared again twenty yards at
the foot of an old tamarind tree.
Looking down from the top of the
trail opposite his store, he could
see the neatly paddied fields below
and beyond them a thin blue
line that was the river
Ka Maria placed the last salmon
can on the shelf and looked inquir¬
ingly at Ba Tura. A pair of spec¬
tacles was perched well down her
nose over which she peered by
stretching her neck like a turkey
"What are you staring at, Tu¬

Ba Tura turned abruptly. "Noth-

But there was no doubt he had
something in his mind. He helped

remarked Ka
Maria. “He seems to be heading

“The what?” exclaimed Ba Tura.
“The... what is coming over

‘You are sure he is coming this
way, Maria?
“Yes, why?” She looked at him
sharply.

Ba Tura seemed to grow more

more communicative.

tion. He stepped out of the store
and strained his eyes toward the
foot of the trail. The sun was
fast disappearing behind the top
of the tamarind tree. The long
slanting rays fell in broad orange
patches in the fields below and the
river beyond was blue. Far away
among the clumps in the valley, a
small white figure was toiling up
the trail. He would disappear be¬
hind the hedge of kallos and ka¬
muning now and then and again
would emerge into view much
nearer than before.
"He will be here any minute
now," remarked Ba Tura to him¬
self aloud. “This is his usual time
anyway.
"Who, Tura?”
“The surveyor. He is coming up
the trail.
"Do you think Pacio knows?”
persisted Ka Maria.
"Why shouldn’t he know?”
“Jesus! What do you say, Tu¬
ra?
“I asked why Tura shouldn’t
know.
“That is it. Then Tura knows.”
"Why shouldn’t he after seeing
them?”
"What—what were they doing,

Ka Maria appeared to be horri¬

“But Pacio—how did he know?”
“How can he help it when he saw
them? Saw them holding hands?
“Sus! the slut!
Ba Tura did not hear her. He
was intently watching the ap¬
proach of a man in a brown hel¬
met, white shirt, khaki breeches,
and boots. There was nothing
hurried about his movements. In
fact, Ba Tura thought they were
too irritatingly
slow, indifferent,
supremely careless. He did not
even bother to brush aside an over¬
hanging twig which lashed at his
face. The man merely rubbed a
smarting cheek and went on.

Ka Maria was fairly shouting

Giant Micro-Mirror Aids
Beauty
A new beauty aid that shows up
skin blemishes has been introduced
recently in London. The instru¬
ment, known as the Dermascope, is
a mirror device that greatly en¬
larges the image reflected so as to
show even the slightest flaw in the
complexion.
The magnifying mirror is mount¬
ed in a chrome shell similar to the
kind used for automobile head¬
lights. A lamp housing inside the
shell throws a light through the
mirror’s edge. Through the use of
Dermascope, cosmetics may be ap
plied in a more natural way

Objectionable, Yes!
There is complete democracy in
a Mera’co bus; but, certainly, some¬
thing ought to be done about dirty
ill-smelling passengers in stinking
undershirts and, just as vile, shorts.
Twice, it happened. There were
several girls of us, going home in
a Meralco bus. The man, as des¬
cribed, got in with unwrapped raw
meat and a milk-can containing
cow’s blood. The odor, exud ng
from the man, caused dismay and
disgust to men and women rid ng
in the bus. What was worse, the
bus swerved—Santa Cruz-G. Tua¬
son buses always swerve—and, ca¬
lamity! cow’s blood was spilt on a
feminine dress.
The point is, why can’t the
agents of the law enforce the city
ordinance prohibiting men from go
ing around in undershirts and
shorts? And why can’t Meralco
conductors refuse them a ride, es¬
pecially when the bus has only very
little standing room left?

Our foreign fiction reprints have shown Dorothy Parker in various
moods. The following verses do the same: the first is thoroughly cynical;
the second, though still no milk-and-honey tid-bit, nevertheless betrays a
certain sentimentality—note the third line especially; and the third is frank¬
ly with a heart, so to speak, particular attention being due the poignant
and beautiful seventh and eighth lines.

Police, Gangsters In Leaque
It will be humanly impossible for
President Quezon to make the Com
monwealth a clean, safe, law-abid¬
ing country, if his subordinates,
agents of the law, are the ones who
lead in promoting vice, bribery,
scandal, and gangdom activities.
A Laguna jueteng is said to be
run by the wife of a prominent
government official; a justice of
the peace commits estafa, a judge
is dismissed for indiscretions. But
here in Cebu things are in a worse
condition. For some of Cebu’s po¬
licemen are in league with the un¬

After you have decided how much

of the mat to show around the
picture, you cut it into the desired
size, of course. Then you go to a
furniture shop and buy a piece of
glass in the same size as the mat.
Then you cut a piece from the
thick cardboard, also in the same
size as the mat. Punch two holes
through this cardboard, which will be
used for the back of the picture, one
hole two inches from the left side
and six inches from the top and the
other hole two inches from the
right side and six inches from the
top. Cut two pieces of wire (hair¬
pins will do) about four inches
long each, bend each piece at the
center, then form a ring about one
inch in diameter at the bent end by
twisting the wire once or twice. In¬

Miss Wong arrived in Manila in¬
cognito and registered at the Ma
nila Hotel under the name of Miss
Lim Wong Tsong, the nearest ap-
proach to Anna May Wong, she
said. This was her first trip to the
Orient. She has black, straighi
hair, which she wears parted in
the middle and drawn into a knot
at the nape of her neck. Some¬
times she combs out the bangs. She
uses lipstick but no rouge. She
looks like a Filipina at first
glance, but is taller than the aver
age. She has a low, well-modulated
voice and very nice manners.

Having undergone the same train¬

they should have common interests

Dr. Alfredo Baens, senior resi¬

Baens, of the professorial staff of
the University of Santo Tomas

college graduate again without
hesitation—if he were to do it all
over again. “I married a woman
ohysician whose specialty is simi¬
lar to mine. We have therefore
similar interests and we have ma¬
ny things in common. Marriage is
for us a very happy one and not a
mere experiment. Besides, I have
found my wife more than a mere
housekeeper—as most wives are¬
being a professional like myself."
Another physician of the govern¬

Marriage," according to Assem¬

a physician, "is in most cases

business proposition.
My wife is
a university graduate and I found
her a good business partner, as
well as an intelligent housekeeper.
A Manila newspaper man, who is
married to a social worker, shares
the same view.

COMMENTS
THE GOVERNORS YT is not hard to believe that the League of
L Provincial Governors in recommending the
appointment of Board Member Maximino Noble to the post of governor
of Camarines Sur was actuated by no other motive than to play the gallant
and be nice to a colleague, for Maximino Noble has been acting governor
in the absence of Gov. Ocampo who has been ill. The League, to be sure,
erred in making such a recommendation, but it seems out of place to
impute meddling to the act. It would certainly be very stupid of the
League if it hoped to dictate to the President.
Now that the President has placed the provincial governors where
they belong by telling them that the "league would certainly be a help-
ful organization if instead of approving resolutions of this nature it de-
voted itself to the study of ways and means whereby provincial gover-
nors could help one another and the national government in the promo¬
tion of the public weal,” the provincial executives should act with more
propriety in the future. The provincial governors had it coming to them
in a manner of speaking. They were reported working for a cabinet
seat to represent them. And on top of this, this recommendation in be¬
half of Maximino Noble.
The provincial governors should have been more alert. The times
have changed in Philippine politics and nowhere is this more in evi¬
dence than in Malacanang. Against the old sway of politics, indifference
to messes in the government, and toleration of even brazenly crooked
officials the President has declared a relentless war and from what acts
he has done in this direction so far, it is evident he meant it. The gov-
ernors shoud have been cognizant of this and avoided such acts as may
invite a slap in the face.
* * *
WHAT, AGAIN? Yy rE are completely in accord with the latest
W drive against immorality initiated by the
Mayor. But similar activities were displayed in the past, and the com¬
merce in immorality went on just the same.
Perhaps it would have been better, before initiating this new cam¬
paign against immorality, to inquire into the why of the failure of the
previous campaigns. Were the members of the police force indifferent
to the campaign? Were they friendly to those running lodging houses
and if so, why? This done, the high officials at the City Hall will know
how to conduct that kind of immorality drive which will produce results.

ALBAY'S CASE
A tween the provincial government of Albay
and the national government. Albay authorities are hanging on to their
decision to reduce the cedula tax to one peso and the national govern¬
ment is attempting to break down Albay’s resistance by suspending all
public works in the province.
There must be very little intelligence in provincial government cir¬
cles in Albay if they thought they could win in this controversy. In all
probability they knew the cedula tax reduction to one peso could not
succeed but election promises must be acted upon, the impossibility of
realizing them notwithstanding. Should the Albay officials lose out in
this controversy as they must, the officials can simply tell the electorate:
“We did our best, but what can we do against the will of the national
government?
But the Albay officials cannot escape responsibility for these: para¬
lyzation of public works in the province and the resultant loss of wages
of people employed in these public works; and worse, the humoring of
the masses’ erroneous and dangerous belief that they are entitled to all
the benefits the government may dole out without having to pay anything
for such benefits.
