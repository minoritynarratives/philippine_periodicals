y OU may have to express your opi¬
Ynion, one of these days, on the
question of whether or not provin¬
cial governors and municipal presidents
should be primarily chief executives or
primarily politicians. You had better
start thinking on the subject and as a
sort of stimulant, we recommend the
symposia on pages 4 and 5.
rnHE first thing you may say upon
1reading the article on page 6 is
this: In spite of the fact that we have
made more progress during American
sovereignty than during Spanish, we are
really more Latin than Anglo-Saxon,
judging from the way we manufacture
generals. Colonels to brigadiers general
to majors general all in the space of a
few weeks! But we would advise you
not to be so funny. There may be some
very sound reasons back of all this—and
remember, Major General Douglas Mac¬
Arthur, tested soldier, has okayed the
whole thing.
yE believe in letting the people
know, as we are doing on page
8, about things that would affect
them somehow sooner or later. There
is a move afoot to create more cities in
this country (there are only two now:
Manila and Baguio), and the plan to in¬
troduce the city-manager system of gov¬
ernment for Manila, to replace the pre¬
sent mayor and council set-up, ought to
be of interest to big towns like Cebu, llo¬
ilo, Cabanatuan, and others aspiring to
be cities some day. Will they prefer the
mayor-and-council style or the city-ma¬
nager kind? Mr Justice Laurel, Profes¬
sor Gamboa (U. P.), Manila Municipal
Board President Manuel de la Fuente and
Manila Councilman Fugoso have ideas
worth-while knowing with reference to
the subject.
- Y OW let us go into something more
Nimmediately useful: There is an
idea that may mean cash to you on page
9, another one on page 12. The former
is about some poison you can grow in
your backyard, the latter about cotton in
Mindanao.
Barrio Barrymores, Gables, and Joan
Crawfords would like to hug P C. Mo¬
rantte for his stuff on page 10. But
the enthusiasm should not go to the ex¬
tent of packing up your belongings into
your bags and tampipis and hot-footing it
to Hollywood.
Xr HEN President Quezon announced
Wa week ago that he would close
Culion, he did not know how happy Cu¬
lion inmates would be if this leper colo¬
ny were finally padlocked. On page 16,
an ex-leper bas a more radical idea con¬
cerning the handling of lepers.
E almost forgot: we wanted to
Wsay that compared to your town,
Manila is a pretty clean place. But
you need not die of shame because
your municipio's town plaza is full of
hogs, goats, and even carabaos and the
things they generally leave behind. For
Manila has an army whose sole duty is to
scrub the capital behind the ears. Turn

THE SPOTLIGHT


Just what kind of life the Italians
live under Mussolini is only one of the
many interesting items in this week’s
Potpourri.
yE have two short-short stories in
Wthis issue. Brick Walls and Once
Upon a Time. These stories are first
stories.
Brick Walls, according to Mrs. Pa¬
terna Matta Gonzales, is a first attempt.
Concerning Once Upon a Time, Miss
"I am submitting the
Valderrama said:
accompanying story for publication, but
I am also enclosing a self-addressed
stamped envelope just in case—. You
see, A. E. L. returned my first attempt
at short-story writing years ago. I am
glad A. E. L. did that. So this must be
her first story too.
But we assure you we
are not by any means
being big-hearted by
publishing these first
short stories.
Alejandro J. Celis,
who painted the origin-
al of this week’s cover,
is Manila born, and an
Ateneo graduate (A.B.).
He attended the School
A. J. Celis of Fine Arts, U.P., and
dedicates himself largely
to portraits and landscapes. 515 Raon,
Sta. Cruz, Manila, is his residence.


coming issues
R. A. B. Rotor, commenting on
DA. E. L.’s review of three plays
presented in Baguio, said in Themes
and Portraits, May 1st issue of the The
National Review: ... people who are
sick should stay in bed and not write
dramatic reviews.
Now we shall give you a chance to
judge whether people who are sick should
stay in bed and not write articles. This,
from A. E. L.: "Am enclosing first part
of my symposium (WHAT OUR WRIT-
ERS READ—Part I: The Ladies).
You may have it set, and if you wish you
may announce it for the issue of the 14th.
Ill send you the second part later.
y r E are satisfied with the paintings
Wwe have been reproducing in our
covers. There is room for improve¬
ment, of course, and we wish to an¬
nounce that we suspect Jose Garcia Villa
may bring about the necessary improve¬
ment. We received this from J. G. V.:
"I am painting, painting, painting.
The paintings on your covers are bad."
YN HIS should arouse the fighting spirit
I of the true Malay in P C. Mo¬
rantte in Hollywood: “P C. M., your
Hollywood operative, is a clever, auda¬
cious, and prolific writer indeed. He has,
it is well-known, fared well with such
cinema personalities as Mae West, Mau¬
reen O'Sullivan, George Raft, Harold
Lloyd, Jack Oakie—famous people all—
and he should be highly commended
for his efforts so far. But I will bet he
would not be able to 'shoot the works"
with such distinguished ones as Clark
Gable, Warner Baxter, Franchot Tone
-dreadful he-men all!'
What do you say, P. C.?

The Law Of Might


cer ET us have faith that right makes might,” Lincoln
L said once.
If it were only true that "right makes might”! The con¬
sciousness that one is in the right may make him fight harder in
defending his side, but fighting one’s best may not even be enough
to slow down the enemy. The Ethiopians, fierce fighters and
rendered more willing fighters with the realization that they are
defending their own homes and country against invaders, have to
bow to the superior strength of the Italian army.
The moral verdict of the world, you only have to re¬
member the stand taken by the League of Nations on the
Italo-Ethiopian question, is that Ethiopia is in the right.
And that Italy has no excuse for coveting the country of
a weak and defenseless people like the Ethiopians. But
at this writing, Emperor Haile Selassie is said to be al¬
ready in flight from Addis Ababa with the members of
his family. Which proves that in the world of realities,
he is right who has might. At no time in the known his¬


tory of the world has opinion indicting aggression been
stronger than in the case of the Italian invasion of
Ethiopia. But Italy has the strength to defy world opi¬
nion and prove that against the strong justice for the
weak does not exist.
In justice to Mussolini who is Italy, he is only following in
the footsteps of conquerors all historians love to honor. For
ages conquerors have caused their countries to fatten from the
lands and wealth of weaker peoples. The human race to date
has really made no substantial progress from the law of the jungle.
What can weak nations be thinking of now, after Mussolini’s
Ethiopian adventure? What else but the future, which is dark?
The Philippines has elected to take her chances in a
world which believes in and practises the law of survival
of the fittest. The Philippines would be a sorry country
if it elected to run its own destiny in the mistaken belief
that, as Lincoln once said, "right makes might."

y ITH the Italians on the
outskirts of Addis Ababa
W
last Saturday night (Sun¬
day in Manila), there was much
confusion, shooting, and plunder¬
ing in the city. Bandits looted
homes and set them on fire. The
Ethiopian government had evacua¬
ted the city the day before, Em¬
peror Selassie’s family having
fled to Djibouti, en route to Jeru¬
salem. It was reported Selassie
was with his family, although
many were sure he wou'd stay in
the capital. He had returned to
the capital only a day or two be¬
fore.
While the flames spread, the for-
eigners in the capital sought refuge
at the legation. It was feared the
Ethiopian warriors might mob the
foreigners, and the latter hoped the
Italian forces would enter the city
soon.
Italians On City Outskirts
It was reported that 40,000 Ital¬
ians had been ready to enter Addis
Ababa ever since last Friday night
but had postponed their entrance
pending secret negotiations with
the Ethiopian government. French
reports had it that Selassie, imme¬
diately prior to his departure,
urged his cabinet to continue the
resistance but the cabinet demanded


Benito Mussolini: his troaps are fast
nearing Addis Ababa, Ethiopian capital.


surrender.
The Negus told newspaper men
before he left that he will marshal
his forces in the vicinity of Harrar.
It is said he will found a new cap-
ital in Wallega province.
Addis Ababa Is Warned
The other Sunday, Italian air¬
planes whirred over Addis Ababa,
dropping leaflets which warned the
populace thus: “It is our mission to
occupy Addis Ababa and Ethiopia
for civilization. If Addis Ababa is
delivered to us without resistance,


we will not bomb it. Otherwise we
will destroy the city.”
Meanwhile the Italian forces con¬
verging toward Addis Ababa from
the northern and southern fronts
forged with renewed energy in or¬
der to race with the coming rains.
Thousands of Ethiopians were re-
ported killed on the southern front,
in the way of General Rodolfo Gra¬
ziani’s soldiers pressing towards
Jijiga and Harrar.
On the northern front, Italian


Emperor Haile Selassie: abandons
Addis Ababa.


soldiers moved unimpeded toward
Addis Ababa. A huge column of
15.000 Fascist soldiers riding in
1,000 armored cars lugging along
heavy mountain artillery left Des¬
sye along the Imperial Highway
the following day, bound for Addis
Ababa. Their main problems were
crossing streams and fixing por¬
tions of the highway destroyed by
the Ethiopians.
Heavy Italian Losses
The Italians, however, met plen¬
ty of resistance on the southern
front. For the first time in many
months, the Italian press failed to
report Italian victories in the fight
around Sassa Baneh. It was ad¬
mitted that the losses on the Ita¬
lian side reached 2,000 men, only a
little less than the casualties on the
Ethiopian side.


Emperor Haile Selassie with
members of his family and va¬
rious members of his cabinet ar¬
rived in Djibouti, French Soma¬
liland, on May 3rd and imme¬
diately boarded a British des¬
troyer for Arabia. The Ethio¬
pi n royal family is en route to
England. The emperor has aged
tremendously the last few
months and his hair, coal black
only a few months back, is now
completely gray.

y HEN the National Assem¬
bly starts its sessions in
July, on e revolutionary
plan, if introduced as a bill by its
sponsor, will surely arouse nation¬
wide interest. The plan is so ra¬
dical in aim that legislative lead¬
ers believe a referendum—con¬
sulting the opinion of the voters
—may even be held before the
measure is taken up.
As outlined by Assemblyman
Ruperto Kapunan, who first con¬
ceived the idea, the plan would
make provincial governors and
municipal presidents appointive, al¬
though the members of the provin-
cial boards and town councils would
continue to be elective. The ap-
pointing power would reside with
the President of the Commonwealth,
thus insuring prompt enforcement
of statutory laws and executive or¬
ders without undue delay or oppo¬
sition from local government exe¬
cutives.
Efficiency Is Aim
Great improvements in local ad¬
ministration, it is said, would be
realized, should the plan be car¬
ried out. And as Assemblyman Ka¬

Assemblyman RUPERTO KAPUNAN


punan explains:
“We are simply aiming to mod¬
ernize the administration of our
local governments along efficiency
lines. Our provinces are so bed¬
ridden with politics that construc-
tive work practically stops at a cer¬
tain limit.
“Executive work in the prov-
inces," continued the solon, "would
be carried out to complete details
if a man, who is non-partisan, is
appointed as provincial governor."
The plan would also eliminate
conflicts between governors and leg¬
islators in recommending measures
for National Assembly action. Con¬
flicts occur at present because the
provincial governor also plays the
role of legislator, exerting efforts
to please his constituents, when he
should be putting closer attention
to provincial administration.
Balanced Representation
Democratic representation would
also be attained, added Assembly-
man Kapunan, because there would
be executive, legislative, and judi¬
cial officials in the provinces. Just
now, the executive branch of the
government is not represented be¬
cause governors and presidents are
elected by the people, and they per¬
form their offices as politicians
most of the time.
Greater centralization of govern¬
mental entities would be secured,
tending to increase efficiency.
Plenty of red tape would be re¬
moved, and an executive order
would be swiftly coursed to the
appointive governor for immediate
compliance.
Assemblyman Pedro Magsalin is
also in favor of the proposed plan
of making governors and town pres¬
idents appointive.
Checks and Balances
“There would be a system of
checks and balances in the provin-
cial governments," said Assembly-
man Magsalin. “The provincial


Assemblyman PEDRO MAGSALIN


administration would be just like
the city administration. The gov-
ernor would be likened to the city
mayor, and the provincial board to
the city council.
“What we have at present,” he
explained, "is a merger of executive
and legislative work in the elective
provincial governor. Why? Because
the governor is the presiding of-
ficer of the provincial board and,
naturally, whatever he says gen¬
erally goes. No constructive legis¬
lative work can be done because the
governor is always there to impose
his will.
“The same thing happens in
town government. The president
and the council quarrel because
they cannot agree on the ordinances
passed. Appeal is taken to the
provincial board and later, perhaps,
to the Department of the Interior.


Would provincial governments be better
provncial execatives
administered."
wera appointed? The above phato shows
provinsial governors in convention.


Assemblyman CLAUDIO SANDOVAL


But if the town president is also
appointive, he would simply be en¬
forcing the ordinances and execut-
ing everything necessary to make
the town progressive, efficient.”
Bigger Provincial Board
Assemblyman Magsalin believes
that a strong provincial board,
with a greater composition than it
is now, is necessary to put the plan
through. There would then be
miniature governments, each work¬
ing out its problems to a successful
end, while at the same time form¬
ing homogeneous parts of the Na¬
tional Government.
He also pointed out that at pre¬
sent the elective governor is gov¬
erned by partiality in administer¬
ing the different towns of his prov-
ince. He is lenient and liberal to
towns and districts that are affi¬
liated to his party, while he is strict
and selfish to other places whose
political leanings do not conform
with his. Prejudice, naturally,
would result; and the opposing
towns would not get much provin-
cial help for their improvement. On
the other hand, big appropriations
would be given to favored towns.
Politics Eliminated
Assemblyman Claudio Sandoval,
in favoring the plan, gives the fol¬
lowing reasons:
“An appointive provincial gov¬
ernor will have all the time to work
for the good of the province, with-
out worrying himself about his can¬
didacy at the next elections. He is
responsible to the President, there¬
fore he will not fear going against
political moguls who might not like
his administration.
“There would be less interfer¬
ence, because his work will be
purely executive in nature. Again,
such centralization will be for the
benefit of the province due to the
fact that partiality and favoritism
are eliminated as deterrent factors.

That would be turning back to
where we came from! Besides, are
not some of our provinces with

offices elective? I want them to
answer me that.

passion, favoritism, and partiality
would be eliminated by the plan,”
added Mr. Oppus. “That is just

ARELY had Assemblyman
Ruperto Kapunan whisper¬
D ed out his proposed plan to
make provincial governors and
town presidents appointive, than
other solons took notice and pro¬
ceeded to give the Kapunan brain¬
child a bitter tirade. They claim
that the plan is not a political
panacea at all, not even a mild
purge to get rid of what its
sponsor believes to be inefficient,
partial, and careless administra¬
tion in our present system of local
government.
Assemblyman Tomas Oppus of
Leyte, always a ready and willing
fighter, scoffed at the plan. For
him it is just a new-fangled idea,
sure to catch popular attention, but
not at all beneficial to the people
intended to be affected.
Present System All Right
“I want to ask its sponsor,” ex¬
ploded Assemblyman Oppus, "if our
system of local government is a fail¬
ure. Has there been anything
wrong with it? Are not our prov-
incial and municipal governments
running smoothly?
“I need no long-winded refuta¬
tion to carry my point. I simply
want all to notice the progress made
in our provinces, the efficient way
things are administered, and the
autonomy enjoyed by the people un¬
der the present form of adminis¬
tration.
"Why should some people want to
make provincial governors and
municipal presidents appointive?

PAULINO SANTOS MADE CHIEF OF STAFF—SCOUT OFFICERS DRAFTED


YHEN it was learned that
WCol. Paulino Santos, di¬
rector of prisons, was not
among those appointed by Pres¬
ident Quezon to the Philippine
Army general staff corps during
the middle of last January, no
small amount of surprise was
created. The colonel had been
mentioned as a very probable ap¬
pointee to one of the ranking posts.
Just as unexpected was the ap-
pointment of Col. Jose de los Re¬
yes, a retired P. C. officer who
was then chief of the customs se¬
cret service, to the post of acting
chief of staff of the Philippine Ar¬
my, with the rank of brigadier
general.
The explanation given for Col.
Santos’ omission in the appoint-
ments was the great amount of
work that would be on his hands
when the transfer of Bilibid to its
new site in Muntinglupa, Rizal,
would start.

ident recently made, Col. Paulino
Santos was named permanent chief
of staff, with the rank of major
general. Likewise, Brig. Gen. Jose
de los Reyes was designated pro¬
vost marshal general, with the rank
of major general; Brig. Gen. Basilio
Valdes, deputy chief of staff, with
the rank of major general; Col.
Guillermo Francisco, commanding
general of the regular division, with
the rank of brigadier general.
In the presence of government
dignitaries these four ranking army
officials were sworn into their new
posts at 12:40 last Monday after¬
noon by President Quezon at Mala¬
canang.
The appointments of these of¬
ficers and those of others had been
recommended by Gen. Douglas Mac¬
Arthur, military adviser to the Pre-
sident, and had been approved by
the cabinet last Sunday.
The chief of staff is next to
the Commonwealth President in po¬
wer over the Philippine Army. He
will preside over the central gene¬
ral staff which will include among
others the deputy chief of staff
and the provost marshal general.
Col. Vicente Lim, of the U. S.
Army, will be appointed assistant
chief of staff, division of war
plans, with the rank of brigadier
general. Major Rafael Garcia, also
of the U.S. Army, will be made as¬
sistant chief of staff, personnel and


supply, with the rank of colonel;
Captain Fidel Segundo, command¬
ant of the U.P. cadet corps, will be
raised to the rank of colonel and
made assistant chief of staff, intel¬
ligence operations, and training;
Captains Mateo M. Capinpin and
Salvador F. Reyes will be made re¬
gimental commanders, with the rank
of colonel.
Brilliant Record
Col. Santos has probably receiv¬
ed more commendations from his
superiors than any other man in
the P.I. Army.
Born of poor Ilocano parents liv¬
ing in Tarlac, Col. Santos start-
ed from the very bottom. In 1909,
he was 18 then, he enlisted with
the constabulary. He steadi y
rose in rank, until he became cap¬
tain in 1918. In 1923 he became
major, in 1924 adjutant, and then
in 1930 assistant district command¬
er for southern Luzon. He retired
from the constabulary with the
rank of lieutenant colonel and has
devoted his time to the study of
Philippine penology and prison ad-
ministration.
Dean of them All
The post of provost marshal will
be given to Gen. Jose de los Reyes,
it is said, because of his long con¬
nection with the organization and
his knowledge of the peace and or¬
der conditions of Luzon, the Visa¬


Top: Brigadier General de los Reyes
named provost marshal general. Bet¬
tom: Col. Vicente Lim, who mill head
tha tear blana einen


yas, and especially Mindanao.
For 29 years Gen. de os Reyes
has worked with the military orga¬
nization of the Islands. He was
with the constabulary from its in-
fancy, having enlisted in 1901.
Eight years later he became cap-
tain, remaining so until 1917, when
he was promoted to the rank of ma¬
jor. After holding the post for 14
months he was further promoted to
the rank of lieutenant colone and
made assistant chief. He became
full colonel in 1910, all the while re-
taining his position as assistant
chief. Due to fai ing health he
was retired from the service and
he was appointed chief of the cus¬
toms secret service.
Highly Trained
Lt. Col. Vicente Lim is considered
the only Filipino capable of head-
ing the war plans office because of
his high technical training. He is
a graduate of West Point and two
of the highest army colleges in
America, one of which is the War
College. He also took the infantry
school advanced course.
He was enrolled in the West Point
Military Academy in 1910, was
commissioned second lieutenant in
the Philippine Scouts after grad-
uation. In 1922 he was made cap¬
tain in the army, major in 1923,
lieutenant colonel last year.

BFAPURBOUYET PE
THATS HOW MANILA GOVERNMENT IS RATED
BY EXPERTS-CITY-MANAGER PLAN PROPOSED


LOSE students of political
law and government have
O often said that Manila is
fifty years behind in the adminis¬
tration of its government. Other
cities abroad have already changed
their systems of city management
three times—from the mayor-and¬
council form and then to the
city-manager plan—all for the
better. But Manila still clings to
the antiquated mayor-and-council
system.
As pointed out, present tenden¬
cies in the administration of local
governments here and elsewhere are
bringing out the business aspects
of government. The problems in
the administration of a big busi¬
ness corporation are in some res¬
pects similar to the problems of a
city government. And the sound
principles in the city charter can-
not be accomplished unless such
principles are supported by an ar¬
my of capable and upright men and
by an efficient internal organiza¬
tion.
Reforms in the administration of
Manila are being studied by the
Government Survey Board along
lines that will simplify government
machinery by putting honest, ca¬
pable, and efficient men in office.
The city manager form of adminis¬
tration, found successful in the Uni¬


Justice Jose P. Lowrel: says propesed
city-monager slan will maha administra¬
tion more efficient.


ted States, seems to be the logical
solution to Manila’s inefficient ad¬
ministration of its affairs.
Seen as to how the city manager’s
p’an works out, Associate Justice
Jose P. Laurel, also professor of
political law and government, de¬
clared that the new plan will give
rise to non-partisan elections, the
fixing of responsibility through
centralization, at the same time in¬
creasing the efficiency of city of-
ficials. Political partisanship, he
said, will be eliminated to a great
extent.

called commission-manager plan,"

explained Mr. Justice Laurel, “is
successfully used in Dayton, Ohio;
in Springfield, Massachusetts; in
Jackson, Michigan; in Sherman, Te-
xas; in River Forest, Illinois; and
in other American cities. The resi¬
dents there elect a non-partisan
board of directors called a commis¬
sion or council. This counch re¬
ceives nominal salaries or no sala¬
ries at all, and members are per¬
mitted to continue their private ca¬
reers. Their main functions are to
hire, supervise, and control. They
have the power to remove a city
manager, who holds office at their
pleasure, and also to pass ordin¬
ances."
According to him, the city mana¬
ger, a civil service eligible, may or
may not be a local resident. He
holds office in the capacity of an
expert in matters of municipal ad¬


The city manager attends all
meetings of the commission in an
advisory capacity, with the right to
take part in the discussions, but
without right to vote on any matter.
He recommends to the commission
any measure that he may think ex¬
pedient, and is instructed to keep it
fully informed of the financial needs
and conditions of the city. He has
no power to appropriate or to raise
money for any purpose, the preroga¬
tive being left to the council.
Further explanations by Mr. Jus¬
tice Laurel revealed that the city
manager sees to it that laws and
ordinances enacted by the council
are enforced, so that he is in law
and fact the chief executive of the
city. He is also given the power to
appoint and remove heads of city de¬
partments and all subordinate em¬
ployees or officials, although such

in large cities he must be a man of
broad executive experience. His sa¬

to the city manager. He keeps

another, adjusts and plans their
chief work, settles differences that
may arise among them, and acts
as their general supervisor.
His powers, according to Mr.
JJustice Laurel, are: (1) advisory;
(2) enforcing ordinances; (3) ap¬

PrHIS is bad news to bedbugs,

rock-bottom prices of agricultural
products. But the Derris plant is
an exception.
Commands High Prices Abroad
At the time of writing, the price
of the powdered dried roots of
Derris ranged from P1.30 to P2.10

which is around P0.13 a

that Derris roots are,
loosely speaking, almost
"worth their weight in
gold."


Recently a commercial firm in
New York wrote to Director Jose
S. Camus, of the plant industry
bureau, asking for help in making
connections with as many producers
of Derris as possible in the Islands.
This company, which for the last
five years has been interested in
this product, desires to "represent
here as many producers as possible
and to eventually put them into
some voluntary association to keep¬
some orderly control on the market¬
ing; as well as instruct and advise
them, as new methods of market-
ing and planting, etc., are devised.”


The great prospect of this pro¬
duct can be gleaned from these fig¬
ures: The United States alone
spends P5,325,000,000 annually for
inorganic insecticides which can be
re"laced by Derris. In 1931, when
e United States started being in¬
eated in Derris roots, that coun¬
try imported only 4,508 pounds.
This was multiplied over 8 times
the next year. In 1933, the U.S.
imported 575,785 pounds; in 1934,
125,799 pounds. During the last¬

less important roles in the picture
cal'ed The Lost Horison — an
adaptation from James Hilton’s no¬
vel, with scenes or setting laid in
mysterious Tibet.
Among the few who were bidden
to "step up this way” was Valerio
V. Duran, a Filipino born in Po¬
langui, Albay, in 1896. His father,
retired government official and
philanthropist, “established schools
and other civic improvements in
our home town with money taken
from his own pocket" so said the
actor. His mother is still living and
is doing fine, thank you.
The physical features of Mr. Du¬
ran are such that he can pass for
a member of any race. He is five
feet ten and a half inches tall and
weighs 175 pounds. It is doubtful
if a pseudo-scientist just plunging
into his first ethnological research
can tell even after second sight
what Valerio V. Duran’s nationality
is.
“You see,” enthusiastically ex¬
plained my countryman, with a
great deal of amusement, “I even
fooled real Turks at the Paramount
lot when they were casting extras
for the picture The Last Outpost
featuring Cary Grant and Gertrude
Michael. As I said I fooled them.
While the director and his Turkish
aide were going over the line of ex¬
tras, they suddenly stopped in front
of me and the director told me to
brace up and I did brace up as
used to do when I was in the Navy,
and then the Turkish aide said to
me, 'Attention!" and of course
straightened up like an officer and
he and the director were so im-
pressed they asked me who I was
and where I came from."
“What did you tell them?” quer¬
ied this interviewer, anxious to
know how he put the thing over.
“Well, I told them I was a Ma¬
lay. We Filipinos are Malays,
aren’t we? Well, I said, 'T'm a Ma¬
lay.' That’s what I said.” He paus¬
ed and laughed, revealing a per¬
fect set of teeth. His voice is deep
and forceful. His accent American¬
ized. His oval face undergoing a
batch of pantomimic expressions as
he gestured in full abandon about

the room, showing me exactly the
actual picture of how he had been
selected to play an important part
in The Last Outpost out of the five
hundred extras, a great number be¬
ing real Turks, who desired the
role.
“"A Malay?'” Mr. Duran drama¬
tically mimicked the Turk techni¬
cal director’s action, passing his
right hand in a pensive manner
across his shaggily bearded chin,
yes, bearded for the purpose of his
forthcoming role as a mean Chinese
or Tibetan aviator in the current
vehicle The Lost Horizon.
“The poor Turk wondered what
a Malay was," continued Mr. Du¬
ran. “'A Malay? he repeated seve¬
ral times while I said 'Yes’ every
time he said the word Malay. Fi¬
nally the poor Turk said, 'Oh, a Ma¬
lay! You come from the East In¬
dies like Java, Sumatra, Borneo?' I
then rejoined him, 'Yes, yes, that’s
right. I’m a Malay, coming from
those places.' Then the director

later they fitted me with a uniform

“At how much a week?
“Oh, two hundred fifty bucks.”
(That means, in your Philippine
English, five hundred pesos, disre¬
garding the rate of foreign ex¬
change.)
“How much are you getting now
in your coming picture at Colum¬
bia?
“Oh, just two hundred dollars a
week,” said Mr. Duran.
JUST! Funny word that. Two
hundred dollars a week is a lot of
money these days. Should he care
to, Mr. Duran can afford to go to
Hollywood with that even if only
for a few days. But of course, such
a weekly wage is not steady, and he
doesn’t know yet how many weeks
he will be required to work. The
uncertainty of extra jobs he fully
realizes; besides he is a family man,
married to a charming lady from


Colon, Panama, named Leoncia Sala¬
zar, and his earnings go into the
support of his five kids, the oldest
being fourteen, a boy now in high
school.
With a family as large as that,
it is to be expected that Mr. Duran
should have a sideline income, leav¬
ing the precarious extra movie act-
ing jobs to more propitious mo¬
ments. His sideline, rather his side¬
lines are managing boxers of any
nationality and acting as agent for
Central Casting Office. When the
Central Casting Office needs Fili¬
pinos or Malays, it calls upon Mr.
Duran and the latter gets his men
from the pool halls, the cafe shops
at First street, and the barber shops
at Main or from Chinatown. Of
course, there is another man called
up by Central Casting to furnish
the Oriental extras and he is Tom
Gubbins, an Anglo-German with
residence in Chinatown and dubbed
its unofficial mayor.

Valerio Duran has some back¬
ground before he turned movie
actor. He has traveled around the
world—which is an asset. Right in
his home town, when he was a kid,
he found it extremely
interesting
to indulge in “beladas" and other
forms of native plays. In Manila
where he attended the Manila (now
Araullo) High School (among his
classmates he mentioned Juan Nap¬
kil the architect and Benito Legar
da) Mr. Duran was frequently ask¬
ed to take part in school plays. His
histrionic gift was already visible
then, though still in its inchoate
stage. In Shakespeare’s Merchant
of Venice, he played the Duke ex¬
ceedingly well, he said, that he
made up his mind to be an actor.
This ambition of his remained la¬
tent for quite a number of years;
circumstances offered him no op-
portunity to realize his fondest aim
until much later when he was ho¬
norably discharged from the Navy
in 1919. He stayed in San Diego,
doing odd jobs. Then he moved to


Los Angeles where he became a
painter-contractor.
“Then one day,” he said, his eyes
reminiscent, “I was returning from
a painting job and happened to pass
the Plaza and there were a lot of
people gathered. I stopped to watch
it and then as the men were made
to line up I happened to be in the
line and well I didn’t move. Then
a man came up to me and asked me
“Can you ride a horse?' And I re¬
plied, 'Sure, I can ride a horse.' But
to tell you the truth I didn’t know
how to ride a horse then. The man
asked me again, 'Can you ride a
horse on bare back, without a sad-
dle on?' And I said boldly, 'Sure,
I can ride a horse without a sad-
dle on.’ Of course I was only bluff-
ing, just to see what would happen.
Well, the man then said, 'All right,
report at the studio. You are hired."
Boy, I was hired as extra and got
inside the studio and I did not have
to ride a horse at all. That sure
was a lucky break.”
"Did extra jobs in the movies
come easily after that?”

PARNBAA RAUROAML AGO


A catton plantation in Barrio Nanca, Mamungan. Lanao. Cotton which was introduced only a year and a half ago in
Mindanao is now well on the way to becoming a major product.


YERE in our country, we shall
have a Dixie Land, too, if
AA things do not go wrong. We
shall be singing soon, "Away down
south in the land of the cotton," as
do the southerners of the United
States. For cotton has been in¬
troduced in Mindanao and, as far
as it has gone, has been a great
success. We shall be cottoning to
cotton then. We shall be wearing
cotton cloth made in Philippine
factories from cotton grown in
our own country.
At first, we would not believe it


for cotton, we have learned, grows
only in warm climate. And when
we looked up our reference book
what did we find?
“Each plant,”
it says, "is a dainty little bush,
about four feet tall, very clean and
bright, and very particular that the
ground under its feet be soft and
warm and have no common weeds
in it." And Mindanao to you and
and us is a land of mighty forests,
high mountains, cool plateaus.
But it has been done. This year’s
crop of the entire part of northern
Mindanao should amount to between
250,000 and 300,000 lbs. valued ap¬

proximately at P50,000. And to all
appearances, next year’s crop will be
much better.
Go to Cagayan, Misamis Oriental,
where it was first introduced. There
is now a Cagayan Cotton Co. there.
Others are the Paradies and Co.,
and Gotiaco Hermanos. The Bu¬
reau of Plant Industry buys cotton
too. At present Madrigal and Co.
buys all the cotton sold by these
companies for its cotton mill in Ma¬
nila. Recently a Japanese concern
made inquiries about the Mindanao
cotton production with a view to
supplying Japanese cotton factories
no doubt.
The introduction of the plant in
Mindanao is an interesting story.
You must have known by now that
Mindanao is infested with locusts.
Luzon has been ravaged now and
then but locusts seem to prefer Min¬
danao. The problem then was and
is to obtain plants less palatable to

locusts for Mindanao. Experiments
made by District No. 14 of the Bu¬
reau of Plant Industry resulted in
the discovery of many parts of Min¬
danao that have distinctly warm
climates at certain periods of the
year. Just the right climate for
cotton.
Cagayan farmers have been the
first to experiment. They planted
cotton in October, 1934. Lanao fol¬
lowed about the latter part of the
same month, and at the end of 1935,
these two places harvested enough
to prove that cotton growing could
be profitable. To-day cotton planta¬
tions are found in Iligan, Kolambu¬
gan, Malabang, Momungan, and
along the northern coast of Minda¬
nao. At Malabang and Momungan
alone, there are about three hundred
hectares planted to cotton already.
What are the advantages of a
cotton crop? For one thing it is a
five-to-six-month crop. The leaves
are attacked by locusts but they do
not find it good food and leave it
alone without considerable damage.
Then, cotton is resistant to drought.
There are short dry spells in Min¬
danao. The farmers plant the crop
in such a way that the blooming
stage coincides with the dry spell.
The plants mature in from 70 to
80 days. Cotton, thus, will increase
the income of the small farmer by
the utilization of his spare time
that is usually wasted when food
crops alone are planted.
Cotton would make good garden

flowers. Like “everlasting” flo¬
wers, they don’t fade. The petals
turn from white to pink and finally
to red, then fall. What is left is
the capsule containing the cotton
bolls. These then grow into bigger
bolls ready to be picked.
In Mindanao the farmers buy the
seeds from the Bureau of Plant In¬
dustry. They must plant these as
early as possible since cotton seeds
easily lose their vitality. The oil
in the cotyledons causes quick fer¬
mentation and as a result plants
don’t grow well, if at all, if seeds
are kept too long in storage. The
climate generally must be warm
with enough moisture to keep up
normal growth. Few plants are at¬
tacked during the dry season by
plant pests.
Planting at present is under the
direct supervision of the officials of
the Bureau of Plant Industry. This
is done to insure success while the
industry is still in its experimental
stage. The more successful farmers
are the Ilocano immigrants of Min¬
danao because their experience in
cotton planting and harvesting in
the Ilocos helps them here. It is
hoped that the success of the cotton
industry in Mindanao would encou¬
rage more immigrants to come.

NLY six of the eighty-eight
teachers who reported for
O military training at Tagbi¬
laran, Bohol, were not accepted
due to physical defects. The rest
are now quartered at the high
school building and are fast learn¬
ing the rudiments and some of the
finer points of military science and
tactics.
The enthusiasm shown by the
Bohol teachers is patent proof that
military training is not abhorred by
our people. A day before the open¬
ing of the camp, teachers from all
parts of the island-province literal¬
ly poured into Tagbilaran, the pro¬
vincial capital. Registration was
finished at around 9 o’clock in the
morning of April 15th, after which
the teachers were assembled at the
library hall.
Captain Ruperto Kangleon, P.A.,
supervisor of the work in the camp,
delivered a speech, explained Presi¬
dent Quezon’s plan of national de¬
fense and enumerated the things
expected of teachers attending the
camp. Lt. Matias Lingsangan, P.A.,
assistant to the commandant, ex¬
plained the nature of the different
courses to be given during the 30-
day training. Captain Halili, com¬
mandant of the camp, welcomed the
teachers.
The rest of the day was spent in
the organization and orientation of
the recruits, as well as in the initia¬
tion of each into his daily duties.

How Manila Keeds Clean


HOW MANY PEOPLE DO THE
CLEANING AND HOW MUCH
IT COSTS MANILANS
By DELFIN DE VERA


-ANY unemployed men who
want to impress prospec¬
A tive employers will not
hesitate to say that they will ac¬
cept "any kind of work under the
sun." It sounds heroic, but ask
them if they would accept a job as
garbage or pail collectors—or
even as street cleaners—and these
men who are not afraid to tackle
“any kind of work under the sun"
will call it quits.
We have the case of a young man
who, it is said, applied for work to
Secretary Vargas. Serretary Var¬
gas recommended him te Mayor Po¬
sadas, ant' the mayor assigned him
to the pail collecting business. What
happened next, you have guessed
right: the young man never show-
ed up for the work.


Not that these jobs do not pay
well. no. Some of these public ser¬
vants receive as much as P2.20 a day
—a night, rather. That looks like
a fat sum if one is unemployed.
There is another reason: the social
stigma attached to these jobs. To
be called a basurero, for instance, is
considered a slap on the face.
Indispensable
These garbage and pail collectors
and street cleaners who do the dirty


job are the most insignificant of
our public servants. But they are
not actually as insignificant as they
may seem, which they proved not
long ago in Manila when they stag¬
ed a one-night strike—and left the
city stinking a good part of the next
morning.
If you are a resident of Manila—
especially in the congested districts
—try to imagine how the city would
look and smell if the garbage cans
and waste pails remain uncollected
for a whole week and the streets are
not swept for the same period. Even
the entire perfumes of Araby would
not be able to cover the stink.
Two divisions of the department
of engineering and public works of
the city of Manila take care that no
such calamity would descend upon
Manila: the division of sanitation,


transportation, parks, cemeteries,
and public grounds; and the divi¬
sion of streets and bridges. The
section of garbage collection and dis¬
posal and the section of pail conser¬
vancy system belong to the first di¬
vision.
Efficient Workers
One hundred and thirteen men col¬
lect and dispose of the city gar¬
bage. Rather a small number for
so many residents, perhaps. But


A city street cleaner at wark. He
contributes a lot toward making Manila a
fit place to live in.


was not your garbage can emptied
last night? It seems incredible that
so few men could do so much work
in so brief a time. Garbage col¬
lectors work only in the night so as
not to offend the nostrils of sensi¬
tive residents in the city.
From January 1, 1935, to Nov¬
ember 14, 1935, 88,860 tons or 177,-
720 cubic meters of garbage were
collected in the city of Manila. Have
you ever wonderd where they put
so much refuse? Here is the ans¬
wer: 88,281 tons were used to fill
up low portions of the city; 579
tons were reduced to ashes at the
Palomar Crematory.
Garbage collection and disposal
cost the city of Manila during that
104-month period the sum of
₱171,917.24. This means that the
actual cost of collection and dis¬
posal (without overhead expenses)
was P0.93 a cubic meter; with
overhead expenses (this includes
part of the salaries of the section
of general office force) P0.95 a
cubic meter. With an estimated
population of 345,162, the cost per
capita was P0.54 during that entire

building is needed ta accommedate the growing number of readers.


NEBU'S pub'ic library, one of
the oldest and biggest
O branches of the National
Library and Museum, is in dire
need of a new building, present¬
able and spacious enough to ac¬
commodate an ev er- increasing
reading public. But the many pe
titions presented to the provincial
board of Cebu by the general pub¬
lic and librarian to give the local
library a “break” have been per¬
sistently pigeonholed.
Housed In Old Building
The Cebu public library was open¬
ed by Mr. Guillermo Restua, its
first librarian, 'way back in 1919.
Since then, it has been housed in a
dilapidated bui ding which used to
be a convent during the Spanish
days. The lower portion of the

building is presently occupied by

one can well visualize how incon¬

is a fire.
The deplorable condition of the
building, long pronounced by en¬
gineers as in constant peril of col¬
lapsing, does not speak favorably
of the public library of the so¬
called "second city in the Philip-
pines."
Besides a new spacious building,
the Cebu library needs more per¬
sons who know how to handle books
and run a library. Except for Mrs.
Flavia S. Muana, who has been its
librarian since 1925, and her as¬
sistant, Mr. Caylan, no others are
taking charge of Cebu’s library.
There are two other male employees
in the library, but these are on'y
janitors and practically know no¬
thing of running a library.
Inadequate
Slightly second to the Iloilo branch
library in so far as the number of
volumes is concerned, the Cebu pub-
lic library deserves the fullest at¬
tention of the government. The pre-
sent space which it occupies isn’t
even enough to accommodate its
9,000 volumes and 66 periodica’s.
The library lacks shelves, chairs,

The average attendance of the
Cebu library is 300 readers daily.
But there are only fifty chairs, or
even less, and some eight tables.
Hence, when the library is crowd-
ed, which almost always happens
every day, many of the readers have
to scan the news of the week by
standing.
The library has the greatest num¬
ber of periodica s among branch
libraries in the country to-day. The
government of Cebu spends not less
than P350 for yearly subscriptions
of foreign and domestic papers and


magazines. It has 50 American
pericdicals and about twenty domes¬
tic papers in English, Spanish, and
vernacular papers.
The Cebu library has also perhaps
the greatest number of law books
among other public libraries in the
province. Too, it has the distinc-
tion of having complete sets of
such valuable books as the Diccio¬
nario Enciclopedico Hispano-Ameri¬
cano, Blair and Robertson’s History
of the Philippines, and Concepcion’s

WHY SEGREGATE LEPERS?


Ex-Leper Asks - Social Ostracism
Not True It Is Clamed
By ELADIO J. AME


President Quezon: wants leprosy
stations seattered all over Islands.
FrHE Nolasco bill which would
have given freedom to the
I lepers of Culion was turned
down in the legislature last year
for some reasons and one of these
is that the freed lepers would be


ostracized in society upon their re¬
lease. The supposition that lepers
would be inflicted greater cruel¬
ties once they are freed, or that
they would find themselves shun-
ned by non-lepers is absolutely
without truth.
During the last eight years since
I left the Culion Leper Colony, I
have been engaged in finding out
for myself the reactions of people
to lepers and ex-lepers, and in ex¬
tracting from them their own opi¬
nion on a subject which is of vital
importance to lepers.
In the province of Laguna, for
instance, I personally experienced
the fact that the people do not shun
the lepers and ex-lepers. Although
some of them believe that leprosy
is contagious, they, however, do not
dread those who are afflicted with
it. They know for one thing that
the disease is not as dreadful as tu¬
berculosis.
In the province of Rizal, lepers
are practically left to themselves,
unmolested. Some of them have

people of this province loathe those
who are tuberculous more than le¬
pers or ex-lepers.
I have associated with people of
different social standing and have
befriended some of them. Many of
them are professionals and many
are prominent in their respective
communities. Of course, I came
across a few who abhorred my com¬
pany or who believed that leprosy
is highly contagious. But they were
few.
I have also lived with a practis¬
ing physician who, because he was
a bachelor, enjoyed my company.
We enjoyed happy moments toge¬
ther and we used to go around in
his own car. In my association
with him, he did not in the least
show anything to make me believe
that I am some one to be dreaded
and feared, or to remind me that I
am an ex-leper.
These cases only show definitely
that lepers, once they are released,
will find themselves welcome in so¬
ciety.
A great many people have gone as


PRESIDENT QUEZON ON
LEPROSY STATIONS
"I was very favorably im¬
pressed by the leprosaria that I
saw in Iloilo. The patients
there are happy and contented.
Their children sing and play like
normal children. I was the more
impressed by what I saw in
these leprosaria because years
ago I had been to Culion and s
saw how gloomy and m’serable
are the patients in their isola¬
tion which is in itself worse
than the disease. The contrast
between Culion and these lepro¬
saria that I saw is such that as
far as I am concerned, Culion is
finished. We should have, in¬
stead, leprocaria all over the

ESTABLISHMENT OF LEPRO-
SY STATIONS ASKED
The leprosy commission, com¬
posed of le ding leprologists and
high officials of the bureau of
health, recommended last year
the abolition of the Culion Le¬
per Colony and the appropria¬
tion of ₱100,000 to start the
establishment of small lepro¬
sy stations in diffenent sections
of the Archipelago.
The government yearly ex¬
pends approximately P600,000
for leprosy work.
The government presently
maintains six treatment stations.
According to the February,
1936, reports of the bureau of
health there are 8,584 lepers
confined in the different lepro¬
saria of the Philippines.
Below is a list of the different
stations, together with the num¬
ber of patients confined in each:
Culion Leper Colony 6,858


San Lazaro Hospital 579
Eversly Childs Treat¬
ment Staton .... 699
Bicol Treatment Sta¬
tion ............ 198
Western Visayas
Treatment Station. 281
Mindanao Central
28
Treatment Station.


Lepers. For them, President Quezon
says, seiation is worse than the disease.


far as to blame the government for
foolishly segregating our lepers,
contending that the practice of seg¬
regation is a grave blunder because
it is a great waste of money. It is
safe to venture here, however, that
the liberation of our lepers would
lessen the heavy burden of our gov-
ernment and would undoubtedly
ease the minds of our financial of-
ficials.

N SPITE of discouraging world
market conditions and ad¬
A verse Congressional legisla
tions, the sugar industry still
occupies a prominent place in the
economic life of the Philippines. This
is not hard to see, especially if one
realizes that over 2,000,000 (Phil¬
ippine Sugar Association’s estim¬
ate) people in the Philippines are
dependent upon sugar. The gov-
ernment annually collects P20,471,-
000 in the form of taxes from the
industry. The amount represents
43% of the total revenue of the
Philippine government. Also,
it has been estimated that
over P24,000.000 are being
paid every year by centrals
and plantation owners as
salaries and wages of em¬
ployees and laborers en¬
gaged in the industry. It
may also be added that
sugar represents, as it did
in 1934, 61% of the total
exports of the Philippines.
The rapid strides attain-
ed by this industry in the
past is due to the progres¬
siveness of those who are
guiding it. Sugar associa¬
tions have sent technical
men abroad to study market
conditions, scientific farm¬
ing methods and envoys to
the American capital at the
time when the quota for
Philippine sugar was being
discussed in Washington.
At the present time, the
Philippine Sugar Associa¬
tion maintains an office in
Washington and is known
to be paying a competent
attorney in that city to
defend the interests of the
industry.
One of those associations
which have taken active
part in the promotion of
the industry is the Confe¬
deration of Associations of
Sugar Planters, Inc. It is,
according to its officials,
the most influential and
the best recognized asso¬
ciation of sugar planters in the
Philippines. To-day, there are
about 50 associations of sugar
planters in the Philippines. About
60% of these are members of the
Confederation of Associations of
Sugar Planters, Inc.
At the head of this important or-
ganization is Salvador Benedicto,
who succeeded Amando Avancena
as president of the Confederation a
few months ago.
President Benedicto, whose ge¬
nial ways have won for him a wide
circle of friends among govern¬
ment officials was born in La Car¬
lota. Occidental Negros, on March
31, 1899. He is the son of Don Felix
Benedicto and Dona Orosia Vaiois


de Benedicto, both members of pro¬
minent and highly respected fami¬
lies in I oilo and Negros. Don Fe¬
lix Benedicto was a wealthy sugar
planter.
Salvador Benedicto studied in
the public schools of his home town
and later went to the Instituto de
Molo, Alma Mater of many promi¬
nent Filipinos, and obtained his
A.B. degree from that institution.
As a student, he was interested in
law. He applied himself so whole
heartedly to it that at the age of
25 he was appointed justice of the


--


Salvador Benedicto
President, Confederation of Asseciatons
of Sugar Planters, Inc.


peace of La Carlota. He acted as
such from 1914 to 1916 and was
so enthusiastic about his job that
he forgot to come to Manila to take
up a regular law course.
When he reached the age of
twenty seven, the fascination of law
had worn out in him. He turned
to the soil and like his father,
farming became a passion with him.
Given a vast tract of land through
inheritance to start with, Benedic-
to soon became known as one of
the most progressive sugar plant¬
ers in the region. To-day, he is
known as one of the most progres¬
sive and one of the richest hacen¬
deros in the district of Ma-ao.
The application of scientific


farming methods, cultivation on a
large scale, the adoption of modern
methods of harvesting, and the ap-
plication of the latest farming im¬
plements used in the United States
and Cuba, have placed him in the
fore in the most important indus¬
try in the Philippines. Believing
in the advantages of diversifica¬
tion, he has planted fruit-bearing
trees and other crops in land not
suitable to sugar cane. While other
planters of Occidental and Orient¬
a Negros are allowing sections of
their farms not adapted to sugar
cane to remain uncultivat¬
ed, Salvador Benedicto is
taking advantage of the
technical knowledge of col¬
lege-trained agriculturists
in making those sections
productive. He has a large
program of diversification
for his pantations and is
intending to introduce un
tried crops in his farms.
He has a I s o started,
with the technical assis¬
tance of college graduates,
poultry, hog, and pigeon
raising in a modern and
scientific way. Whatever
future the sugar industry
has, therefore, does not bo¬
ther President Benedicto
much.
With his knack for orga¬
nization, he was instru¬
mental in the formation of
what is to-day the greatest
farming organization in
the country, the Confede¬
ration of Associations of
Sugar Planters, Inc. The
services rendered by this
organization since it was
founded seven years ago
for the sugar industry are
incalculable.
Salvador Benedicto was
for two consecutive terms
president of the Ma-ao Su¬
gar Planters' Association.
The board of directors of
the Confederation elected
him first vice president of
the organication in its
first election, a position which he
held for three consecutive years.
He is the head of the Manila office
of the organization, and was the
one who was in direct contact with
the Sugar Administration office, at
the time when sugar benefit pay¬
ments were being arranged.
Bened cto was a member of the
sub-committee on sugar a body or
ganized to formulate the basis for
the coming Philippine-American
trade parley. As part of his am¬
b'tious program to consol date the
agricultural interests of the coun¬
try. Mr. Benedicto with the coope¬
ration of his co leagues has orga¬
nized the “Confederacion Nacional
de Agricultores," an entity whose


main object is to protect the inte¬
rests of the Filipino farmer and
help solve the various and intri¬
cate problems which will arise
with the establishment of the
Commonwealth.
After serving as first vice presi¬
dent of the Confederation of As¬
sociations of Sugar Planters, Bene¬
dicto was recently elected president
of the organization, succeeding
Amando Avancena.
Mr. Benedicto is married to the
former Miss Hortencia Salas of
Bago, Occidental Negros. He has
two sons. Marciano, an engineering
student; and Roberto, a law stu¬
dent.

Hof-seaf
A young traffic patrolman of
Manila approached Captain Nie¬
vera of the traffic department, Ma¬
nila police, and asked for the job
vacated recently by a motor cycle
cop who was suspended by Chief
Torres.
"Are you sure you want the
job?” Captain Nievera asked.
“Yes sir!”
“But that’s a hot-seat job. And
you are liable to get burned."
The young man got cold feet and
hastily excused himself.
Envelope
“I want to see Don Andres," a
stranger told the lady clerk in the
anteroom of San Miguel Brewery’s
Andres Soriano.
The lady a charming mestiza,
frowned at him and said, "I am
sorry You will have to wait. See
those gentlemen there? They have
been waiting for hours to see Don
Andres."
“But I have a letter for him,”
the stranger insisted and produced
a sealed envelope carrying the of¬
ficial stationery of the Office of
the President, Commonwealth of
the Philippines. “I want to see
him personally in connection with
this letter.
“Oh,” the lady bit her lips. "You
came from Malacanang? Please,
this way.” She led him to another
door, and ushered him into Andres
Soriano’s presence.
Imagine the chagrin of the lady
clerk when, after a lapse of one
minute, she was called in and
handed a letter "File this—no
vacancy.” the San Miguel Brewery
head said.
It was a letter of recommendation
from a Malacanang employee writ¬
ten on official Malacanang station¬
ery.

T was the front seat she took
when she transferred to an¬
A other bus in Ajuy from Estan
cia. She missed the first bus so
she took the second which neces¬
sitated her transfering to another
bus in Ajuy It was noon and the
heat made her thirsty She went
down to get a drink from a near¬
by store and when she returned she
found a man had taken her seat.
Seeing her, he rose and politely
offered the seat to her. She thanked
him but took the seat next to him.
"Are these yours?” he asked,
placing two packages in a secure
corner under their seats.
“Yes, they are dried fish I’m
taking to my cousin in Iloilo.
He was dressed simply: khaki
pants and white polo shirt. She
noted that his complexion was light.
His eyes, somewhat Chinese. His
voice she thought rather pleasing.
The one thing she especially no¬
ticed. All very feminine—this
curiosity.
He was all friendliness. She had
no objection to this.
“My, it’s hot. I’ve waited here
for a long time and I thought it
would be ages before this bus would
come, he commented.
“I didn’t see you when we arrived
and you said you had waited that
long here.
“I rode in our truck from Sara.
I was in the truck when you came.


She remembered seeing a truck but
she had a vague recollection of the
occupants.
“I like the front seat. It is less
crowded. Only two passengers on
this side, the driver, and one on
the other side. It’s a long way to
our town and I feel comfortable in
this place,” she told him.
Do you go to Iloilo frequently?”
he asked.
"No, only when I buy medicine
for father who is sick.
“I have a friend in Estancia. Do
you know Antonio Belmonte?”
He is our neighbor. He is liv¬
ing in Iloilo now having married
recently,” she said.
Starting time. Many passengers
were going up and down the other
end of the bus. The man and wo¬
man in front looked at each other
gratefully for their uncrowded
seats. On the way another bus was
encountered. A company checker
got down. She recognized a friend
from her town coming down from
the other bus towards her.
“Martin has arrived from Ma¬
nila. I met him this morning. I told
him I met you in a Chinese store
and he lost no time looking for you.
He wouldn’t think it was a joke now
that you are bound for Iloilo.
She was not able to say anything.
She only smiled. All the while her
mind was full of so many things


known only to her.
The bus started again. So did
the other bus. From the other bus
her friend waved good-bye.
They were now nearing the wind-
ing road at San Nicolas. He was
telling her of the different kinds of
flowers in their farm in Sara. He
asked her if she was also interested
in flowers. Absent-mindedly she
said yes.
“There are days that seem so
good. Sometimes we feel so happy
without knowing why. Has that
ever happened to you?” He asked.
She turned to him. She was won¬
dering why he had asked her that
And the question was so unexpected
she could not answer. And she
just smiled.
In the next town she bought a
copy of “The World” from a news¬
boy who was shouting his papers
at the top of his voice. She scanned
the pages eagerly. He stole cur¬
ious glances at her.
She offered him the newspaper.
He took it without hesitation for
he was beginning to feel the mono¬
tony of the trip.
“By the way, who is the editor
of this paper?” he asked.
For an answer, she turned the
pages over to the first leaf and in¬
dicated with her finger: Martin
Cruz—Editor.
“Isn’t he from your place also?”


he inquired.
She laughed slightly and he won-
dered why.
He is my husband," she said
finally.
A group of passengers hailed the
bus. The car was nearly full. Once
more the man and the woman looked
at each other Once more they were
thankful they had the front seats.
He studied her in the long sil¬
ence that followed. Just a wisp of a
girl, about twenty-two Rather
young, he thought. It was her eyes
he liked most. The mysterious,
sad eyes. All the while he was
wondering what was happening to
him, of all people. He felt a sick-
ening pain with the sudden realiza¬
tion.
He was a man.
“I believe you are married too.
How do you find married life?” she
asked him.
“Oh, but I am not married!” He
seemed embarrassed and they both
laughed.
“Getting off here?” he asked,
when they reached Iloilo.
"No Im going to Molo with
this bus. I’ll spend the night there
with my cousin," she told him.
“And I’m going there too. Where
does your cousin live?
“Mapa street. Near the plaza."
"Our house is right there. The
one with the briak walls. Only
mother and I live there. We have

INNER at home was always
a noisy affair Maybe, it
was because dinner-time was
the only time we ever met during
the whole day By we I mean the
members of the family I won’t
say our family or my family be¬
cause these sound grown-up and,
therefore, out of place. There was
Inay and there was Itay. I should
not be saying Inay for Nanay and
Itay for Tatay if Tia Sixta were
within hearing, but as the coast is
clear I would rather not suppress
my taste. The truth of it is that
I promised Tia Sixta never to say
Inay and Itay again because Tia
said it was bad taste and indicated
laziness and disrespect. Dad—I
also called Itay Dad—who was at
the head of the table did not think
so and said Itay sounded pretty


a radio to amuse us."
"Perhaps that’s the one I often
hear when I stay with my cousin,
she said.
When they reached Molo, she
said: “Well, here we are. She told
the driver to stop. He gathered
her things and helped her get
down.
She thanked him and bade him
bood-bye.
YYER thoughts as she traveled
AA homeward were on yesterday’s
incident. She pictured two men. One
she thought of with mingled pleas¬
ure and pain. The other she
thought of with a sense of guilt.
There was the concrete house with
the radio playing. Then there
were the walls.
BRICK WALLS.
She knew she would never dare
get within those brick walls.
NEVER.
There must always be brick walls
between them.
ALWAYS.


good; malambing, (caressing) that
was the word he said. I felt quite
complimented but Tia Sixta who
would come in any moment from
the kitchen would disagree and so,
what’s the use? Itay had a good
appetite always, because it was Inay
who cooked and as Itay said Inay
was the best cook ever We all
thought so, too. Inay was always
being complimented at the table but
she never blushed. Barbara said
she did not see why Mother should
blush when she deserved the
praise. I thought Mother did not
blush because she did not hear the
praise at all; she was busy attend-
ing to Tito who used his left hand
eating and Elsa who was stretch-
ing her arms far across the table
for bananas. Itay would eat and
eat as if he hadn’t had a meal for
days, but would put his spoon and
fork down on seeing Big Brother
Inong. It was Inong’s hair again
Dad said it was like a nest and
that did not sound complimentary
at all. Some of us would laugh at
the remark and we won’t wonder if
Inong ran to a barber shop right
after dinner. But we also knew that
at tomorrow’s dinner, Itay would
notice Inong’s hair again and in
spite of Brother’s recent haircut,
Itay would make his remark about
the nest.
Ruth and Barbara and I were
quiet at dinner Good young ladies
always are. Of course, we contri¬
buted jokes but we would rather eat.
Being in school was so tiring and
cooking at any of the restaurants
on Florida Street was not even half
as good as Mother’s.
Fe was never at the table at that
beginning of the meal. She was
sure to be downstairs at this time
with Puppy Fe was popularly
known as Tomboy because she
played boy’s games with boys and
because she was so sturdy and
strong. She was only eleven. Puppy
was not a puppy anymore but we
called him that just as Big Brother
Inong is still Totoy to Mother.


Now, there seems to be something
the matter with me, I know that I
have a story in mind, but it seems
I cannot put it in words.
As I started out to say, dinner
at home was always a noisy affair.
That was long ago. Maybe, there
is no story after all... Only, it
seems ages since the family last
gathered for one of those delight-
ful, noisy dinners we were won’t to
have.
Tia Sixta is long past dead. Poor
old soul! She never quite succeeded
in making me say Nanay and Tatay.
Puppy has been dead all these
years, but I do not miss Puppy. I
have never been a dog fancier, any¬
way.
We have all grown up. At least,
Tito who is the youngest among
us has already started schooling
and Inong who is oldest is married.
Inong is now head of his family
and maybe, at his dinner table, he
is telling his oldest son, Bert, to
get a haircut because his hair
(Bert’s) looks like a nest. Elsa is
the envy of school children. She
is bright in class and can dance and
sing, besides. Fe is still Tomboy
to us but already she has a
number of boys dogging her heels.
Ruth, Barbara, and I are quite the
same except that now we wonder
about life and often ask ourselves
if this is living. Ruth keeps house
for us. Barbara is still studying
in college. I am looking for work
and I ought to feel disappointed at
my seeming failure to land a job,
but I am not.
Let me end up with Inay and Itay.
I started with them in the first
place, so it is meet that I end with
them.
Inay is of course older. Maybe
she is worried, but she still has her
look of calmness. You know, that
serene look of hers—as if nothing
ever hurts at all, as if nothing out
of the ordinary ever happens. She
still cooks as she used to and we
all still think her the best cook ever
but I doubt whether our compli¬


ments make up for those Dad
would have made were he here. You
see, Itay has been gone all this time.
He is in the States, in California,
perhaps; he sends us money, but
what do we care for money now?
There is no knowing if there is any
coming back.
It seems ages since the family
last gathered for one of those de¬
lightful, noisy dinners we were
won’t to have.

(EYT'S not really a betrothal
party. But, I shall have to
A announce generally that Clau¬
dia Gray is engaged to marry An¬
dre Donat or, else, there will be all
sorts of gossip. The child has
danced only with him the whole
evening; and they have so many
sympathizers among our friends.
Even Charles seems to like the
idea.
Mrs. Gray looked around the
room for her husband and finally
spotted him at a poker table. “Yes,
of course, he’s passing his thumb
nail across his lip. He’s at it again!
Last week I didn’t catch him at it
a single time. I suppose it’s be¬
cause things are going so smoothly
and he’s bored.” She sighed, and
gazed thoughtfully at Andre Donat
and her daughter who were dancing
to the music of a pianola. Claudia
looked like her mother. She was
large like her and had the same
blonde coloring that her mother had
at her age.
“Blondness—that doesn’t last
long!” thought her mother. “That
type of blonde fades out quickly. I
ought to know something about
that. But the child is really very
pretty to-night. Quite worthy of
her mother. It’s positively discon-
certing how much her face is like
mine at her age, in spite of those
delicate features. Her nose is
smaller than mine, and, unfortun¬
ately, so are her eyes. But she has
a smaller mouth, too, thank good-
ness! She’s really lovely. I can
take the credit for producing a mas¬
terpiece. And she’s so dear and
sweet. Ah, how well I know that
life will be over for me when she
goes. But there I go singing her
praises as if—
She called an abrupt halt to her
maternal reverie and touched, with
a superstitious finger, the gilded
wood of an armchair.
Mrs. Gray felt for her daughter
a singular devotion, a devotion so
discerning that it was incapable of
blindness. It had in it that element
of keen criticism which a coach
must always assume towards the
champion whom he trains and
trusts. Mrs. Gray’s own abundant
health, her physical and moral equi¬
librium had, indeed, often made her
intolerant and harsh toward femi¬
nine frailties that she did not share.
“You have a headache! And where
in the world did you pick up a
headache? I never had one in my
life.” Or again, “You want to wear
your hair low, in the nape of your
neck? You little fool! Nothing in
the world is less becoming at your
age. You should wear your hair
high and leave your neck bare.
That’s the style for you. Just take
a look at my portrait painted by
Ferdinand Humbert!”
In the person of her daughter,
Mrs. Gray was unconsciously cher¬
ishing those others: the child of ten
years before, with short skirts and
bare legs wading in icy water; the
girl of just a few years past, rid¬
ing on horseback in the Bois with


her hair in a double braid under her
black derby hat. A charming lit¬
tle girl always, easy to bring up,
a bit of a tomboy perhaps, but
spirited as a pedigreed horse, and
slim and straight as a young sap¬
ling, a girl who did not know what
it was to have nerves and who had
not been the occasion of three doc-
tor’s visits since her birth.
Mrs. Gray looked towards her
future son-in-law with the dispa¬
raging and resentful eye of a
mother-in-law.
“Yes; he seems a good sort. And
his bread is well buttered. His
father will give them a house. Other
mothers will be quite envious. This
marriage will create nothing but


envy, I know. And if I should speak
my secret thoughts, there would be
a fine outcry."
Andre Donat, leaving the pianola
a moment for the buffet, stopped
in front of Mrs. Gray and, bend¬
ing low, printed a light kiss on her
hand. Then he snatched her tiny
handkerchief and made off with it,
laughing and showing his teeth.
Mrs. Gray threatened him with her
fan and smiled at him—entirely
without good will.
She went outside on the terrace,
sat down, and breathed in the fresh
air, which was not entirely free
from the evening dust of the Bois.
Her fifty rigorous years had not
left her quite untouched, and she


gave in to them a little now and
then when she felt herself quite
alone. Her knees felt weak and
her proud back longed for her bed
with its fresh linens and for a nice
soothing hot water bag.
“He plays the gallant with me,
that boy! How many times he has
done it! He shows me those white
teeth in his upper jaw and those
tiny incisors in his lower jaw.
They’re too small and pointed and
they denote sensuality and fickle¬
ness. I pity my child if she has
pretty chambermaids around. And
that short nose shows a complete
lack of judgment, and the lobe of
his ear almost growing onto his
cheek—a sure sign of degeneracy!
Besides, when we have visited him,
he has positively boasted of the
fact that he cannot live in disor-
der; that he arranges his books
according to the color of the bind-
ings and that he even gets up at
night to put shoe trees in his
shoes.”
Mrs. Gray groaned as she rose.
She recalled to her mind a scene
from her own youth, the picture of
a young girl completely crushed
and, standing in front of her in his
underwear, a young man with his
bare feet on the tiles of a bath
house. With complete nonchalance,
the young man was about to make
the horrid admission that he could
not sleep unless the bath towels
were all hung in an exactly even
row.
“But I can’t tell that to Claudia!"
thought Mrs. Gray in the torment
of her soul. “No! I positively can¬
not! If I should tell her that and
also that I almost left her father
because he keeps passing his thumb
nail over his lip, she would laugh.
She wouldn’t understand. It’s one
of those things you just can’t say.
There are things that I must whis¬
per in her ear on the eve of her
marriage: things that are a little
shocking and frightening for a
young girl to hear and awkward
for a mother to talk about with her
daughter. But I can never tell her
about the fringes of the bath to¬
wels or that thumb nail passed over
his lip a hundred times a day—
never! never! And she, she will con¬
ceal from me a thousand terrible lit-
tle nothings, the dry rot of conjugal
life, the lapses into childishness of
a husband who begins to feel com¬
fortable and relaxed.
“My poor baby!" sighed Mrs.
Gray, and drew up her large form.
which as it lost flexibility seemed
to gain in stateliness. As she re-
entered the room she made only the
tiniest sign to the engaged couple
who were now dancing and went
straight to the poker table.
“Make room for me, Charles.
There are only four of you."
She sat down opposite her hus¬
band; and her wifely hand removed
with a quick significant gesture
that hand which was rubbing its
thumb nail slowly, slowly across the
lips.

OLETTE is one of the most popular of contemporary French
writers. With so many of her works translated into
English, she has a following on both sides of the At¬
lantic. “Secrets,” which shows with Continental sophistica¬
tion that there are some things a mother cannot tell even her
about-to-be-married daughter, not because they are unmen¬
tionable but because they are inexplicable, first appeared in
Vanity Fair (now combined with Voque) and was subsequently
reprinted in “Stories from Vanity Fair.”

Y OT one, but many, have come
out advocating the conver¬
A " sion of the Philippines into
something like Fascist Italy, with
a dictator at the head of the gov¬
ernment. For those who have but
a hazy idea of what present-day
Italy is, we are quoting from
Alice Robe (Why 1 Fled Italy),
former manager of the Rome bu¬
reau of the United Press:
"And now—I thought of Ita¬
ly, from whose radiant face the
smile has been wiped, whose
lyric voice silenced, whose free
will stifled. And I thought of
the will-destroying beat of that
insistent, unceasing note, ‘II
Duce says,” 'Believe, Obey,
Fight.' From birth to death,
from dawn to midnight, always
his face is before them—in
homes, in stores, on every wall
and building.
“I thought of babies lisping
Duce’ as they played with the
new Fascist military toys; of
tiny boys, newest Fascist-or¬
ganized cohorts, Sons of the
Wolf, drilling to the chant of
Duce', of regimented girls and
women marching on their di¬
rected way, murmuring "Du¬
ce.””

“The custom in the White House
is that the President, out of his
salary, pays for all food for the ser¬
vants and for the family with their
unofficial guests, but an official
entertainment, where both political
parties are represented, is paid out
of a government fund. If the Pres¬
ident invites a number of Senators
for breakfast or lunch, he must be


Mrs Franklin D. Roosevelt: tells
us an interesting White Hause cus¬
tom.


sure not to have them all of one po¬
litical faith. Otherwise he pays for
the meal out of his pocket."—Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
*
After all, it is no fun having an
Emperor to adore. Of Japan and
her Emperor, Sydney Greenbie
writes in The American Mercury:


Dictator Mussolini: in whose country
beats the unceasing note: “I Duce says."


“Newspapers which print Impe¬
rial Household without capital let¬
ters are suppressed. No man, or
image of a man, may be placed
above the Emperor if he is passing.
When the Emperor’s car goes by,
all blinds must be drawn, no one
may remain on balcony or roof,
workers on steel structures must
scurry to the ground, blinds in
streetcars must be drawn, and no
person may stand upon even an
eight-inch doorstep.”
Something like this should be
introduced here for the residents
of Paco, San Nicolas, and Tondo
where uncollected garbage are no
uncommon sights in the streets
even at daytime:
“The machine age is displacing
the garbage pail with an electrical
garbage man which works right in
the kitchen. It is a grinder, driven
by an electric motor, which can be
installed under the kitchen sink.
Waste, placed inside, is shredded by
knives and reduced to a fine pulp
which is flushed away by water in-
to the sewage stream."
.. .Another odd little item
(about the U. S. Supreme Court
building) is the fact that the cor¬
ridors are furnished with approxi¬
mately the same number of ash
trays as No Smoking signs.”—Life.
Our own legis’ative building
has as many cuspidors as ‘No
Spitting’ signs when Quintin Pare¬
des was the house speaker.
Upon entering Helsingfors, cap¬
ital of Finland, one is struck by the
incredible quiet of this city. It is
not the quietness of stagnation, for
the traffic of business and pleasure
flows briskly and there are plenty
of people, motor cars, and buses. It is
quiet because a number of years ago
the Finns worked out and put into
operation a program of noise abate¬
ment such as London has only re¬
cently and very partially adopted.
In Helsingfors no motor car sounds
a horn, no steamer whistles, no fac-
tory hoots, no bicycle-bell rings.
There are no sirens, gongs, carril¬
lons, street cries, blaring radios, or
racket of any kind. In this tran¬
quillity nervous tension relaxes


slowly, blessedly, permanently. The
number of motor accidents has al¬
so been greatly reduced.—Agnes
Rothery.
There isn’t any doubt Manila
will become drab and tasteless to
provincianos if Mayor Posadas
and Police Chief Torres put their
heads together and turn the city
into an Oriental Helsingfors. But
the place will be a healthier place
to live in.

A year ago the prospective sce¬
nario writer Henry Glimf began to
write his first talkie manuscript.
He had no money at all then. To-
day he has half a million dollars in
the bank.
Glimf’s scenario did not contain
the following essential elements of
a talkie: the little actor or actress
who becomes a famous star; a se¬
ries of mysterious murders in the
night; a few songs about mother
and child; a criminal converted by
the love of a pure virgin; the co¬
median who plays comedy while his
beloved is dying; a company direc¬
tor who marries his secretary. In
spite of these deficiencies it was a


good story. You can still buy it,
for Glimf is still offering it for
sale. The half million dollars he
made by inventing a practical de¬
vice for peeling potatoes.—Der
Querschnitt, Berlin.

We either go too hard after a
government job or we simply are
too lazy to scratch the surface of
our rich farms. At any rate, here’s
NEPA idealism, as practised in
Japan:
When I returned from immersion
in the delectable depths of the neck-
deep Japanese bath, I found that
the bed had already disappeared
into a cupboard. The room which
had so recently been a bedroom
was in a fair way to becoming a
dining room. Cushions had been
placed on the floor around an an¬
kle-high table.
Presently the servant and Mrs.
Machida entered, bearing steaming
bowls. We all sat down on our heels
to a meal of bean-soup, rice with
eels, sweet omelet, sweet potatoes
cooked in sugar, lotus, bamboo,
white radish, pickled chrysanthe¬

SOAP
Its use is an evidence of fine discrimination. In
aroma, in quality, in everything that goes to make up
a bath soap—It is superior to all others.
It produces the finest lather, cleanses thorough-
ly and quickly. It gives a feeling of rest and satisfac¬
tion, which makes the bath a delightful pleasure.

mum petals, and a delicate tea made
of cherry blossoms. Not a thing
that had not been raised on their
own farm. Even the eels had been
caught in their own rice paddies.
How large is your farm?” I
asked. “Two acres,” I was told.—

The method used by Berberines
(natives of North Africa employed
as servants in Egypt) to steal an
article is too long and complicated
for some of their colleagues here.
As described by Major C. S. Jarvis:
If one leaves an old camera, field
glasses, gramophone, etc., in an odd
corner for a year or so without use,
this fact is carefully noted by one’s
servant and the article in question
therefore goes into the primary
stage. The second stage tollows:
the object is removed for six months
to some other part of the house,
and if called for it can be produced
after a short search. The tertiary
stage—also six months—consists of
the temporary removal of the arti¬
cle from the house to the servant’s
quarters. The owner is still aliowed
the right to call for it, when it will
be found in the most unlikely spot
such as the tool-shed or cistern¬
room. If, however, no claim is made
during this final six months the ar¬
ticie is definitely absorbed and will
never be seen again.
* * *
Now wouldn’t you be proud to
be near-sighted, afier reading
this?:
A few years ago Professor Vogt
discovered a peculiar relationship
between the derects in sight and
brain aeveiopment. He found that
far-sightedness and a buiging cor¬
nea go hand in hand with mental
deficiency, especiany with its most
severe form which is known as mon¬
goloidism. On the other hand, near-
sightedness is common among indi¬
viquals whose intelligence ranks
above the average. As near-sight¬
edness is mostiy hereditary and
does not develop from too much
reading or from other occupations
which involve a great strain upon
the eyes, it must depend upon the
development of the brain from the


Girl students in Tokyo, Japan, learn haw to plant rice whi le still in school.
The abave pheto shews a demonstration
how planting is done. No wonder the Japanese hnow how ta rai se what they need


start.—Die Umschau, Frankfurt.
 
And the world would be simpler,
pleasanter to live in if everyone in
our community worries less about
living up to other people's expecta¬
tions of him. As one who found out
says:
More and more I am coming back
to the simple things. I’m growing
tired of very cultured and sophis¬
ticated people, and would rather be
standing at a bar in a country pub
listening to the older men talking
about the crops, and watching the
younger men playing darts or
shove-ha’penny, than attending the
swaggerest or the cleverest party in
London.
I’m getting tired of travelling and
am finding that happiness or sor¬
row, boredom or romance depend
much less upon surroundings than
upon one’s own state of mind. And
one’s mind is most receptive when
one is least tired. And one is least
tired, I believe, when one returns
to the simplest occupations.—Ver¬


non Bartlett.

Alarm has been expressed in
Manila about the increasing num¬
ber of children abandoned on door¬
steps and o'her convenient places.
But the number has to increase
considerably to approach this:


Abandoning children is a com-
mon practice in the United States.
In the United States an infant or
small child is abandoned on the
street or turned over to welfare or¬
ganizations by parents or relatives
on the average of one every fifteen
minutes.—Kadelpian Review.

Saddle Is Equipped With
Cigarette Lighter
Saddles equipped with cigarette
lighters are a recent innovation in
the West. When the rider wants to
light up, she presses the button of
a lighter which is connected to a
small battery concealed in the sad-
dle. Forest rangers believe that
the idea will prevent many forest
fires caused by burning matches.

Fireproof Lumber
Wood that is “practically non¬
combustible and nonflammable,”
described in this manner by the lab¬
oratory of the National Board of
Underwriters after tests, has been
produced by Protexol Corporation.
Walls and floors of lumber treated
with incombustible salts have been
found to act as fire-stops, prevent¬
ing the passage of flame and con¬
fining the fire to its point of or-
igin. The fireproofing properties
last throughout the life of the wood.
Workability of the fireproofed lum-
ber is said to be equal to that of
untreated wood. Ability of the
wood to take paint and varnish is
unchanged and its weight is only
slightly greater. Fireproofed floors
subjected to the intense heat and
flame of gas-fired furnaces came
out blackened and charred on the
exposed surface, but intact and
otherwise sound after extensive
tests.

Foods And Medicines
From The Sea
Candy, pickles, relished, bread.
jellies and jams, flour, sandwich
spread, poultry feed, butter, meat
sauce, stock feed and medicines are
being made from a common weed
that grows in the sea off the Paci¬
fic coast.
In Alaska alone 100 forms of food
are produced from kelp. From
Nome to the Bering Sea the natives
have developed dishes to eat with


their diet of fish, while the In-
dians south of Cordova eat kelp ex¬
tensively.
The sea farms producing kelp are
never threatened with drouth. Ope¬
rators of the self-propelled barges
find that the more they cut, the
faster does the weed grow. The
greatest and most prolific beds are
those of the giant kelp, Macrycystis
pyrifera.
Ingenious automatic machinery
enters into the harvesting. A
barge, some hundred feet long and
thirty feet wide, moves into a bed.
Underwater knives slice off the
tops and an endless belt gathers
them up, carries them aboard the
barge and dumps them on deck.
Although considered a nuisance
by bathers, the kelp supplies more
than forty drugs, a definite control
for two widespread human diseases,
and feeds which increase the size,
weight, and output of both chickens
and cattle.
It is estimated there are 100,000
tons of the better varieties of kelp
available in the marine farms, with
3,000 acres ready for cutting along
the Southern California shore. Two
of the principal products are iodine,
important for treatment of goitre,
and a meal which is used by both
humans and animals.
Kelp, when served as a green
food, has a piquant flavor much like
water cress. When it is dehydrated
before serving, it is often cooked
with meat or fish and served as a
dressing or sauce. When mixed
with other ingredients it makes a
delicious sandwich spread of dis¬
tinctive flavor. Much is expected
of this new branch of sea-farming.

Reading In Bed Easy
With Prism Glasses
Recumbent spectacles have been
designed to make reading in bed
more comfortable and less tiring.
Specially devised prisms reflect the
light clearly, without inversion or
coloring of the image, so that the
reader may hold his book in a com¬


fortable position on the chest and
direct his eyes straight upward in
the normal and least fatiguing
way. The spectacles are especially
valuable to patients forced to lie in
bed for some time. They may be
worn over other spectacles.
* *
Plants Grow Bigger With
Carbon Dioxide
Plants can be made to grow big¬
ger and produce a larger seed yield
by "stuffing” them with carbon
dioxide, the atmospheric gas they
use as initial raw material in food¬
making. This is the finding of Dr.
Earl S. Johnston of the Smithson-
ian Institution after a series of
laboratory experiments in which he
grew wheat plants in open-topped
glass enclosures, maintaining the
carbon-dioxide content of the air at
four times the usual percentage.
The plants produced more stalk and
larger and more numerous heads
than did similar ones in adjoining
containers where only ordinary air
was used. As yet the results have
no practical application because the
cost of raising the carbon-dioxide
content of the air under field con¬
ditions is greater than the worth of
the increased yield.

Arf Lovers Deprived
Art lovers were deprived of one
of their sources of inspiration and
instruction, and the art-loving pub¬
lic of their pleasure, when the oil
paintings hanging inside the Na¬
tional Museum were transferred to
Malacanang Palace. Those paint¬
ings play an important part in the
development and the encourage¬
ment of local art talent. And only
constant study of those paintings
of the masters can make them fine
painters.
I would suggest that an early re¬
turn of those paintings to the Na¬
tional Museum be made.

Shoe Industry Doomed
Marikina’s shoe industry has
shown signs of weakening and,
if the situation is unremedied,
ninety per cent of those engaged in
or dependent on the industry are
due to face financial difficulties.
Several factors tend to undermine
the once-flourishing Marikina
shoe trade.
Firstly, there is quantity produc-
tion but not high quality workman¬
ship. Hence, only Gandara retail¬
ers buy them, to sell them at bar¬
gain prices. Marikina shoemakers
still cling to this "quantity not
quality” slogan, a product of the
post-war boom period when even
hurriedly-made shoes commanded
high prices.
To-day people are conservative
purchasers. Their economic phi¬
losophy is less money for high qual¬
ity. So a person does not do much
Gandara purchasing, but prefers to
wait for the time when he has saved
enough to buy some very service¬
able, nice-appearing foreign-made
shoes.
Others point to lack of capital,
high price of materials, Chinese
retail monopoly, and failure to es¬

Orrick Johns is a name familiar to those who read anthologies of con¬
temporary poetry. The first poem reprinted below is included in “The
Third Book of Modern Verse," edited by Jessie B. Rittenhouse; the other,
in “Today’s Poetry," edited by Nelson Antrim Crawford and David O'Neil.
The Door
L OVE is a proud and gentle thing, a better thing to own
Than all of the wide impossible stars over the heavens
blown,
And the little gifts her hands give are careless given or
taken,
And though the whole great world break, the heart of
her is not shaken.....
Love is a viol in the wind, a viol never stilled,
And mine of all is the surest that ever time has willed.
I shall speak to her though she goes before me into the
grave,
And though I drown in the sea, herself shall laugh upon
a wave;
And the things that love gives after shall be as they
were before,
For life is only a small house... and love is an open door.
Little Things
THERE'S nothing very beautiful and nothing very gay
About the rush of faces in the town by day;
But a light tan cow in a pale green mead,
That is very beautiful, beautiful indeed....
And the soft March wind and the low March mist
Are better than kisses in a dark street kissed....
The fragrance of the forest when it wakes at dawn,
The fragrance of a trim green village lawn,
The hearing of the murmur of the rain at play—
These things are beautiful, beautiful as day!
And I shan’t stand waiting for love or scorn
When the feast is laid for a day new-born.
Oh, better let the little things I loved when little
Return when the heart finds the great things brittle;
And better is a temple made of bark and thong
Than a tall stone temple that may stand too long.
—Orrick Johns


In the April 16th issue of

nym of Luis Quibranza, mentioned
falsely that I was offered a Moro
girl for P50.00, payable in install¬

Before sending it for publication.
Mr. Quibranza should have ap-
proached me and asked about the
correctness or truth of the news.
But he never did; and as it turned
out, the publication was fictitious
and ungrounded.
This matter of fabricating news,
which he also did in the Free
Press where he assumed there was
a great demand for girls in Kolam¬
bugan, has kindled the minds of the
people here, especially the women,
into hating him.
It is only fair therefore that I, a
public school teacher, should answer
Mr. Quibranza through the columns

misleading impressions he has
made, especially the unfounded im¬

A SKIN TRAGEDY


NE of the tragedies that
can happen to an adoles¬
cent is to have pimples or
acne. These skin blemishes usual¬
ly come at the most self-conscious
period in life and bring with them
humiliation and mental distress
and leave scars that may last
throughout life. Before, parents
and even physicians, used to say
about acne, “Oh, don’t worry
about it—it will soon clear up,”
for they considered acne a na¬
tural accompaniment of adoles¬
cence. Now, a pimple is regard¬
ed subconsciously as something
unc'ean, unhealthy, an admission
of unwholesome habits, of impure
blood. Pimples can be prevented,
and when they appear, something
should be done about them.
In any case of acne, it is always
advisable to see a physician and ask
him to locate and treat the causal fac-
tor. Sometimes the cause is found
in pus pockets or foci in other parts
of the body, such as abcessed teeth
infected tonsils. sluggish intes¬
tines. Anemia or a faulty diet
may also be the cause. A dietary
treatment is recognized as a great
aid in the cure of chronic acne.
To understand the correct treat¬
ment for acne, it is important to
know first how acne forms.
Acne is a disease of over-active
oil glands, frequent in the face be¬
cause the oil glands are most sensi¬


tive here, but it also affects the
chest and back. It occurs more oft-
en in an oily skin than a dry one.
A pimple often starts as a black¬
head. A blackhead is a hardened
mass of dirt and oil, and pus is
fat which clogs the pores. Unable
to throw off this hardened mass,
the oil duct enlarges and becomes
inflamed. Germs flourish in this
mass of dirt and oil and pus is
formed. A pimple is the result.
The pimple may ripen quickly, the
pus coming to a head and discharg¬
ing, or it may burrow deeper into
the skin and form a lump which is
sore and red. This type of pimple
is much more troublesome and dif¬
ficult to check. Chronic pimples
become acne.
Advanced or chronic cases of ac¬
ne should be placed under the care
of a dermatologist or a physician.
But for common pimples, you can
do a lot by correct care of your
skin at home. To keep the skin
clean is to prevent blackheads and
pimples.
Acne treatment should be exter¬
nal and internal. The external
treatment aims to restore normal
oil gland function and to eliminate
the pus-forming germs. The fol¬
lowing treatment is recommended
by the beauty clinic of Good House¬
keeping Institute:
First: Keep the skin clean. Wash
the face with soap (one which is


Now Is The Time To Do Something
About Those Skin Blemuishes


germicidal preferred) and water
two or more times a day and rinse
well with warm water, followed by
plenty of cold water. Washing the
face will not only keep the skin
clean but also get rid of some of
the excess fat and lessen the dan¬
ger of spreading infection. Be¬
tween soap-and-water cleansings,
use an antiseptic skin freshener or
tonic to bring relief and check in¬
fection. In the absence of any
of these, a 36 per cent alcohol will
do.
Second: Do not use ordinary
creams on the face until the skin
clears up. At night before going
to bed, you can use a special acne
cream or dab the face with an anti¬
septic lotion to help destroy the
germs.
Wash the hands thoroughly with
water and soap before and after
every skin treatment. Pat on
liquids and cream; never rub them
on.
Keep the hands off the face to
prevent further infection.
When a pimple has come to a
head, pus has formed. Wipe the
surface with alcohol, dip a needle
—never a pin—in alcohol, and prick
the pimple open, carefully taking
up the pus in absorbent cotton
squeezed out in alcohol.
Don’t be too eager to open pim¬
ples. Don’t press a pimple before
it is “ripe," or open it carelessly,
for you may bruise the skin and
leave a scar or spread the infec¬
tion.
The above is merely a relief
measure. It is bound to be tem¬
porary in effect unless the cause is
eliminated.
Although pimples and acne are
caused locally by bacilli and are by
no means diseases of nutrition, nev¬
ertheless correct diet plays an import¬
ant part in their cure. Obviously,
it is important to prevent self-pois¬
oning, to correct indigestion, and to
keep the bowels moving freely. A
diet high in sweets and starches is
conducive to acne. If you have
pimples, go without candy, sweets,


sodas, jams, etc. Don’t eat cereals
or potatoes, fried foods, thickened
soups or gravies. Eat meat spar¬
ingly. Go without stimulants.
Drink ten glasses of water a day
and plenty of fruit juices. Eat
plenty of fresh vegetables and
fruits (except bananas, which are
starchy). Sleep at least eight
hours every night.
There are pimples which have
nothing to do with acne. They may
be caused by digestive disturbances,
nerves being over-tired, or lack of
sleep. Take a good purgative and
when the pimple comes to a head.
open, and press the pus out with the
forefingers wrapped in absorbent
cotton squeezed out in alcohol. Wipe
off with alcohol. If it does not
come to a head, dry it up with ap-
plications of hot water or alcohol.

UR experiences as a child and later on with
half a dozen younger sisters and bro¬
O thers have taught us that one of the
sources of much fun for the children in the
afternoon is playing cooking in the kitchen or
in the yard. Mother would tell us to play cooks
to get us out of the house when Father took
his nap. We used this tactic with our younger
brothers and sisters to get them out of the
way when we wanted to do something.
To make playing at cooking more purpose¬
ful, Mother should provide the children with
materials necessary for cooking and should
teach them to prepare really “eatable” dishes.
Children, however, resent too much meddling in
their play activities; they like to do things in
their own way. Here is when recipes, which
they can follow easily, are useful. Below are
samples of these easy-to-follow recipes.
Fruit Tidbits
1 cup dried fruit (raisins)
12 cup shelled and roasted nuts (pea¬
nuts)
143 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup prunes, stones removed
Mix all ingredients, and pass them through
a food chopper or meat grinder (using the
coarse grinder). If very dry, moisten with a
little lemon or calamansi juice. Mold into a
roll and dust with sugar. Let stand for two
hours, then slice.
This is a very wholesome sweet for chil¬
dren.
Fudge
2 cups granulated sugar
2 squares unsweetened chocolate (or
2 tablespoons cocoa)
142 cup evaporated milk, diluted with
143 cup water
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon vanilla
Mix the sugar and the chocolate (grated,
if the squares are used). Add the diluted
evaporated milk and boil slowly to soft ball

stage. Remove from the fire and add the
vanilla. Cool and beat. Pour into shallow,
square buttered pan or on a buttered deep plate
and allow to harden. Cut into squares while
soft.
A two-tone fudge, which is very attrac-
tive, may be made by pouring a second mix¬
ture, made of the following, over the dark col¬
ored fudge above:
2 cups brown sugar
143 cup evaporated milk
143 cup water
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon vanilla


Mix the sugar and the diluted evaporated
milk in a saucepan and boil slowly to the soft
ball stage. Remove the saucepan from the fire
and add the butter and the vanilla. Cool the
mixture and beat. Pour over the first mix-
ture. When hard, cut into squares.
The recipe for gollorias is ideal for chil¬
dren. In the first place, every one can have
a hand in the making of it; in the second place,
the gollorias can be eaten as soon as cooked.
Gollorias
2 cups flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
A pinch of salt
1 egg
143 cup milk
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
(melted)
Sift ail the dry ingredients in the regular
flour sifter or in a piece of sinamay. Beat the
egg, milk, and melted butter together until they
are well blended. Add enough flour to this
liquid mixture of about 1,3 inch. Cut into
strips about one inch wide. Divide the strips
into small portions, each the size of a marble.
Roll each portion with the thumb over the tines
of a fork until it coils and forms a spiral shell.
Fry in hot fat. Drain and drop into syrup
made by boiling together 1 cup water and 1
cup sugar. Stir the gollorias so that each
piece can be coated with syrup. When the
syrup spins a thread or when a little of it
dropped into cold water forms a soft ball, re¬
move the pan from the fire. Keep on stirring
the gollorias until the sugar becomes dry.
Camote or Banana Fritters
When camotes are used, peel and shred
while raw into a basin of cold water to pre¬
vent discoloration. When bananas are used,
select ripe ones, peel, and cut lengthwise into
thin slices. Drain the camotes very well be¬
fore putting them into the batter.

AINT your house, if it needs
Dpainting, before the advent
 of the rainy season.
It is a wise investment to have
your house painted regularly, or
when it needs painting, for the chief
purpose of paint is to protect the
surfaces it covers against corrosion,
decay, and abrasion, thus making
the house last longer. Then, too,
paint serves as decoration by cov¬
ering the original, unattractive sur¬
face and presenting a new one of
the desired color and finish.
A well-painted house has great¬
er cash value than an unpainted
one. Banks and mortgage com¬
panies always lend more readily
on property that is well-kept.
Some of them even insist that
houses on which they hold mort-
gages be painted regularly be¬
cause they know that paint pro¬
tects their equity and makes a
house easier to sell or to rent.
Every house owner owes some¬
thing to the neighborhood in
which he lives. It is part of his
civic duty to uphold or add to the
tone of his community. Nothing
helps more along this line than a
finely kept-up, well-painted house.
Nothing does more, either, to give
you a feeling of self-respect and
well-being.
Have you looked over your
house lately?
It is easy, especially for the
housewife who stays in the house
most of the time, to get into the
habit of not really seeing the
things one looks at every day.
Sometimes, changes in the condi¬
tion of the house take p’ace so
gradually that, before you realize
it, serious damage has already
been done.
While looking your house over
perhaps you will discover that
paint is falling off, maybe only in
spots, which does not look so
serious and therefore, does not
require immediate attention, you
think. But this condition may be
more dangerous than you realize.
Unless you make a careful inspec¬
tion, rotting may have progressed
so far that replacement is useless
or a waste of money. Parts of the
house which usually suffer rot¬
ting or decay are the window
sil’s, the column bases, and even
the siding. The insidious thing
about rot due to moisture, which
enters the wood through the
breaks in the paint film, is that
it goes on “behind the scenes," so
to speak, and before you know it,


much damage has been done.
After you have made up your
mind to have your house painted,
the next step for you to follow is
to look for a good, dependable
painter, one who really knows his
business. Many a property owner,
in order to economize, hires any
man who knows how to swing a
brush to paint his house. There
is more to painting a house than
merely covering its surfaces with
a substance called paint. It is
important to get a reputable and
experienced painter for the job of
painting your house, for no mat¬
ter how excellent the materials or
the paints that yon will select, if
these are applied by an incompe¬
tent painter, such things as spot¬
"alligorating," wrink'ing,
ting,
running and sagging may result.
Moreover, the paint will not last
as long as it should.
The third step is to insist on
high quality materials, on well¬
known and tried brands of paints
which last for years. What you
pay for a paint does not deter¬
mine how much it costs you.
Years of wear are the determining
factor. Paint which lasts long is
a real economy in the end.
Before having your house paint-
ed, go over it with the painter
and specify the surfaces to be
painted, the number of coats to be
applied, and the brands of paints
to the used. In the case of the last
one, to be sure that they are what
they are supposed to be, they
should be delivered when work be¬
gins, in their original containers,
sealed and with their labels plainly
in evidence. Take the trouble to
check up on this. The reputable
painter will not be offended by
your carefulness, for it is much to
his interest as to yours to have


a anmt POuir TIOuSe
Before The Advent Of
The Rainy Season


this point well verified while the
job is in progress.
Paint will do more to your house
besides protecting it from rotting
and decay, if the right colors are
selected. For instance, if your
house is small, you could make it
look larger than it really is by
using light colors for the body.
Dark colors tend to make a large


house smaller. Dark rooms may
be made brighter with yellow,
white, or light blue paint. Very
well lighted rooms can be toned
down with green or blue paint.
Consult your painter or seek the
advice of the paint dealer when
choosing colors for the different
rooms of the house.

"Lysol”
for feminine hygiene


The importance of using
“Lysol” in feminine hy¬
giene, which is so vital to
every woman, cannot be
over-emphasized. The
method used must be cho¬
sen withgreat care. In many
instances women have in¬
jured themselves seriously,
mainly due to the use of
over-caustic preparations
that irritate the membranes,
or are much too weak to
be dependable as hygienic
agents.


The universal use of "Lysol" in
hospitals where thorough and safe
disinfection is insisted upon is posi¬
tive proof of its safety and efficacy
Surely, then, "Lysol” is correct for
normal feminine hy¬
giene. You can place
tull confidence in


“Lysol” to give your body the me¬
ticulous care it requires. Lysol is sold
at all drug stores—it is never sold in
bulk—insist on the brown bottle in
the yellow carton. It comes in three
convenient sizes, is highly concen¬
trated, therefore more economical
than cheaply priced substitutes.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
On the hour set for the funeral of Harold
Monkhouse, his maurners: his widow, Barha¬
ra; Madeline Norris, a member of the house
hold; his secretary, Wallingford; and Rupert
Mayh 1d, are informed by a police sergeant
that the funeral has heen ordered postpaned
by the coroner who has issued summans to
the members of the Monkhouse household to
he present at the inquest. It is revealed a
the inquest by experts consulted by the Rev
Amos Monkhouse, brother of the dead man,
that the deceased has died of arsenic poison¬
ing and nat from the ailment which had con¬
fined Harold Mankhause to bed as an inva¬
lid. It is revealed that the invalid’s hottle of
medicine contains arsenic and that previous
his death Harald Mankhouse was for a
long time suffering fram arsenic poisoning.
There is strong suspicion from evidence so
far revealed in the inquest that the man has
been paisoned. But how, and by whom?
Chapter V
MADELINE'S ORDEAL
was rather sorry for Dimsdale
His position was a very dis¬
Aagreeable one and he fully real¬
ized it. His patient had been pois¬
oned before his very eyes and he
had never suspected even grave ill¬
ness. In a sense, the death of Har
old Monkhouse lay at his door and
it was pretty certain that every one
present would hold him accountable
for the disaster Indeed, it was
likely that he would receive less
than justice. Those who judged
him would hardly stop to reflect on
the extraordinary difficulties that
beset a busy medical man whose
patient is being secretly poisoned;
would fail to consider the immense
number of cases of illness presented
to him in the course of years of
practice and the infinitely remote
probability that any one of them
is a case of poison. The immense
majority of doctors pass through
the whole of their professional lives
without meeting with such a case;
and it is not surprising that when
the infinitely rare contingency
arises, it nearly always takes the
practitioner unawares. My own
amazement at this incredible hor-
ror tended to make me sympathetic
towards Dimsdale and it was with
some relief that I noted the court-
eous and considerate manner that
the coroner adopted in dealing with
the new witness.
“T think.” the former observed.


“that we had better, in the first
place, pursue our inquiries concern¬
ing the medicine You have heard
the evidence of Dr. Randall and Dr.
Barnes. This bottle of medicine,
before any was taken from it, con¬
tained twelve and a half grains of
arsenious acid, in the form of just
over three fluid ounces of Fowler’s
Solution. Can you suggest any ex¬
planation of that fact?”
“No," replied Dimsdale, “I can¬
not."
"What should the bottle have con¬
tained? What was the composition
of the medicine?”
“The medicine was just a simple,
very mild tonic and alternative. The
bottle contained twenty-four minims
of Tincture of Nux Vomica, sixteen
minims of Liquor Arsenicalis, half
a fluid ounce of Syrup of Bitter
Orange to cover the taste of the
Nux Vomica and half an ounce of
Compound Tincture of Cardamoms.
So that each dose contained three
minims of Tincture of Nux Vomica
and two minims of Liquor Arseni¬


calis."
"Liquor Arsenicalis is another
name for Fowler’s Solution I under¬
stand?
“Yes, it is the official name; the
other is the popular name.
“Who supplied this medicine?
“It was supplied by me.
"Do you usually supply your pa¬
tients with medicine?”
“No. Only a few of my old pa¬
tients who prefer to have their med¬
icine from me. Usually, I write
prescriptions which my patients
have made up by chemists.
“This bottle, then, was made up
in your own dispensary?
“Yes.”
"Now, I put it to you, Dr. Dims¬
dale: this medicine did actually con¬
tain Fowler’s Solution, according to
the prescription. Is it not possible
that some mistake may have oc¬
curred in the amount put into the
bottle?
“No, it is quite impossible.”
"Why is it impossible?”
Because I made up this parti¬


cular bottle myself. As my dispen¬
ser is not a qualified pharmacist, I
always dispense, with my own
hands, any medicines containing
poisons. All dangerous drugs are
kept in a poison cupboard under
lock and key, and I carry the key
on my private bunch. This is the
key, and as you see, the lock is a
Yale lock."
He held up the bunch with the
little flat key separated, for the co¬
roner’s and the jurymen’s inspec¬
tion.
“But,” said the coroner, "you
have not made it clear that a mis¬
take in the quantity was impos
sible.
“I was coming to that," replied
Dimsdale. “The poisons in the
cupboard are, of course, powerful
drugs which are given only in small
doses, and a special measure-glass
is kept in the cupboard to measure
them. This glass holds only two
drachms—a hundred and twenty
minims, that is, a quarter of an
ounce. Now, the analysts found in
this bottle three fluid ounces of
Fowler’s Solution. But to measure
out that quantity, I should have had
to fill the measure-glass twelve
times! That is impossible. No one
could do such a thing as that in¬
advertently, especially when he was
dispensing poisons.
“But that is not all. The poison
bottles are all quite small. The one
in which the Liquor Arsenicalis is
kept is a four ounce bottle It hap¬
pened that I had refilled it a few
days previously and it was full when
I dispensed this medicine. Now,
obviously, if I had put three ounces
of the Liquor into the medicine bot-
tle, ther would have remained in
P
uispenaing bottle only one
Lu the dispensing bottle
i prestieelly full. I had occa¬
mn t use it this morning and I
and it full save for the few mi¬
nims that had been taken to make
up the deceased’s medicine.
"And there is another point. This
medicine was coloured a deepish
pink by the Tincture of Carda¬
moms. But if it had contamed

three ounces of Fowler’s Solution
in addition, it would have been a
deep red of quite a different char¬
acter. But I clearly remember the
appearance of the bottle as it lay
on the white paper when I was
wrapping it up. It had the delicate
pink colour that is imparted by the
cochineal in the Tincture of Carda¬
moms.
The coroner nodded as he wrote
down the reply, and enquired:
“Weuld any of you, gentlemen,
like to ask any questions concern¬
ing the bottle of medicine?
“We should like to know, Sir,"
said the foreman, "whether this
bottle of medicine ever left the doc¬
tor’s hands before it was sent to
deceased?
"No, it did not,” replied Dims¬
dale. “As the dispenser was ab¬
sent, I put up the bottle entirely
myself. I put in the cork, wrote
the label, tied on the paper cap,
wrapped the bottle up, sealed the
wrapping, addressed it and gave it
to the boy to deliver."
The foreman expressed himself
as fully satisfied with this answer
and the coroner then resumed:
“Well, we seem to have disposed
of the medicine so far as you are
concerned, Doctor We will now go
on to consider the condition of de¬
ceased during the last few days.
Did no suspicion of anything abnor¬
mal ever occur to you?
"No, I neither perceived nor sus¬
pected anything abnormal."
Is that not rather remarkable?
I realize that poisoning would be
the last thing that you would be
looking for or expecting. But when
it occurred, is it not a little strange
that you did not recognize the
symptoms?”
“Not at all," replied Dimsdale.
“There was nothing to recognize.
The classical symptoms of arsenic
poisoning were entirely absent.
You will remember that Sir Robert
Detling had no more suspicion
than I had."
“What are the classical symptoms,
as you call them, of arsenic poison¬
ing?”
“T h e recognized symptoms—
which are present in the immense
majority of cases—are acute abdo¬
minal pain and tenderness, in¬
tense thirst, nausea, vomiting
and purging; the symptoms, in
fact, of extreme irritation of the
stomach and intestines But in the
case of deceased, these symptoms
were entirely absent. There was,
in my opinion, nothing whatever in
his appearance or symptoms to sug¬
gest arsenic poisoning. His condi¬
tion appeared in no way different
from what I had known it to be on
several previous occasions; just a
variation for the worse of his or¬
dinary ill-health.
“You do not doubt that arsenic
poisoning was really the cause of
his death?
“The analysis seems to put the
matter beyond question: otherwise
—I mean apart from the analysis
—I would not have entertained the
idea of arsenic poisoning for a mo¬
ment."


“But you do not dispute the cause
of death?'
“No Arsenic is extraordinarily
variable in its effects, as Dr. Ran¬
dall mentioned, both on the dead
body and on the living. Very an¬
omalous cases of arsenic poisoning
have been mistaken, during life, for
opium poisoning.
The coroner wrote down the an¬
swer and having glanced over his
notes, asked:
"What was the condition of de-
ceased when his wife went away
from home?
He was much better. In fact
his health seemed to be improving
so much that I hoped he would soon
be about again."
"And how soon after his wife’s
departure did his last attack be¬
gin?"
“I should hardly call it an at¬
tack. It was a gradual change for
the worse. Mrs. Monkhouse went
away on the 29th of August. On
the 2nd of September deceased was
not so well and was extremely de¬
pressed and disappointed at the re¬
lapse. From that time his condi¬
tion fluctuated, sometimes a little
better and sometimes not so well.
On the 8th he appeared rather ser¬
iously ill and was no better on the
9th, the day of the consultation
with Sir Robert Detling. After
that he seemed to improve a little,
and the slight improvement was
maintained up to the 12th. His
death came, at least to me, as quite
a surprise.


“You spoke just now of several
previous occasions on which attacks
—or, if you prefer it, relapses—of
a similar kind occurred. Looking
back on those relapses by the light
of what we now know do you say
that they were quite similar, in res¬
pect of the symptoms, to the one
which ended in the death of de¬
ceased?”
“I should say they were identic-
ally similar. At any rate, I can. re¬
call no difference.
"Did any of them seem to be as
severe as the fatal one?'
“Yes; in fact the last of them-
which occurred in June—seemed to
be more severe, only that it was
followed by improvement and re¬
covery. I have here the section of
my card-index which relates to de¬
ceased. In the entry dated June
19th you will see that I have noted
the patient’s unsatisfactory condi¬
tion."
He handed a small pack of index¬
cards to the coroner, who examined
the upper card intently and then
with a sudden raising of the eye¬
brows, addressed the jury
I had better read out the en¬
try The card is headed 'Harold
Monkhouse’ and this entry reads:
June 19th. Patient very low and
feeble. No appetite. Considerable
gastric discomfort and troublesome
cough. Pulse 90, small, thready.
Heart sounds weak. Sending re¬
port to Mrs. Monkhouse.”"
He laid the cards down on the
table, and, looking fixedly at Dims¬


dale, repeated: " ‘Sending report
to Mrs. Monkhouse!' Where was
Mrs. Monkhouse?”
“Somewhere in Kent, I believe. I
sent the report to the head-quar¬
ters of the Women’s Freedom
League in Knightrider Street,
Maidstone, from whence I supposed
it would be forwarded to her."
For some seconds after receiving
this answer the coroner continued
to gaze steadily at the witness. At
length he observed:
“This is a remarkable coincid¬
ence. Can you recall the condition
of deceased when Mrs. Monkhouse
went away on that occasion?”
‘Yes. I remember that he was
in comparatively good health. In
fact, his improved condition fur¬
nished the opportunity for Mrs.
Monkhouse to make her visit to
Maidstone.
Can you tell us how soon after
her departure on that occasion the
relapse occurred?”
“I cannot say definitely, but my
impression is that the change for
the worse began a few days after
she went away Perhaps I might
be able to judge by looking at my
notes."
The coroner handed him back
the index-cards, which he looked
through rapidly “Yes,” he said,
at length, “here is an entry on
June 11th of a bottle of tonic med¬
icine for Mrs. Monkhouse. So
she must have been at home on that
date; and as it was a double-sized
bottle, it was probably for her to
take away with her."
“Then," said the coroner, "it is
clear that, on the last two occasions,
the deceased was comparatively
well when his wife left home, but
had a serious relapse soon after she
went away. Now, what of the pre¬
vious relapses?”
“I am afraid I cannot remember.
I have an impression that Mrs.
Monkhouse was away from home
when some of them occurred, but at
this distance of time, I cannot re¬
collect clearly. Possibly Mrs. Monk¬
house, herself, may be able to re¬
member."
“Possibly,” the coroner agreed,
rather drily, "but as the point is of
considerable importance, I should
be glad if you would presently look
through your case cards and see if
you can glean any definite infor¬
mation on the subject. Meanwhile
we may pass on to one or two other
matters. First as to the medicine
which you prescribed for deceased;
it contained, as you have told us,
a certain amount of Fowler’s Solu¬
tion, and you considered deceased
to be suffering from chronic gas¬
tritis. Is Fowler’s Solution usually
given in cases of gastritis?"
“No. It is usually considered
rather unsuitable. But deceased
was very tolerant of small doses of
arsenic. I had often given it to
him before as a tonic and it had
always seemed to agree with him.
The dose was extremely small—only
two minims.

ceased?”
“I have known, and attended him
professionally about twenty years."
"From your knowledge of him,
should you say that he was a man
who was likely to make enemies?
"Not at all. He was a kindly,
just and generous man, amiable
and even-tempered; rather re¬
served and aloof; not very human,
perhaps, and somewhat self-con¬
tained and solitary. But I could
not imagine him making an enemy
and, so far as I know, he never
did."
The coroner reflected awhile after


writing down this answer and then
turned to the jury.
“Are there any questions that you
wish to put to the witness, gentle¬
men?"
The jury consulted together for
a few moments, and the foreman
then replied:
“We should like to know, Sir, if
possible, whether Mrs. Monkhouse
was or was not away from home
when the previous relapses oc¬
curred.
“I am afraid," said Dimsdale,
“that I cannot be more explicit as
the events occurred so long ago.
The other witnesses—the members
of the household—would be much
more likely to remember. And
would urge you not to detain me
from my professional duties longer
than is absolutely necessary."
Hereupon a brief consultation
took place between the coroner and
the jury, with the result that Dims¬
dale was allowed to go about his
business and Barbara was sum-
moned to take his place. I had
awaited this stage of the proceed¬
ings with some uneasiness and was
now rather surprised and greatly
relieved at the coroner’s manner to¬
wards her; which was courteous
and even sympathetic. Having ex¬
pressed his and the jury’s regret
at having to trouble her in the very
distressing circumstances, he pro¬
ceeded at once to clear off the pre¬
liminaries, eliciting the facts that
she was 32 years of age and had
been married a little over three

years, and then said:
“Dr. Dimsdale has told us that
on the occasion of the attack or
relapse in June last you were away
from home, but he is not certain
about the previous ones. Can you
give us any information on the sub¬
ject?"
“Yes,” she replied, in a quiet,
steady voice, “I recall quite clearly
at least three previous occasions on
which I went away from home leav¬
ing my husband apparently well—
as well as he ever was—and came
back to find him quite ill. But I
think there were more than three
occasions on which this happened,
for I remember having once accused
him, facetiously, of saving up his
illnesses until I was out of the
house.
“Can you remember if a serious
relapse ever occurred when you
were at home?”
“Not a really serious one. My
husband’s health was always very
unstable and he often had to rest
in bed for a day or two. But the
really bad attacks of illness seem
always to have occurred when I was
away from home."
"Did it never strike you that this
was a very remarkable fact?”
“I am afraid I did not give the
matter as much consideration as I
ought to have done. Deceased was
always ailing, more or less, and
those about him came to accept his
ill-health as his normal condition."
“But you see the significance of
it now?”
Barbara hesitated and then re¬
plied in a low voice and with evid-
ent agitation:
“I see that it may have some sig-
nificance, but I don’t in the least
understand it. I am quite over¬
whelmed and bewildered by the
dreadful thing that has happened.
“Naturally, you are,” the coroner
said in a sympathetic tone, "and I
am most reluctant to trouble you
with questions under circumstances
that must be so terrible to you. But
we must find out the truth if we
can."
“Yes, I realize that,” she replied,
"and thank you for your conside¬
ration."
The coroner bowed, and after a
brief pause, asked: "Did it never
occur to you to engage a nurse to
attend to deceased?"
“Yes. I suggested it more than
once to deceased, but he wouldn’t
hear of it. And I think he was
right. There was nothing that a
nurse could have done for him. He
was not helpless and he was not
continuously bed-ridden. He had a
bell-push by his bedside and his sec¬
retary or the servants were always


ready to do anything that he wanted
done. The housemaid was most at¬
tentive to him. But he did not
want much attention. He kept the
books that he was reading on his
bedside table and he liked to be left
alone to read in peace. He felt
that the presence of a nurse would
have been disturbing."
"And at night?”
“At night his bell-push was con¬
nected with a bell in the secretary’s
bedroom. But he hardly ever used
it. If his candle-lamp burned out
he could put in a fresh candle from
the box on his table; and he never
seemed to want anything else.”
“Besides deceased and yourself,
who were the inmates of the
house?”
“There was my husband’s secret-
ary, Mr. Wallingford, Miss Norris,
the cook, Anne Baker, the house¬
maid, Mabel Withers, and the kit-
chenmaid, Doris Brown."
"Why did deceased need a secret¬
ary? Did he transact much busi¬
ness?'
“No. The secretary wrote his
few business letters, kept the ac-
counts and executed any commis¬
sions, besides doing the various
things that the master of the house
would ordinarily have done. He is
the son of an old friend of my hus¬
band’s and he came to us when his
father died."
And Miss Norris? What was
her position in the household?”
‘She lived with us as a guest at
my husband’s invitation. She was
the daughter of his first wife’s sis-
ter, and he, more or less informally,
adopted her as he had no children
of his own.”
"Deceased was a widower, then,
when you married him?”
“Yes. His wife had been dead
about two years."
"What was his age when he
died?”
“He had just turned fifty-seven."
“On what sort of terms was de¬
ceased with the members of his
household?”
“On the best of terms with them
all. He was an undemonstrative
man and rather cool and reserved
with strangers and distinctly solit¬
ary and self-contained. But he was
a kind and generous man and all
the household, including the serv¬
ants, were devoted to him."
“Was deceased engaged in any
business or profession?"
“No, he had independent means,
inherited from his father.
“Would you describe him as a
wealthy man?
“I believe he was quite well off,
but he never spoke of his financial
affairs to me, or to anybody but
his lawyers.”

"Do you know how his property
is disposed of?"
“I know that he made a will, but
I never enquired about the terms
of it and he never told me."
“But surely you were an inte¬
rested party."
“It was understood that some pro¬
vision would be made for me if I
survived him. That was all that
concerned me. Deceased was not
a man with whom it was necessary
to make conditions; and I have
some small property of my own. Mr.
Mayfield, who is present, of course,
knows what the provisions of the
will are as he is one of the exe¬
cutors.”
Once more the coroner paused to
look over his notes. Then he
glanced inquiringly at the jury,
and, when the foreman shook his
head, he thanked Barbara and dis¬
missed her; and as she walked back
to her chair, pale and grave but per¬
fectly composed, I found myself ad¬
miring her calm dignity and only
hoping that the other witnesses
would make as good a figure. But
this hope was no sooner conceived
than it was shattered. The next
name that was called was Madeline
Norris and for a few moments
there was no response. At length
Madeime rose slowly, ashen and
ghastly of face, and walked unstead¬
ily to the table. Her appearance¬
her deathly pallor and her trembling
hands—struck me with dismay;
and what increased my concern for


sympathy; but not a sign of sym-
pathy was discernible in their faces
—nothing but a stony curiosity.
Having been sworn—on a testa¬
ment which shook visibly in her
grasp—she deposed that her name
was Madeline Norris and her age
twenty-seven.
"Any occupation?” the coroner
enquired drily without looking up.
“I am a teacher at the Westmin¬
ster College of Domestic Science.
“Teacher of what?”
"Principally of cookery and kit¬
chen management, especially in¬
valid cookery."
“Are you, yourself, a skilled
cook?
“Yes. It is my duty to demon¬
strate to the class."
Have- you ever cooked or pre¬
pared food for the deceased?
“Yes. I usually cooked his meals
when I was in the house at meal
times.
“It has been stated that you pre¬
pared the last meal that deceased
took. Is that correct?”
“Yes. I cooked an omelette for
his supper."
"Will you describe to us the way
in which you prepared that
omelette?
Madeline considered for a few
moments and then replied in a low
shaky voice: “It was just a simple
omelette. I first rubbed the pan
with a cut clove of garlic and put
in the butter to heat. Then I broke
an egg into a cup, separated the
yolk from the white, and, having
beaten them up separately, mixed

hot plate which I covered at once.
“Who took it up to deceased?”
"I did. I ran straight up with
it and sat and talked to deceased
while he ate it."
"Did you meet any one on youl
way up or in the bedroom?"
“No There was nobody on the
stairs, and the deceased was alone.
"Did deceased take anything to
drink with his supper?”
“Yes. He had a glass of chablis.
I fetched the bottle and the glass
from the dining room and poured
out the wine for him.
"Did you meet anybody in the
dining room or coming or going?”
"No, I met nobody.
“Can you think of any way in
which any poison could have got
into the omelette or into the wine?'
"No. Nothing could possibly have
got into the omelette. As to the
wine, I poured it from the bottle
into a clean glass. But the bottle
was already open and had been in
the cellaret since lunch."
“Now, with regard to the med¬
icine. Did you give deceased any
on the day before his death?”
“Yes. I gave him a dose soon
after I came in—about six o’clock.
That was the last dose in the bot
tle."
"Did you notice anything un¬
usual about the medicine?”
“No. It was similar to what he
had been taking for some days
past.
"What was the medicine like?”
“It was nearly colourless with the
faintest tinge of red and smelled

one? What is the best method of
taking care of the ducklings to pre¬

worse diseases of Philippine ducks?
-Cesar A. Reyes, Sigma, Capiz.
ANSWERS:—(1) Young ducks
have smooth scales on the shanks
and toes while old ducks have
coarse rough scales. Young ducks
molt fast and usually lay more
heavily than the old ones. (2)
Feed them properly in groups of
fifty to avoid trampling. In feed¬
ing be guided by our Bulletin on
"Duck Raising. If you do not
have a copy send P0.14 in postage
stamps and you will be furnished

tacked by diseases. Most of their
ai'ments are due to wrong feeding
and unhygienic surroundings. Pro¬

slightly of lavender and bitter or¬
ange."
“Was there anything that caused
you to notice particularly, on this
occasion, the appearance and smell
of the medicine?"
“No. I noticed the colour and
the smell when I opened the bottle
on the previous morning to give de¬
ceased a dose.
"Did you examine the new bottle
which had just been sent?”
“Yes. I looked at it and took out
the cork and smelled it and tasted
it.
“What made you do that?”
“I noticed that it seemed to con¬
tain Tincture of Cardamoms and I
smelled and tasted it to find out if
the other ingredients had been
changed."
"And what conclusion did you
arrive at?'
“That they had not been changed.
I could taste the Nux Vomica and
smell the orange and the Liquor
Arsenicalis—at least the lavender."
"Did you realize what the lav-
ender smell was due to?"
“Yes. I recognized it as the smell
of Liquor Arsenicalis. I know that
deceased was taking Liquor Arse¬
nicalis because I had asked Dr.
Dimsdale about it when I first no¬
ticed the smell."
The coroner wrote down this an¬
swer and then, raising his head,
looked steadily at Madeline for
some seconds without speaking;
and the jury, looked harder still.

NHE making of serapbooks has
come to be an important
I device in teaching, wnien is
yielding many practical results.
Not all teachers, however, seem to
see the objectives for the making
of scrapbooks and it is often re¬
sorted to as an inconsequential
project, yielding no definite re¬
sult nor any lasting pleasure.
Many objectives may be suggested,
but I will give on'y four as being
the most important.
First, the scrapbook encourages
outside reading. The pupils under
pressure of finding enough and va¬
ried materials for their scrapbooks
must go over a variety of sources.
Second, it trains in the selection
and discrimination of materials and
in the evaluation of ideas. This
should demand the coaching of pu¬
pils by the teacher. The teacher
should write now and then on the
board a list of items in connection
with a given lesson that may be in¬
cluded in the scrapbook together
with the sources where the mate¬
rials may possibly be found. Third,
it humanizes learning and makes
the results more permanent. The
scrapbook should illustrate isolated
cases of life or situations that would
bring the content of the lesson
closely to the hearts of the pupils.
The fact that the pupils look for
these cases under special stimula¬
tion makes the pupils think more
about them and put special value
upon their work. Indeed, while the
scrapbook represents isolate situa¬
tions of life, it is in reality a syn¬
thetic picture of a specific expe¬
rience. Fourth, the scrapbook pro¬

that the world knows there exist
Dr. Becker’s pills, for diseases of
the kidneys and bladder that an¬
nually cause countless deaths. The
fame of Dr. Becker’s pills increases
every day, in the treatment of hot

nate day and night, back and waist

vides noble and interesting employ¬
ment of leisure. This is much more
so when it is subordinated with
other hobbies like stamp collecting
and gathering curios of art. The
much more simplified schemes in
which school work is being done
leaves more time for leisure and
play. The children find greater op-
portunity to relish in things and ac-
tivities outside their ordinary rou¬
tine in school and the appropriation
of their extra time in useful enjoy-
ment actually becomes a problem.
As a method, the scrapbook should
be used under proper guidance in
a circumstance where there are
enough sources and materials to jus¬
tify its imposition. Where the ma¬
terials in the libraries or elsewhere
are woefully wanting, the teacher
resorts to letting the pupils draw
illustrations in their scrapbooks.
Not all pupils, to be sure, are good
drawers, so the illustrations usual¬
ly prove unsatisfactory or hardly
artistic, if they prove anything at
all. The practice can only result in
disappointment for both the pupils
and the teacher, and the encourage¬
ment of habits of slovenliness and
impatience in fishing out ade¬
quate materials. To make pupils
attempt to do what they cannot pos¬
sibly do under the circumstances,
however good, generally results in
discouragement, and defeats the pur¬
pose of any educational method.
On the other hand, one way of in-
stilling hope in the pupils and put¬
ting the morale of the whole class
on a sound basis is to make them
see the truth of their own abilities
and feel that they can do something
within their own initiative and po¬
wer.


THE POISON
Continued from page 9


Not A New Plant Here
Derris has been growing here in
wild state for centuries perhaps,
You probably have come across this
plant on banks of creeks, rivers, and
lakes; at the border of fields, on
hillsides, or in forests without
knowing it.
There are some sixteen identified
species of Derris growing in the
Islands, according to Assistant
Agronomist Juan M. Ejercito of
the bureau of plant industry, who
has made quite an extensive study
of the plant. According to him, the
majority of these are tall woody
—vines ahich climb trees.


Each of these species is some-
times known by several names even
in the same dialect. It is curious,
however, that several of these spe¬
cies are known by the same local
name. As a group, these species
are known most commonly as tuble,
tubli, and other similar-sounding
terms.
Local Names
Among the Tagalogs, Derris is
known by the following names:
malacagios, malacadios, tuble, tubli,
tugli, tuglin, tablong, tuba, tugling
pula, tibanglan, malasiag, malasaga,
tibalao, bagarilao, asin-asina, manga¬
sin, asiasimanan, dugo-rogo, rugo¬
rogo, oliabak na puti, gogoan, in¬
guing, tinalang, tuglos, sila-sila.
The Visayans know these species
as sila-sila, babugtus, malungpa¬
cong, tuble, hingasin, hingasinan,
balitos, baloc-baloc, butong; those
in the Bicol region call them tuble,
lapak; Ilocanos refer to them as
boot, balaylamoc, marakatudai, tu¬
ba; Pampangos know them as ala¬
bagat, malagongdapo, malasiag, ti¬
banglan; Manobos call them, bogo¬
don, bagodominahon, tubili, tuble,
sabuko.
Besides these, Derris plants are
also known as putat-gadang (Ifu¬
gao), upei, kabubut (Bontoc), and
tubuluan, banlancag (Subano).
For generations our ancestors
used the raw roots of this plant in
poisoning fishes inhabiting brooks,
rivers, and even lakes. All that
they did—many still do it, laws to
the contrary notwithstanding—was
to pound the roots of newly-pulled
Derris plants into, pulp and press


the juice into the water. A few
hours later, the poisoned fish would
be found floating in the water,
ready to be picked up by fishermen.
So strong is the poison that even
relatively big bodies of water can
be made toxic to fishes by its use.
And yet such poisoned fishes are
absolutely safe to eat.
An Efficiont Insecticide
Our people have found no other
use for this plant than for poison¬
ing fish. Even scientists have only
recently discovered its excellent pro¬
perties as an insecticide. Of course
there are many commercial insecti¬
cides which are very effective, but
Derris is unique in that it is non¬
poisonous to human beings and
lower animals.
Powdered Derris roots dusted on
animals have been found very effi¬
cient against dog fleas, chicken lice,
cattle ticks. It is equally effective
against bedbugs, house flies, white
ants, some species of aphids, and
certain other vegetable pests.
When a solution of Derris is used
as spray, it kills the larvae and
adults of leaf beetles, larvae of saw¬
flies, plant lice, etc. Even the
youngest leaves and seedlings and
roots of plants are not harmed by
its application.
Can Be Easily Raised Here
Derris is not a very fastidious
plant, judging from its wide distri¬
bution in the Islands. If it can
grow almost everywhere in a wild
state, even in barren soil, it is ob¬

bespectacled, near-obese. But she
remembered her grades....) she
stood up smiling.
She danced with him mechani¬
cally, and this was her thought:
Where is Fredo? It seemed to her
that the piece was too long—and
would never end. She even thought


of not speaking to him that eve¬
ning.
At last the piece ended and she
was on her seat again. Turning
toward the doorway she saw Fredo.
Her eyes did not say, “You are late,
why?" but "I am waiting for you.”

NITTING in a corner of the
well-lighted dance hall was
O Jose, a look of restlessness in
his face. His eyes were on the ma¬
ny dancing couples on the dance
floor. He hated to think that the
initial piece of the ball—a fox-trot
—was being played.
That morning he had asked Ne¬
na to dance the first piece with him.
He remembered the curling of her
lips as she said “Oh, yes.” But
there he was now—sitting alone¬
and the first piece was being play¬
ed. How he cursed the orchestra
for playing that fox-trot: he hated
all fox-trots. “God,” he said to him¬
self, "will this piece not end?”
Then he looked at the dancing
pairs envyingly and when he found
Nena in the arms of his rival, he
felt a cold shiver through his body.
Consolingly, he rolled his eyes on
her beautiful green satin gown,
then at her back (she was lovely at
the back), and then on the rose in
her hair....
A classmate approached him and
said:
“Jose, some nights are like this
—my first dance spoiled."


“Yes,” Jose returned. "And I
hope the next piece is a waltz.”
“So you are going to dance now?”
his classmate asked again.
Jose spoke coldly: “Yes, for the
first time."
II
Rita knew that her sweetheart,
Fredo, was going to ask her for the
first dance. She had wished that
the first piece of the graduation
ball would be a fox-trot: she loved
fox-trots very much, and especially
when Fredo was her partner, she
could glide more gracefully.
And the first piece played was a
fox-trot.... She was glad. But
where was Fredo? Already there
were couples on the dance floor,
whirling to the quick-timed fox¬
trot. But with Fredo still not come,
she was disappointed. She wished
she were home, "A blue night,” she
thought.
The fox-trot ended after a while
and a clapping of hands followed.
When the opening chords of the
same piece were being played, her
mathematics instructor asked her
to dance. Reluctantly (she did not
like to dance with him: a bachelor.

so many meanings and interpreta¬

A girl begs for her mother’s con¬

most pleasantly, “May I go to the
dance, Mother dear, ha? (Of course
she has the foresight to see that
her parent is in her best mood.)
And then to strengthen her plea,
adds, "May I, ha? Ha? Ha?” each
ha being punctuated by some little
caress, some affectionate pinches
and pats. Thus ha wins the day

QUESTIONS:—My face has been
getting more oily each day for al¬
most a week now. I cannot say it
is due to lack of personal cleanliness
for I am always taking a bath
morning and afternoon. But only
two or three hours pass after I have
taken a bath and my face is oily
again. What makes my face oily?
Is this a kind of disease?—An In¬
quirer, Manila.
ANSWERS:—Fat is needed by
the skin in order to prevent crack¬
ing. Fat individuals have a more
or less excessively shiny face. It
is therefore advisable that you
consult a physician.—Answered
by Dr. Jose P. Bantug, chief,
health & publicity section, bureau
of health, Manila.

pecially in the morning when I got
up early, I felt a slight pain below
my heart. As I could not ascertain
its real cause, I just took up breath¬
ing exercise, hands-on-hips exercise,
and bending exercise. But it only
gave me a little relief. What is the
cause of my chest pain? Is this a
symptom of tuberculosis?—A. B. L.
Espiritu, Malabon, Rizal.
ANSWERS:—It is difficult for
me to determine what your ailment
is. Your chest pain may come
from disease of the heart, lungs or
just from your nerves. It is there¬
fore advisable that you consult a
physician—Answered by Dr. Jose

first, ha? And be sure not to dry
it in the sunshine, ha?
A father also employs it to en¬
force authority, to give his words
more weight. “Bear this in mind,
ha, you are not to meet that young
rascal again. Remember this, ha?
The young lover also finds this lit-
tle word useful in his proposals and
amorous conquests. “You love me,


Toring, don’t you? And you will
marry me, ha ?” the ha being
breathed ever so softly and sweet¬
ly.
Then of course there are the deaf,
who are literally the professional
“ha-ers.” When they don’t hear
what one has just said, they say
"Ha?” in place of "will you please
repeat,” or “I beg your pardon,
please say it again."
And for merriment, we use the
same serviceable little word again.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!


AS A THIEF.

At length the former spoke, slowly,
deliberately, emphatically.
“You have told us that you ex¬
amined this medicine to find out
what it contained, and that you
were able to recognize Tincture of
Cardamoms by its colour and
Liquor Arsenicalis by its smell. It
would seem, then, that you know a
good deal about drugs. Is that
so?”
"I know something about drugs.
My father was a doctor and he
taught me simple dispensing so
that I could help him."
The coroner nodded. "Was there
any reason why you should have
taken so much interest in the com¬
position of deceased’s medicine?”
Madeline did not answer imme¬
diately. And as she stood trem¬
bling and hesitating in evident con¬
fusion, the coroner gazed at her
stonily, and the jury craned for¬
ward to catch her reply.


“I used to examine his medicine,"
she replied at length, in a low voice
and a reluctant and confused man¬
ner. "because I know that it often
contained Liquor Arsenicalis and I
used to wonder whether that was
good for him. I understood from
my father that it was a rather irri¬
tating drug, and it did not seem
very suitable for a patient who suf-
fered from gastritis."
There was a pause after she had
spoken and something in the ap-
pearance of the inquisitors almost as
if they had been a little disap-
pointed by this eminently reason¬
able answer. At length the coroner
broke the silence by asking, with a
slight softening of manner:
“You have said that the change
in colour of the last medicine led
you to taste and smell it to ascer¬
tain if the other ingredients had
been changed. You have said that
you decided that they had not been
changed. Are you sure of that?
Can you swear that the smell of
lavender was not stronger in this
bottle than in the previous ones?
“It did not seem to me to be
stronger.”
“Supposing the bottle had then
contained as much Liquor Arseni¬
calis as was found in it by the
analysts, would you have been able
to detect it by the smell or other-
wise?”
“Yes, I feel sure that I should.
The analysts found three ounces of
Liquor Arsenicalis; that would be
nearly half the bottle. I am sure
I should have detected that amount,
not only by the strong smell but by

The Philippine Deep is part of a
five-hundred-mile stretch of deep
waler extending from the northern
coast of Samar to the south-eastern end
of Mindanao. It was discovered in 1912
by the German surveying ship, Planet,
at approximately lat. 9? 55’ N, long.
126" 55' E, recording a depth of 32,112
feet. In 1927, at approximately lat. 99
40 N, long. 1266 50' E., about 15 miles
south of the Planet discovery, the Ger¬
man cruiser, Emden, obtained a sound¬
ing of 34,218 feet, which exceeds that of
any other ocean depth in the world.
Japan’s Tuscarora Deep, with a
depth of at least 32,664 feet, runs se¬
cond to the Philippine Deep. The At¬
lantic’s Nares Deep has a depth of 27,-
972 feet, the Indian Ocean’s Wharton
Deep, 22,968 feet; the Arctic’s greatest,
13,120 feet; and the Antarctic’s deep-
est, 13,932 feet.
These wonderful ocean depths are of
great scientific interest and perhaps
also of local pride, but are, neverthe¬
less, looked upon as sources of immense
danger. There is a theory that they
have some connection with earth tre-
mors. This theory is supported in the
Philippines by the fact that the eastern
part of Mindanao, together with Sa¬
mar and Leyte, suffers from earth¬
quakes more than any other region in
the Philippines.

The World’s Greatest
Ocean Depth


EHE earth is deeper than high!
The world’s greatest land eleva¬
 tion, Mt. Everest in the H.ma¬
layas, if placed in the world’s greatest
ocean depth, would have its peak a
mile below the surface of the ocean!
If the famous Philippine mountains,
Apo (the Isiands’ highest), Mayon,
Banajao, Mariveles, Makiling, and
Taal were placed on top of one another
and sunk into this deep, the sunnit
of this pile of mountains would still
be more than fifty feet under water.
To reach its bottom from the ocean
surface, more than six thousand three
hundred persons, each five feet and
five inches high (more than the ave
rage Filipino’s height), will have to
stand on eacli other's head!
Among the denizens of this wonder¬
ful place are some of the strangest
fishes in the world.
This great ocean deep is the famous
Mindanao Deep, also called the Philip-
pine Deep, which has the greatest
known depth in the world. It is lo¬
cated about forty-five miles eastward
from Surigao Island off the north end
of Mindanao, and its bottom is 34,218
feet, or 101% kilometers, from the sur¬
face of the Pacific Ocean.


the colour, too.”
“You are sure that the colour of
this medicine was due to Carda¬
moms only?"
‘Yes, that is to cochineal. I re-


cognized it at once. It is perfectly
unmistakable and quite different
from the colour of Red Sandalwood,
with which Liquor Arsenicalis is
coloured. Besides, this medicine


was only a deepish pink in colour.
But if three ounces of Liquor Arse¬
nicalis had been in the bottle, the
medicine would have been quite a
dark red."
“You have some experience in dis¬
pensing. Do you consider it pos¬
sible that the Liquor Arsenicalis
could have been put into the med¬
icine by mistake when it was being
made up?”
“It would be quite impossible if
a minim measure-glass was used,
as the glass would have had to be
filled twelve times. But this is
never done. One does not measure
large quantities in small measures.
Three ounces would be measured
out in a four or five ounce mea¬

two ounce measure, by half refill¬
ing it."
“Might not the wrong measure¬
glass have been taken up by mis¬
take?"
“That is, of course, just possible.
But it is most unlikely; for the
great disproportion between the
large measure-glass and the little
stock-bottle would be so striking
that it could hardly fail to be no¬
ticed."
‘Then, from your own observa¬
tion and from Dr. Dimsdale’s evid¬
ence, you reject the idea that a mis¬
take may have been made in dis¬
pensing this bottle of medicine?”
“Yes, entirely. I have heard Dr.
Dimsdale’s evidence and I exam¬
ined the medicine. I am convinced
that he eculd not have made a mis¬
take under the circumstances that
he described and I am certain that
the medicine that I saw did not con¬
tein more than a small quantity-
less than a drachm—of Liquor
Prsenicalis."
“You are not forgetting that the
analysts actually found the equiva¬
lent of three ounces of Liquor Arse¬
nicalis in the bottle?”
“No. But I am sure it was not
there when I examined the bottle."
The coroner wrote down this an¬
swer with a deliberate air, and,
when he had finished, turned to the
jury.
“I think we have nothing more
to ask this witness, unless there is
any point that you want made more
clear."
There was a brief silence. Then
the super-intelligent juryman inter¬
posed.

vious that it can be very much im¬
proved by scientific cultivation.
According to Agronomist Juan M.
Ejercito, the plant can be propa¬
gated by cuttings. They root very
easily, the average being about a
month from the time of planting.
Two years later, they can be har¬
vested.
The cuttings are planted one me¬
ter from each other in ridges about
a meter apart. This gives 10,000
plants to the hectare. The average
yield, according to computations
made at the bureau of plant indus¬
try, is about l8 kilo of fresh roots
per plant. Placing the loss of
weight from drying at 40%, and
giving an allowance of 36% for dead
plants, a hectare planted to 10,000
will yield 2,900 kilos of dry roots.
Now, if we conservatively place
the price of dried roots at P0.50 a
kilo (it is actually about twice as
much as that) a hectare should give
its owner at least P1,450. That is
some money for a hectare, in any
language.
Selection of Plants
It must be taken into conside¬
ration, however, that not all species
of Derris plants command high
prices. The determining factor of
the value of these plants is the pro¬
portion of the poison it contains
per unit weight. This poison is
known as rotenone and is measured
by chemical analysis.
Derris plants which contain 596


of rotenone (computed from the
weight of the dried root powder)
is considered excellent. Commer¬
cial firms purchase Derris root pow¬
der which contains as low as 3%
of rotenone.
According to analyses made by
the bureau of science and the bu¬
reau of plant industry, different
species of Derris here have been
found to yield all the way from 796
of rotenone to nil. Proper selec¬
tion of plants and the improvement
of the varieties will assure local pro¬
ducers of good markets and plenty
of cash.


BOHOL TEACHERS
Continued from page 13


The following day, April 16th, the
camp was formally started. Pro¬
vincial Governor Garcia made a
speech on the importance of Na¬
tional defense, figuratively slapped
in the face the skeptics who think
that nothing we can do will be suf-
ficient to defend the Philippines.
High School Principal Agustin Pa¬
nares, representing the division
superintendent of schools, spoke on
the importance of attention especial¬
ly in the classrooms.
The cadre of officer-instructors
and enlisted men in charge of the
camp at Tagbilaran are Capt. Do¬
nato Halili, U.S.A. (reserve)—com-
mandant-instructor; Lt. Matias
Lingsangan, P.A.—adjutant sup¬
ply-disbursing officer-instructor;
Corp. Justino Hora—mess sergeant;


 OU often hear about mighty
little men who perform pro¬
 digious feats of strength
that may well tax bigger and
brawnier men. You may have read
about “Little Bill” Johnston, the
"mighty atom of the courts” or
about Mickey Walker dubbed the
“toy bulldog of the heavies." And
you may like to recall how the Phil¬
ippines used to lord it over Japan
and China in the Far Eastern
Olympics. In every branch of
sports there are always little
giants who fight against over¬
whelming odds and in spite of
great physical handicaps make
good. In women’s volleyball there
is Magsingal Institute, a mighty
mite among schools, if there ever
was one.
Maybe I am wrong. At any rate,
here are the facts: The Magsingal
Institute is a struggling private
high school in Magsingal, Ilocos
Sur, with an enrollment of about
one hundred. In ten years of trying
to make both ends meet, its yearly
enrollment has not gone far be¬
yond the hundred mark. For the
past three years it has been teach-
ing Manila universities and colleges
how girls, not to say co-eds, should
play volleyball. In those three
years it has knocked persistently
at the door of the national cham¬
pionship in women’s volleyball,


Conrado Panares—clerk-orderly.
The tentative assignments of
teacher-trainees are as follows:
Company commander—Vicente Ma¬
nalo, acting captain; second in com¬
mand—Pedro Caunan, acting first
lieutenant; platoon leaders—R. Vi¬
llamor (first platoon), C. M. Abar¬
quez (second platoon), G. Arbilo
(third platoon); first sergeant—J.
Racho (acting); platoon sergeants
—S. Virador, S. Abrenilla, and F.
Lagahit.


each time losing out in the finals
to the strong M. I. A. A. combina¬
tion by the closest of scores. Last
February it walked away with the
gonfalon by handing the Philippine
Women’s University, the Philippine
Normal School, and the Far East¬
ern University, the best that Manila
could put up against it, a drubbing
they are not likely to forget easily.
Small as it is, the Magsingal In¬
stitute has always been a name to
reckon with in local athletics. A
time there was when its baseball
team journeyed up and down the
Ilocos coast without a defeat. Since
1932, the year it captured the Ilo¬
cano championship in girls’ volley¬
ball, its supremacy in that branch
of sports has never been challenged
here. It has lost to only one team
during four years of active cam¬
paigning—the M. I. A. A. team
composed of the best players from
Manila public high schools. In na¬
tional competition, it has met and
vanquished the University of the
Philippines twice, the Far Eastern
University twice, the Philippine
Women’s University twice, and the
Philippine Normal School the same
number of times.
Almost every girl of the fifty or
so studying in the high school plays
volleyball better than the average
high school player. There is no lack
of substitutes; when a member of
the team graduates, another girl is
ready to step into the former’s
shoes and fight on for dear old M. I.
Every girl, from first year up, tries
her best to make the team.
The school has two courts, one
for the regulars, the other for their
understudies. The regulars play
with the boys two hours every af-
ternoon during school days, if the
weather permits, of course. Before
an important contest they play Sat
urdays and Sundays too. They train
all through the Christmas vacation.

into the semi-finals by eliminating
Maximo Sanchez and his son Amado,
both of Managumpay, 4-6, 6-1, 4-6,
6-3, 6-1, last Friday afternoon at
the Rizal Memorial Stadium. The
same afternoon Leonardo Gavia and
Diy nosed out Rivera and Marti¬
nez, 6-0, 6-1, 6-1; Ampon and Ang
bested Guillermo Lumain and J.
Ladao, 6-1, 6-0, 6-3.

Defeating Hernandez and Saga¬
yadan at the Victoria courts last
Friday afternoon, Galvez and
Ocampo entered into the finals of
the bureau of education tennis
doubles tournament. The scores
were 9-7, 2-6, 7-5. In the other
semi-final match, Oncena and Vi¬

latter scored 293 hits the other Sa¬

a distance of 50 meters, both slow
and rapid fire being employed.
 
BOXING
Clever Henry, lightweight cham-
pion of Rizal, defeated Fighting
Abordo on a foul in the eighth of
the scheduled 10-round go at the
Maypajo Boxing Stadium last
Thursday night. Abordo tried to
knock out the colored boy in the
first rounds but the latter retaliat¬
ed with telling jabs and right


crosses to the body.
Joe Mendiola, a 2-1 favorite, was
outpointed by Cavite’s Joe Grande
in a 16-round bout before some
1,200 fans at the Baguio Rizal Box¬
ing Stadium last April 25th. The
decision was unpopular, however,
many believing that the Batangas
lad should at least have deserved a
draw.

Panique’s Clever Siso defeated
Mauricio Seria in the 8-round main

card: Clever Muring disposed of
Kid Alcantara in the first round;


Young Selmo stowed away Joe Val¬

knocked out Young Caballero in the
third; Little Javier stopped Gene

Asked as to whether autonomy
would be curtailed under the plan,
Assemblyman Sandoval replied:
“Theoretically, autonomy is cur¬
tailed because the people will no
longer exercise the right to elect
their local executives. But then
the President, the appointing power,
is the representative of the people
elevated to his position through the
ballot. Hence, his acts are also the
will of the people.

the section of pail conservancy sys¬
tem receive from P1.20 to P2.20 a
day. There are at present 192
men who are employed in this sec-
tion.
Street Cleaners
The camineros are no less im¬
portant than their confreres in the
garbage and pail division. They
may not handle stinking refuse
but they have to scrub clean no
less than 2,396,609 square meters
of city streets early at dawn eve¬
ry day—rain or shine. Manila
spent P208,879.16 for labor, P1,572.-
06 for transportation, and P289.84
for materials to keep the city


streets clean, from January 1, 1935,
to November 14th of the same year.
These men must wake up before
four o'clock in the morning so they
can be through with their work be¬
fore the traffic stirs in the city.
They are content with their work
and happy, these men who wear
red drawers over their denim long
pants.
They do all the dirty work, these
public servants who work when
others are snoring on their beds,
and they are not only not appre¬
ciated but are even despised.

AS A THIEF...

“I should like to know if this wit¬
ness ever had any Liquor Arsenica¬
lis in her possession."
The coroner held up a warning
hand to Madeline, and replied:
“That question, Sir, is not ad¬
missible. It is a principle of Eng¬
lish law that a witness cannot be
compelled to make a statement in¬
criminating him—or herself. But
an affirmative answer to this ques¬
tion would be an incriminating
statement."
“But I am perfectly willing to an¬
swer the question,” Madeline said
eagerly. “I have never had in my
possession any Liquor Arsenicalis
or any other preparation of arse¬
nic."
“That answers your question,
Sir,” said the coroner, as he wrote
down the answer, "and if you have
nothing more to ask, we can re¬


lease the witness.”
He handed his pen to Madeline,
and when she had signed her de¬
positions—a terribly shaky signa¬
ture it must have been—she came
back to her chair, still very pale
and agitated, but obviously relieved
at having got through the ordeal. I
had taken her arms as she sat down
and was complimenting her on the
really admirable way in which she
had given her evidence, when
heard the name of Anthony Wal¬
lingford called and realized that an¬
other unpleasant episode had ar¬
rived.

"No, not easy, but it gave me the
opportunity to do the kind of work
I’d been trying to do.”
“What are the pictures you’ve al¬

Mr. Duran mentioned the follow-
ing: From Columbia studio Roam¬
ing Lady, Nothing Ever Happened
That Night, Lost Horizon (now in
production); from M-G-M, Viva
Villa; from Paramount—Last Out¬
post; from miscellaneous studios¬
Rescue, The Last of the Pagans,
Four Frightened People, Mutiny on
the Bounty, China Seas, East of Ja¬
va, What Price Decency, and two
Spanish versions, La Dama Atrevi¬
da, El Cuerpo Del Destino.
Asked if he was contemplating to
go back home, Mr. Duran flipped:
When Mr. de Castro is already a


director, then I’ll go home.”
Carlos de Castro, the Filippine
Films actor, who was listening at¬
tentively during the interview, pat¬
ted Mr. Duran’s heavy shoulders
and said, “Yeah, Mr. Duran will be
my leading man and star."
Just how this unguarded kidding
will turn up in the next few years,
your guess is as good as mine. At
any rate, we have now several ac¬
tors in Hollywood who are steadily
getting somewhere. Mr. de Castro
naively reports that he has already
secured an extra job at $100 a week.
He saw Frank Capra at last and the
latter put him into "something" in
his The Lost Horizon.

—12:15 to be exact—last
P April 23rd, a destructive fire
broke out in one of the most con¬
gested sections of the commercial


district of Surigao, Surigao. The

and the mouth of the Surigao

A partial view of the commercial district of Surigao, which was razed to the ground.


houses, was razed to the ground in
less than half an hour by what is
considered the biggest conflagra¬
tion the Surigao capital has
known.
The most conservative official
figures place the total damage at
P60,000; unofficial estimates place
it as high as ₱100,000, including
real property and personal belong¬
ings. Gui Hiap’s store, valued at
₱20,000, according to municipal
treasury figures, was the starting
point of the fire, and was among
those completely razed down.
The fire, according to prelimin¬
ary investigations made by the
Army authorities, was of accidental
origin. It is said a certain Chinese
storekeeper of Gui Hiap’s Store un¬
consciously (it is alleged) threw a
lighted cigarette butt on a pile of
abaca fibers in the building. How¬
ever, the authorities are still dig¬
ging up possible clues for incen¬
diarism. Several Chinese have
been grilled but until the time of
writing, no definite cause of the
fire had been ascertained.
Viewed by the writer from the
window of his office in the sec-
ond story of the provincial build¬
ing, which is but a stone’s throw
from the scene of conflagration, the
tongues of flame reached out from
the ceiling of Gui Hiap’s Store with
such intensity that they soon set
the surrounding houses on fire.
The Burgos street which crosses
the Borromeo and San Nicolas
streets was soon impassable due to
the extreme heat. Gui Hiap’s Store
was razed to ashes in short order,
while a group of terror-gripped
spectators looked on helplessly.
Simultaneously, the residence of
Attorney Hernando J. C. Corvera
(who was in Cagayan, Oriental
Misamis, at the time of the con¬
flagration) was reduced into a
smoking debris. The attorney’s in¬
valid grandmother would have been
burned alive, had she not been res¬
cued by a quick-witted American
mestizo, Charlie Meehlieb.
Losing all hopes of saving any of
the above-mentioned buildings, in¬


cluding the bodega of Vicente Yu¬
caco just opposite that of Corve¬
ra’s, the poorly-equipped fire¬
fighters centered their efforts
in saving the home of Jose Tumu¬

Not Responsible to People
“Yes, why not! Those appointees
are not responsible to the people,
hence the latter cannot control those
abuses by removing them at the
next elections. Now you say these
appointees are investigated, that is
true. But the quizz is done only
by superior officers of the depart-
ment to which these appointees be¬
long, hence things are frequently
hushed up in a manner only too
familiar to the general public."
Consult The People
Even Assemblyman Juan L. Luna
of Mindoro frowns at the idea as
impractical, as productive of dis¬
satisfaction among the people.
“We must first be sure the in¬
novation will be of weighty advant-
age to the people,” Assemblyman
Luna declared. “The people should
be consulted first, to find out if they
want any change at present.
"Offhand, however, I believe no
change in the conduct of local gov¬
ernment should be made—unless it
is for the better. Take Mindoro,
my province, as an example. We
had appointive governors from
1901 to 1916. While administra¬
tion then might be called effective,
yet the people were not satisfied
because the provincial governors
responded primarily to the policies
of the insular administration. Par¬
ticular interests of the Mindoro
people were disregarded at times,
just to comply with the superior or¬
ders of the department of interior.”
Democracy would give way to
dictatorship, and a great portion of
the people’s freedom to participate
in governmental affairs would be
surrendered to only one man made
strong by his high position, thus
declared Assemblyman Jose Zulueta

Against Democratic Growth
“If those two positions were made
appointive, then the remaining elec¬
tive positions could be easily re¬
duced to mere appointments too,"
Assemblyman Zulueta pointed out.
"Now that would be against the
growth of our democratic govern¬
ment. Under the plan, the power
to remove and punish an official
would be difficult to exercise. His
position is not elective, hence he is
not responsible to the people, but
to the power that appointed him.
Besides, no renovation in the local
government should be made because
things now are functioning in nor¬
mal order, with economy and effi¬
ciency being accomplished to the
advantage of the people.”


EFFICIENCY—NIL
Continued from page 5o


tried out here, to best suit local con¬
ditions.
From the standpoint of efficien¬
cy, Professor Melquiades J. Gam¬
boa, of the College of Law, U.P., de¬
clared that “the present system of
municipal government in Manila is
the worst imaginable. It is impos¬
sible to locate responsibility because
while the City Fathers are elected
by the people, the Mayor is appoint-
ed by the President of the Common-
wealth. Nothing, let it be said, is
gained by extending to the city ad-
ministration the principle of separa¬
tion of powers which obtains in the
National Government.”
Further explanation from Prof.
Gamboa: “Under the city manager
form of municipal government, ex¬
perts are brought into the service of
the city. It tends to eliminate poli¬
tics from the administrative ser¬
vice, because experts are selected on
the basis of fitness, efficiency, and
broad experience. They are never
elected, hence a divorce of persounel


from politics.
“The City-Manager Plan is simi¬
lar to the organization of a private
business corporation in that the
voters correspond to the stockhold-
ers, the Council to the board of di¬
rectors, and the City Manager to
the general manager of the firm.
“The greatest advantage of the
plan is that it concentrates respon¬
sibility on the shoulders of one man
who is hired on a business basis for
the purpose of running a city in a
business-like and efficient way."
Even President Manuel de la
Fuente of the Manila city board is
of the opinion that Manila ought to
be given a better and more progres¬
sive city administration than what
it has at present. There is no har¬
mony and frequently no cooperation
between the executive and legisla¬
tive branches of Manila’s govern¬
ment.
"I had thought of suggesting that
the post of mayor be made elective,
so that its occupant should be res¬
ponsible to the people. Buz the city
manager plan will be very much bet¬
ter for Manila. With the cisy coun¬
cil elective, with it empowered to
hire a city manager and tell him
what to do, there will be no dead¬
locks,
n o mayor-and-ccuncilor
squabbles," said President de la
Fuente. "At the same time, the ci¬
ty board will have a chance to give
the people of Manila what they
need; a city administration run
economically and efficiently."

COMMENTS
WELCOME EEWO days from now, the first group of Filipino
A repatriates are expected to arrive from the
United States. These men, far from being liabilities and a possible me¬
nace to the community, are potential assets and are entitled to all
the cooperation and understanding the community is capable of extend¬
ing to them. They are not failures by any means. They have at least
tried, and if they have not attained the heights to which they have as¬
pired, it is because the odds have been too overwhelming against them.
The failures are those who have not even tried to amount to something.
On the whole, these compatriots of ours are bringing with them
a new attitude which can be very useful to sleepy towns for which they
are now bound. Their experiences, for the most part wholesome and
valuable, can well be enlightening to those with whom they have come
home to live again. They should, therefore, be welcome.
But to the repatriates we wish to say this: You need not look
and act defeated. You are not, from any standpoint, that. On the
other hand, you need not make matters more difficult than they are.
We who have remained in the homeland may appear slow and
practically unchanged, but your broader experience should enable you
to make allowances. It may seem hard for us, at least in beginning
to see eye to eye with you, but we would in time, if you are patient
enough. We have our own difficulties here and you will be making things
worse if you sulk and breed discontent with your attitude.
PEAKER Montilla last week sent a circular to all
JUNKETS
n.embers of the National Assembly extending to
them President Quezon’s invitation to a legislative trip to Mindanao and
other ports of the south.
Now, it would be wise to remember that similar trips have been
organized in the past. The resuits are more or less known. While it
is true that many of those who joined the previous trips of investiga¬
tion, so-called, exerted real and honest efforts to realize the objectives
of the trips, it is just as true that practically nothing has been done
about the problems these inspections were supposed to solve.
The present earnestness of President Quezon to solve the Min¬
danao question fully justifies the scheduled trip. However, it should
be hoped that this projected tour would be more fruitful than the pre¬
vious ones.
NECAUSE of the impressive showing made by
VOLUNTEERS
O the 6th Division (Bacolod, Occidental Neg-
ros) of the National Volunteers during a recent military review herd
in honor of President Quezon, all troops and units of the National Vol¬
unteers of the Philippines were, it is said, assured real arms by the
chief executive.
In the exemplary soldierly conduct of the volunteers of Occiden¬
tal Negros, President Quezon undoubtedly found sufficient grounds to
justify the promise. But because it is unwise to judge the whole by a
part, it is not wise to believe that all volunteer units are as meritorious
as that in Bacolod.
VERY time Labor Day comes around,
NOT BY BULLETS
Ethe police arm themselves to the teeth:
rifles, riot guns, and gas bombs are placed within easy reach; an arm-
ored car is held in readiness; plainclothesmen snoop around corners.
There is nothing wrong with the police force’s preparing for any
emergency: this display of preparedness has without doubt successfully
thrown a damper on many a would-be rioter. And it must be admit¬
ted that it is less costly in terms of human lives to abort a riot than
try to stop it after it has started.
But there is nothing the police can do to wipe out the restless-
ness and discontent among the masses. If there is discontent, and
there is to all appearances, it is the source of this discontent which must
be looked into. Disorder must be prevented, of course. But let the
government be more assiduous in getting at the bottom of the discon-
tent of the people. The solution lies there.

Army Stuff
y E believe the recent promo¬
Wtions in the army had af¬
fected the Editor rather badly. It
must have fanned into fire the glow
of megalomania in him. We under¬
stand he is thinking of reorganizing
his staff along army lines, some¬
thing like this:
Editor—major general
Associate Editor—brigadier
general
Star reporter—colonel
No. 2 reporter—lieut, colonel
No. 3 reporter—major
Etc.
He has not as yet formally an¬
nounced the reorganization because
there is still a little problem stump-
ing him. It seems, after every mem¬
ber of his staff has been given his
corresponding commission, the
messenger ranks third lieutenant.
No non-commissioned officers, no
privates.


We are beginning to suspect we
are beginning to think of bigger
things ourself. We are now, for
example, thinking that there are
national problems we alone can
solve. But we have to become
president of the Commonwealth
first to be able to save the nation.
And we are too young, according
to the Constitution, to be president.
You should not be surprised if
you hear a move to amend the Cons¬
titution so those of our age can be¬
come president. Anyway, there is
a plan to tinker with the Constitu¬
tion to give the Commonwealth
president a chance to keep his seat
two terms in a row.
Anybody else wants to fool
around with the fundamental laws?
