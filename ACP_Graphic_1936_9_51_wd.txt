“Yes, Mr. Esteva, I am glad to see you and to answer
your questions," greeted President Campos, national¬
ly known head of the Bank of the Philippine Islands.
“Mr. Campos, many others and myself are much in¬
terested in your views of life insurance. As an ex¬
perienced banker, you are familiar with men of all
is of life, from executives to clerks, and as a keen
ness man you naturally must know something of
personal affairs. When asked for advice, just
t do you say regarding life insurance?”
ust answer your rather general question, in a
ral manner. I am in favor of life insurance. I
plenty, personally, and am a strong believer in
it ior every person that has a family. Just what kind
of life insurance and how much must be decided by
the individual concerned.


“For young men, life insurance has a special

young man who owns a policy and keeps it u
gular payments thereby acquires the habits o
and promptness. He learns thrift because
save to meet his payments. He acquires pro
as a virtue from the habit of meeting his ir
obligations on a given date.
“And just a few words about the man with
children. I think some insurance should be a

actly how such a requirement could be made,
legally. From the many instances I have e

yE have a hazy remembrance of one
hot June day some ten years ago
when we were handed two rolls of
parchment, and feeling like we would, and
could, turn the world upside-down, what
with that hair-raising commencement ad-
dress the university prexy had just let out
of his venerable chest, But now fully ten
vears later, working for a living we never
dreamed of during our college days, we
are frankly puzzled if, were we to live our
life all over again, we would go to col¬
lege. Do we regret having gone to col¬
lege? Our answer is: yes and no. Yes,
we regret it because we went to college,
very definitely, to better prepare ourself
for a particular calling. And we did not
even get a chance to show what we could
do in our profession after we left the uni¬
versity! And, since we had to eat and pay
our debts, we had to turn to the first
thing that came our way. It happened to
be the newspaper. But college failing us
in a material way, we would hesitate to
say that college for us was entirely use¬
less. Why? That’s hard to answer. But
we feel that even in our present work,
college training has helped us a lot.
But were we asked to decide one way
or another: to go or not to go to college,
we would prefer to go to college if we
could afford it, if we could wait after gra¬
duation looking for a job in our line with¬
out feeling that we have cheated our pa¬
rents out of their hard-earned savings.
Otherwise, we would not go to college.
We would start working, homesteading
maybe.
And a big problem the thousands of
parents of high school graduates have in
their hands this week. It is a problem
every parent has to solve for himself: to
send or not to send a daughter or son to
the university. But it would not hurt any
father or mother to know just what two
prominent Filipino business men say
(page 4) on the matter.
y F you have been following the work
of the National Council on Education,
you will notice that the question of econ-
omics is being given most serious consi¬
deration in the reshaping of the country’s
educational system. It is economics that
is the great Philippine problem. And if
you think that the people are not awaken¬
ing to its importance we can disprove it
by saying that ever since we published our
article on Derris (May 7, 1936), we have
been receiving endless inquiries about it.
And there is talk of producing in the Phil-
ippines all the presently imported pro¬
ducts which can be produced here. But
how? On page 8 we have an article by
Judge Guillermo Guevara who, by the
way, is a manufacturer of rubber shoes.
He has just returned from a trip to Japan
and his views regarding economic na¬
tionalism for the Philippines should be
instructive to every one.
UT you cannot talk much on econo¬
B mics without thinking of the com-
mon tao who, after all, is a part, and a

major part, of the worries of the nation.
Has it ever occurred to you that the com-
mon tao is a very indifferent individual,
a fellow who is down and does not care, as
F. R. Fernando claims on page 10?
ET us turn to sociology. U. S. Fili¬
Lpinos have added to their economic
problems the problem of sociology and be¬
cause this involves brown-white relations,
there has been trouble every now and
then. P. C. Morantte has gotten hold of
no less than a world authority on social
problems, Dr. Popenoe of Los Angeles, to
express his opinion (page 12) concerning
the association of Filipino boys and white
American girls, mostly questionable dance
hall girls, according to Dr. Popenoe. And
speaking of dance hall girls, better turn
to page 16, and find out what Guinobatan
ladies have to say about bailarinas.
y E can go on waxing hot, so to
speak, on this week’s issue, but
what is our table of contents for,
anyway? However, we wish to say
that this week’s short story by Miss
Antonia Bisquera (Shooting in Suyo)
is likely to make you question our
sanity. At the end of the story, you will
likely ask yourself questions and failing
to answer them, you will look daggers in
our direction. But you will ask questions.
Miss Bisquera, does
not write short stories
very often, we under¬
stand. She has written
two other stories for
 : Tryst, list¬
ed by Jose Garcia Villa
as among the best Fili¬
pino short stories in
1934, and At Cross Pur¬
poses, published March
7 1935, listed by Villa in
A. Bisquera his Yearbook In dex
(October, 1934, to Sept-
ember, 1935).


Y E have seen many a landscape
Wpainting on our cover, but the one
we have on the cover of this issue is
among the best. The meandering brook,
the surrounding vegetation, and the
strong contrast of shadow and light (are
these proper terms?) make the pastoral
scene so familiar—and the painter re-
fused to spoil it all with lovers mooning
somewhere in the shade.
The painter, Jose Tu¬
paz, Jr., studied painting
and engraving in the
School of Fine Arts, U.P.,
for two years and was la¬
ter appointed scientific
artist, botany depart¬
ment, bureau of science,

paz is only twenty-one years old.

COMMON WELFARE, FIRST


YOT long ago, in a speech delivered by the President be¬
N fore teachers in Baguio, he stated that our Constitu¬
tion regards the welfare of the state, the common welfare,
that is, as paramount.
No constitution would be worth the paper it was written on
if it did not consider the promotion and safeguarding of common
welfare as its highest objective. If it allowed dubious interpre¬
tations as to permit a few individuals, claiming constitutional
rights, to enjoy unusual privileges at the expense of the rest of
the populace, this constitution had better be discarded or radically
overhauled.
A case in point: The President has been criticized in various
quarters for deciding against the collector of customs who wanted
the National Rice and Corn Corporation to pay duty on the rice it
imports. It is claimed that the President has no right to rule over
the legality or illegality of this order of the collector of customs.
The right belongs to the courts, it is so specified in the Constitu¬
tion. The collector of customs should have been allowed to impose
the required duty and if the NRCC wanted to dispute the ruling,


it could go to the courts for redress.
It could have been worked out that way. But with this result:
while the lawyers are mauling each other in court and the court
taking all the time necessary to settle the controversy, the masses,
suffering as they are from insufficient income, will have to be
charged exorbitant prices, which, plainly, they will not be able
to meet.
The Constitution it seems is being invoked on the
question of the right to profit. But have not the masses
the privilege to invoke the Constitution on this question:
the right to eat? On these questions, has any self-re¬
specting chief executive, who claims the Constitution
holds the welfare of the state as paramount, any choice?
If later on, the courts should find no alternative but to declare
the President’s act with respect to the rice controversy unconsti¬
tutional, there must be something awry in the Constitution that
should be remedied at once. There should be no opportunity for
the chief executive and the courts to differ on the fundamental
question of common welfare.

Spain. The pair negotiated the
500-mile hop between North Lu¬
zon and Hongkong in six hours.
On hand at the Hongkong land-
ing field to greet the first Filipinos
to cross the China Sea by air were
airport officials, Hongkong news¬
paper men, representatives of the
Hongkong Filipino community, and
many onlookers. Among the Fili¬
pinos who met the aviators were
Ricardo Arnaiz, brother of the flier,
Lucio Ildefonso, and Pacita de los
Reyes, former Miss Philippines
who has been vacationing in Hong¬
kong for the last several weeks.
Hongkong airport officials calcu¬
lated that the “Commonwealth of
the Philippines" would land at
4 o’clock and as the clock struck
four in Hongkong without any sign
of the aviators, considerable anxie¬
ty was felt among watchers at the
landing field. The wireless station
at Pratas Island, 100 miles from
the British Colony, reported at
four o’clock that there was no sign
of the plane. At the same time, the
steamer Victoria, travelling from
Hongkong to the Philippines, re-

TO SEND OR NOT tO SEND TIEM tO COLLEOL
Two Prominent Business Men Discuss Problem

mFyou were the father of a
high school graduate, would
you send him to college?
That is the question, the prob-

of parents now that universities
and colleges in the city will soon

more than ever, the problem of
sending them or not to college is
linked with the task of envisioning

civilizing heritage into this vigor¬
ous stock, that the gifts of earth
may be more widely distributed,
and that our riches may flower into
finer manners and morals, pro¬
founder literature and saner art?”
Times Different To-day
In the old days, when college gra¬
duates were few, it was easy for a
college product to land a job. "In¬
tellectual unemployment" did not
exist then. But times have chang¬
ed. Graduating from college is not
as pleasant as it should be. To-day
he becomes the butt, the scape-goat,
the subject of discouraging re¬
marks of a hostile public.
“Sending a son to college depends
upon the son’s inclination," replied
Hermogenes Alonso, owner of the
well-known Alonso Store at the Es¬
colta, when asked whether he would
send his son to college. “If the son
is, for instance, bent on becoming
an engineer, the father, if he has
the means, must let him pursue
higher studies because he would
likely fail if he should take up ano¬
ther profession.
"But frankly speaking, with the
present financial stagnation and
with the numerous unemployed col¬
lege graduates, sending a son to
college is not wise. What would be
it’s use when, after four or six
years of college study, he would on¬
ly be employed as a clerk or mes¬
senger earning twenty-five pesos
monthly?
Teachers Turn Tailors
“I have seen many young men
who prepared themselves to be
maestros or abogados only to be¬
come tailors or stenographers. So
what is the use of going to college


these days? It is useless—only a
waste of time and money. What we
should do is to let our sons, after
finishing high school, start from
the bottom.
“There is glory and contentment
and plenty of experience in start¬
ing from the bottom. In fact, ma¬
ny of our successful business men
have hardly had an education. I
can be taken for an example.
know many people who did not go
to college to become good musicians
or first-rate tailors. But they prov-
ed themselves much better than
those who went to college. Why?
Because they had the desire to im-
prove, the inclination to attain their
ambition—things which cannot be
gained in college.
Start Working at Once
“In fact, education is never com¬
pleted in college. Experience, ini¬
tiative, and industry—personal as¬
sets we need to-day—can only be
acquired by working at once.”
Mr. Alonso, let it be told, has a
daughter who is a junior high
school student at the Far Eastern
University. Would he send his
daughter to college after gradua¬
tion, knowing fully the prevailing
conditions with regard to employ-
ment?
“I would observe her first,”
answered Mr. Alonso, "whether
she would have an inclination or a
bent of mind to succeed in the
course she would take. If going to
college is induced by this gaya-gaya
notion, or just to have a diploma,
or to secure a job after graduation,
I would stop her immediately. It
would be useless. The best thing
is for her to start working, and
through experience and initiative


become a chineleria queen or what-
not.”
An Opposite View
On the other hand, Toribio Teo-
doro, the Filipino “slipper king,”
thinks otherwise. He has had a ve¬
ry bare education; in fact he only
finished third grade. But that did
not prevent him from becoming a
business success.
“Yes, I will send my son to col¬
lege,” Mr. Teodoro revealed “Two

college depends en the

of my daughters are now studying
in the university. And, next, I will
send my two sons to study about in¬
dustries.
“But a father should guide his
son in taking a college course that
would be useful. And the student
should have an aim, he should know
where he would be after gradua¬
tion. Intellectual unemployment to¬
day is due to lack of definite aim in
life. Hence, we have many lawyers,
education and commerce graduates
who are unemployed. In truth, ma¬
ny college graduates are now only
cabecilla or jueteng collectors.

Experts Are Necded
“I believe in the opinion that our
high school people should go to col¬
lege. But they should turn out as
graduates who could develop our le¬
thargic industries. We need ex¬
perts—thousands of them. To-day,
also, our youths should know how
to buy and sell—especially how to
sell.
“The course to be chosen must be
one which will be useful to the
country. Education, law, engineer¬
ing—we have their graduates in the
waiting list, doing nothing. But
commerce and industry still remain
to be exploited, to make this coun¬
try industrial.

World Olympic games in Berlin,
cheered by hundreds of athletic
enthusiasts and friends, relatives,
and sweethearts of the boys.
Led by Simeon Toribio bearing
the Philippine flag presented to
them by President Quezon a day
before their departure, the ath-
letes—wearing their official uni¬
form of gray flannel coats, white
flannel pants, NEPA shoes and
hats, and red-white-and-blue ties—
arrived at the boat at 5 o’clock and
were promptly surrounded by en¬
thusiastic well-wishers who made
them promise to “bring home the
bacon.”
Change Boat At Hongkong
The delegation stopped at Hong-
kong last Monday morning where
the boys were scheduled to com-
pete with the Chinese and other
teams there. Early last Tuesday
morning they took the s.s. Jean
Laborde for Marseilles, France.
They will probably play also in Sai¬
gon, Colombo, and Barcelona.
The athletes will arrive in Ber¬


lin two and a half weeks before
the opening of the Olympic games
on August 1st. This will give them
sufficient time to adjust themselves
to climatic condition before the
competitions.
Accompanying the 29 athletes
were five officials: Dr. Antonio
G. Sison, head of the delegation;
Dr. Regino Ylanan, head coach;
Prof. Candido Bartolome, swim-
ming coach; Serafin Aquino, track
and field coach; Dionisio Calvo,
basketball coach.
The athletes were:

Records Broken
Perhaps it will be difficult for
our athletes to chalk up first places,
what with hundreds of athletes
competing, scores of them world-
record breakers. But the local
boys were confident of making the
world recognize these small islands
in some of the events.
Which is not surprising, as our
athletes broke several records dur¬
ing the few try-outs held at the
Rizal Memorial stadium. Last

across the distance in 1 minute
10.4 seconds. The Far Eastern
record mark of 1 minute 10.8 sec-
onds was hung up by Kawatsu of
Japan, who placed second during
the World Olympics at Los An¬
geles.
On May 13th Jikirum created a
new Philippine record in the 100-
meter free style, making the dis¬
tance in 59 seconds flat. This is
.9 second better than the old rec-
ord. Nino Ramirez likewise shat¬
tered the Far Eastern record in
the running broad jump with his
leap of 25 feet 1 inch last May 3rd.
The demolished Far Eastern rec¬
ord held by Nambu of Japan is 24
feet 10-13,16 inches.
The World’s Olympic record in
the small-bore rifle shooting was
equalled by Gison late last April,
when he hit the bull’s eye 293 times
out of a possible 300 in the slow
and rapid firing at a distance of
50 meters, “C” targets being used.
Salcedo shattered both the Phil¬
ippine and Far Eastern records in
the 100-meter dash last April 26th
when he breasted the tape in 10.5
seconds, which is .1 second better
than the P.I. and Far Eastern rec¬
ord made by de Leon.
Yldefonso, veteran Olympic play¬
er who conquered the great Koiki
of Japan, said he had regained his
old form and promised to give the
world’s best some competition in
Berlin. Simeon Toribio, also an¬
other veteran Olympian who gave
the world’s best high jumpers a
scare during one of World’s Olym-
pics, will doubtless give other high
jumpers another scare this time.

—CONOMIC nationalism! This
is the magic phrase which is
E electrifying the whole world,
above all, Europe and Japan. The
methods most known and common¬
ly used by European nations in the
practice of economic nationalism
are: (a) tariff walls against all
foreign articles which are or can
be produced locally; and (b) en¬
couraging domestic industries to
produce locally all that may be ne¬
cessary for daily use.
But among all nations who prac-
tice economic nationalism, Japan
offers the most interesting exam¬
ple. This wonderful nation did not
content itself with excluding, by
means of tariff barriers as high as
350 per cent ad valorem, all foreign
articles which may compete with
those produced locally, neither with

dedicating all its energies in the
manufacture and imitation of all
that foreign ingenuity produces or
can produce, but its paternalistic
and farsighted government, at the
end of 1931, abandoned entirely the
doctrine of laissez-faire in econ¬
omic matters and embraced with
real earnestness the principle of
moderate regulation and control of
its industries.
The following laws will. give the
reader a general idea as to how the
Japanese government assumes the
task of caring for and developing
its industries:
1.—Law for controlling princi¬
pal industries, promulgated in 1931;
2.—Manufacturing industry as¬
sociation law;
3.—Commercial association law;
4.—Exporters association law;
5.—Industrial association law;
6.—Law for regulating trade and
safeguarding commerce;
7.—Law for the prevention of il-
legal competition;
8.—Law for restricting profiteer¬
ing;
9.—Law governing conditioning
and control of important articles
for export.
Aside from these laws of a gen¬
eral character, the Japanese gov¬
ernment has promulgated, also,
special laws as:
a. Law regulating the sale of
rice.
b. Law regulating the fertilizer
industry.
c. Law regulating the oil indus¬
try.
d. Law regulating the electrical
industry.
e. Law regulating the gas indus¬
try.
f. Law regulating the fishing
industry.
g. Law regulating the export-
ation of dyes and chemical products.
All the laws which have just been
mentioned are a part of the splen¬
did economic program which the
Japanese government has devised
since 1931 in order to free itself
from the horrible claws of a world-
wide depression. That the Japanese
economic plan has been a signal suc¬
cess is shown by the incomparable
prosperity of her industrial plants,
many of which operate day and
night to meet foreign orders.
Aside from the laws just men¬

tioned, Japan, to stabilize her fi¬
nance and push forward her indus¬
tries, also effected and is still ef¬
fecting what is called rationaliza¬
tion, not only in the public service
but also in industries. By rational¬
ization in Japan is meant the sim¬
plification of work and reasonable
reduction in salaries and wages,
with a view to obtaining magimum
service at least cost. Owing to that
rationalization, Japan is able to
count upon ministers and justices
who receive no more than 6,000
yens a year, and offer manufactur¬
ed articles at prices which meet all
competition.
Another wise and farsighted po¬
licy of the Japanese government is
the admission, free of customs du¬
ty, of all basic materials, imple¬
ment, or apparatus which its manu¬
facturing industries need and
which cannot be obtained within
the empire.
The Philippines could progress
into self-sufficiency should it imi¬
tate at least some of the economic
measures which the Japanese gov-
ernment has adopted.
Without an analogous policy, the
Philippines will always be like the
present: a country paying foreign
tribute. Not long ago, as rubber
shoe manufacturer, I had the fun¬
ny as well as irritating experience
of having to import rubber from Jap-
an, in spite of the fact that the Phil-
ippines is a rubber producer, with
the result that I was able to ob¬
tain the imported rubber at a price
lower than the local product, and


notwithstanding that the imported
product had to travel from Singa¬
pore to Japan and from Japan to
Manila. And all this because the
only two rubber companies in the
Philippines impose upon the local
consumer a 10 per cent extra
charge on the ground that should
the local buyer get his rubber from
Singapore, he would have to pay
that much duty on the product any¬
way.
The government and the country
should undeceive themselves once
and for all. In the face of economic
nationalism which is dominating the
whole world, we have no other re¬
course than to produce locally most
of our daily use. To realize this, our
tariff and tax laws have to be
amended in such a manner that
while elevating 1,000 per cent ad
valorem, if necessary, the customs
duties on articles of luxury or those
which can be produced here, the
following should be admitted duty
free:
1. Machinery, implements, equip-
ment or instruments of whatever
nature, whatever may be their trade
mark and origin, for manufactur¬
ing or industrial plants within
Philippine boundaries.
2. Raw materials for said indus¬
tries, such as cotton, rubber, pa¬
per for the manufacture of cigars
and cigarettes, chemical products,
shoe leather, etc.
Besides this, a law for the subsi¬
dy or protection of purely native
Philippine industries, that is to
say, with entirely Filipino capital, as
well as the promulgation of orders
or circulars to all government of¬
fices to give preference, under
equal circumstances, to native pro¬
ducts should be made part and par¬
cel of our plan towards economic
nationalism.

y E enter almost any build¬
ing and we are greeted by
such warnings as "HATS
OFF," "SILENCE," "NO SMOK¬

SPITAL

nce we
have succeeded in pulling through
the intricacies of the city’s traf-
fic into the freer provincial high¬
ways, we are again confronted by
another set of admonitions.
"SHARP CURVE GO SLOW,
“SCHOOL ZONE GO SLOW,"
“SPEED LIMIT 30 KM.," "WIND-
ING ROAD," etc.
We Don't Believe In Signs
And now that we have made a
fair repertoire of the signs, we
next consider the public response
to them. I am afraid we are not a
nation that firmly believes in the
noble significance of signs. We do
not seem to take them very serious¬
ly; considering them merely as ca¬
sual, trifling, meaningless matters
very much like some obsolete or
overdue advertising poster. Or,
even more lamentable still, we de¬
liberate'y ignore them. Perhaps it
is because they imply a curtailment
of our freedom of action that we
virtually challenge them.
We live in an age of revolution¬
ary thoughts and actions; obeying


signs seems utterly conventional
and old-fashioned. How can a dude,
for instance, obey such a trifling
sign like "NO SMOKING ALLOW-
ED” when the flipping of a cigar¬
ette from a silver plated case and
the leisurely puffing of smoke
rings into the atmosphere are to
him gestures of elegance and poise?
And, perhaps, another reason for
our antipathy towards printed ad-
monitions is that they take for
granted a lack of sense of proprie¬
ty and good conduct on our part
that we feel insulted (being a very
sensitive race); and for the sake
of appeasing our outraged feelings
we revolt by violating them deliber¬
ately. Imagine, for instance, a per¬
fect gentleman being greeted by
that very curt, uncomplimentary
salute, "HATS OFF,” upon enter¬
ing a building. Why the impudence
and impertinence of it!
American Ladies Surprised
You are, of course, at liberty to
disagree with me; but what started
the writer to do a little thinking,
observation, and investigation on
the efficiency of signs in command-
ing respect and obedience, and
which led him to the conclusion that
we don’t believe in signs is the fol¬
lowing incident: Two American
ladies (I presumed they were tour¬
ists) entered the Manila Post Of-
fice, and approached one of those
tiny, arched windows where stamps
are sold. They were carrying a
package each, which they obvious¬
ly intended to have weighed and to
purchase the required stamps. No¬
ticing the sign above the service
counter printed in huge, black, very
readable letters which even a near-
sighted person could have decipher-
ed even without the aid of his glass¬
es, the ladies fell in line behind the
crowd of customers waiting to be
served at the window. Meanwhile
the tourists cast their glances about,
inspecting and admiring the magni¬
ficent architecture of our Post Of-
fice building. Their thoughts fi¬
nally drifted back to themselves
and they were visibly astonished to
discover that they had not advanc-
ed an inch on the "line." Tilting
their heads sideways to learn the
cause of their stagnation, they dis¬
covered that people continually


came from all sides and jostled
themselves into the thick of the
crowd, dislodging their predeces¬
sors in their strugg’e to reach the
window first. The stranded ladies
glanced behind them and discover¬


ed to their astonishment and chag¬
rin that indeed they were still at
the “trail’s end," nobody having
fallen in line after them.
“Well, I guess there’s no sense

that he can add years, if nothing
more, to his stock of worldly as¬
sets; that, like his father, he has
married and raised children at the
proper time; and that he can fold
his hands and pray to God “for his
daily bread and for delivery from
unnatural death.”
In the fact that he wants to
marry and "multiply" and that he
can pray, the common tao is a man.
But apart from this, he is not
only not a paragon for the creat¬
ures of the universe, he is less
than the least of them. A bird that
had been caged will deprive itself
of "life and all" rather than live
without liberty.
And the common tao is without
liberty. Liberty has no meaning
for him because it has no reality.
He flatters and pampers, kowtows
and salaams although in his heart
and soul he wants to curse and
give a blow, demand apology or a
“conscience-easer.” Economic in¬
stability has taught him not to be
over-jealous of his rights and pri¬
vileges as a free man. Rights and
privileges have nothing to do
with folks who do not have the
confidence to exercise them or the
ability to fight for them.
He is chronically suffering from
inferiority complex. He always

hides in corners. As a guest he is
dumb. However, his hearing is
very acute. He always has the
fear that the other guests are se¬
cretly laughing because of his un¬
couth appearance, his awkward

brilliant demonstration
of Filipino ability to
govern himself. If the
common tao fails, the
Commonwealth will not
necessarily fail, but it
follows that it can be
strong.
Ignorant of Facts
The tragedy of it is:
while our chief execu¬
tive is taxing himself
to the extreme in or¬
der to uplift the little
man, the latter does
not even know what is
being done for him,
and does not care. In¬
stead of facts about
what goes on in Mala¬
canang, his head is
full of hearsay. He
does not even know
that President Quezon
has transferred from
his Pasay home to the
historic executive man¬
sion!
does not care.
The ignorance of the
common tao is startling. That is
bad enough in itself. But what is
worse, the common tao does not
care to learn. He convinces you,
you who may believe in his possi¬
bilities, that he is satisfied being
an ignorant person: he is not a
worshipper of light. He is a disci¬
ple of the goddess of darkness.
Narrow Interests
Closely associated with the ig-
norance of the common tao is his
narrowness. If you read to him a
newspaper, you would be surprised
and pained to discover that he
would prefer to go to sleep.
“You should be interested in
what I am reading to you.” I ex¬
claimed indignantly to an old bar¬
rio philosopher whom I wanted to
interest in the Davao question.

“Those things you are reading 


are unintelligible to me,” he apo¬
logized.
The fact dawned on me that to
understand what I was reading a
background that he sadly lacked
was necessary.
“You should read a newspaper
daily so you could understand and
be interested in things provincial,
national, and wordly in scope."
“It would be just a waste of
time, money, and effort,” he said
with decision.
Surprising as it may seem he
was able to convince me that he
had no use for a newspaper! For
him, the forces which play and in-
terplay to produce life or death,
like the weather, are beyond his
control. Why should he care?
Poverty
But remove ignorance, and the
common tao will indeed still be a
helpless creature. Poverty keeps
him down. He does not have an
adequate income. Factory work-
er or farm hand, he earns barely
enough to keep body and soul to¬
gether. All he earns will not buy
him even the necessary food and
clothing for himself, let alone his
family.
Consultation with the physician
and the dentist is out of the ques¬
tion. Either costs money. And,
what’s the use? The common tao can¬
not follow the prescription, even if it
be only the pleasant dictum: "work
less, rest more.” The social order
does not permit him to have off-
hours from the murderous grind of
earning for rice, salt, and small
tinapa.
Resigned
Not having tasted of the honey
of easier existence, the common
tao is very docile. You cannot
draw from him so much as a com¬
plaint against his lot. He is thank¬
ful enough that he can stuff his
stomach with camotes or bananas
when the price of rice or corn is
so high it is prohibitive for him.
If his children grumble or ask for
a few centavos to buy a piece of
bread, he rants and scolds.
The common tao is thankful
enough that he can breathe air;

merchant marine, successfully left
her Southampton docks in England
last Wednesday, May 27th, and
departed for New York city on
her first Atlantic crossing. The
liner is under the personal com¬
mand of Sir Edgar Britten.
On the eve of the Queen Mary’s
departure, the British royal family
paid a visit to Southampton to in¬
spect the liner. King Edward VIII
went by airplane. Lieutenant H. H.
Felden, the English monarch’s per¬
sonal pilot, flew the plane during
the 31-minute hop from Windsor.
The Queen Mary is employing a
regular crew of 1,200 persons. In
her maiden voyage to New York,
the liner carried a total of 2,500
passengers who paid fares aggre¬
gating $375,000. The mammoth
liner, cost her builders more than
$35,000,000.
The Queen Mary is registered at
80,733 tons. She is driven by 16
giant turbines generating 200,000
horse power. During previous trial
runs the ship registered 29 knots
per hour. When she is broken in,
it is calculated that the Queen Mary
will develop 34 knots or about 40
miles an hour.
All the cabins in the Queen Mary
are equipped with the last word in
modern conveniences. There are
several swimming pools, tennis,
decks, movies, dancing saloons, and
well-stocked bars.
The liner is also equipped with
scientific apparatus to prevent ice¬
berg or ship collisions during foggy
nights. So scientifically was the
Queen Mary built that vibration is
almost absent.
Launching the Queen Mary for
Atlantic marine service gives Eng¬
land full realization of her dream,
that of challenging the greatness of
France’s mammoth Normandie. The
French liner, until the completion
of the Queen Mary, was the biggest
floating palace in active service.
Evidently a race for building


gigantic liners is now on. In the
United States plans are at present

DR. POPENOE COUNSELS AGAINST
INTERMARRIAGE -- EXPLAINS WIY
By P. C. MORANTTE
  Hollyw ood Correspondent


¿ErgtHE majority of unhappy
marriage cases which I
have handled happen to
touch the lives of those who have
a higher academic training," said
Dr. Paul Popenoe, internationally
known author, lecturer in and
authority on eugenics and general
director of the Institute of Fami¬
ly Relations in Los Angeles, when
confronted in his office by this
writer concerning the reason for
his contention that men want their
wives to be mentally inferior to
them. "“I have found,” he explained
from behind a big desk, tweaking
the arms of his swivel chair with
his jerky hands, as if nervous,
and shifting his eyes from the
edge of the desk to me, "that ma¬
rital disruptions among the less
educated class are not as frequent


as those of the educated class. Of
course, there are other reasons
that cause divorces, but it has
been brought to my knowledge
that the more intelligent the wife
is than the man the more unhap¬
piness there is in the home.”
“Does not intelligence of the
married couple largely determine
the security of happy married life?
Havelock Ellis says that the equal¬
ity of intelligence on the part of
man and wife is a well-nigh assur¬
ance of marital happiness, isn’t this
N
true?”
I asked Dr. Popenoe.
The doctor adjusted his specta¬
cles and looked straight at me, his
eyes sparkling, his face smiling
wisely. Then he replied in a steady
soft voice: “Partly true. There
are innumerable factors that make


for success or failure
in marriage. Intelli¬
g en c e contributes
largely to success or
happy married life, but
it also contributes large¬
ly to failure or unhappy
married life. It de¬
pends on the attitude
of the more intelligent
party towards the less
intelligent.”
“In other words, the
degree of intelligence
of both parties deter¬
mines the result of
married life?”
“It does, but not pre¬
cisely, because as I
said, there are other
factors influencing the nies: advises
success or failure of
marriage."
“What are those factors, doctor?”
I asked.
Study Necessary
“Environment, personal and fa¬
mily history, heredity, beliefs, at¬
titudes toward sex, educational
training complexes, and so on. If
the parties intending to marry
would study these problems, they
would find success in marriage.
But I am amazed at the slight at¬
tention that is paid to such impor¬
tant studies of life. It is no won¬
der there are so many divorces on
record among couples who have
been married only a few months or
even weeks.”
“Is not the laxity of divorce laws
in this country responsible for the
frequency of divorces?”
“Well, it looks as if our divorce
laws encourage divorce," said Dr.
Popenoe, squinting behind his spec¬
tacles. “But the fundamental rea¬
son underlying such marital dis¬
ruption is this: men and women,
especially the younger ones, do not
face marriage seriously; they re¬
gard it slightly, more or less a pro¬
cess of experimentation. When
they find, even without due reflec-
tion, that their experiment turns
out to be different from what they
think or believe it should be, why,
all they do is file divorce papers in
court and end marriage as quickly
as that.” He snapped his fingers
to emphasize the word “that.”
I told Dr. Popenoe that in my
country, the Philippines, there are
no such divorces and he said, "Na¬
turally, because the Philippines is
a Catholic country.”
Filipino-American Marriage
I was anxious to know Dr. Pope¬


Popenoe, warld famed authority on euge¬
against marriage ot people ot different
noe’s opinion concerning the mar¬
riage of Filipinos and American
girls. (Judge Sylvain Lazarus of
the San Francisco Municipal Court,
although he strenuously denounces
the Filipinos who have provided
him with work at the bench as sa¬
vages, admits that “the girls—
meaning white girls—are satisfied
and generally very happy in their
relations with these boys—meaning
Filipino boys.”) So I asked this
question:
“Are you aware, Dr. Popenoe, of
the fact that a number of Filipinos
are married to American girls?”
“Yes,” said the doctor, smiling.
He has a face that bears a perpe¬
tual smile.
"Have there been cases of unhap-
py Filipino - American marriage
which have come to your atten¬
tion?”
"No,” said Dr. Popenoe, "I don’t
recall any. I don’t think there has
been a case brought up to me."
“Tell me, doctor, what is your
opinion about miscegenation, parti¬
cularly between Filipino boys and
American girls?”
Not In Favor
“To tell you frankly, I am not in
favor of mixed
marriage. Iam not
saying this with
particular refer¬
ence to the Fili¬
pinos, but also to
Japanese, Chinese,
and others of a dif-
ferent race mar¬
rying American
girls. I am not
saying this on the P. C. Morantte
ground of race prejudice, but for
this reason: Filipinos, Japanese or


"Divergence of views and habits is conducive to marital unhappiness," says
Dr. Popenoe, commenting on intermarriage between foreigners and American women.

Trouble in Palestine
Arabs And Jews Fighting Again


The above phota shaws a partial view of Tel Aviv, center of Jewish settlers in
Palestine. Riotings between Arabs and Jews in Palestine have developed into the pro¬
portions of a rebellion, according to press reports last week.


NHE riotings between Arabs
and Jews in Palestine, car¬
Aried intermittently since
April 15th of this year, developed
into the proportions of an organ¬
ized rebellion when the Arabs
openly clashed with British troops
and police last May 26th. The
British forces dispersed 200 Arabs
in a short battle at Meska, near
Nazareth, but they were forced to
withdraw when fresh Arab con¬
tingents engaged them in another
sharp clash.
These anti-Jewish disorders be¬


Chinese have a totally different
background, environment, and at¬
titude toward life from that of
Americans. Such divergence of
views and habits is conducive to
marital unhappiness. I shall give
you a particular case. The other
day, a Japanese and an American
girl came to me, asking me for ad¬
vice and desirous of having their
problem solved. The problem was
this: after a few months of mar-
ried life, the American girl found
herself quite unable to conform,
much less adapt herself, to her hus¬
band’s ways and customs. In the
family of the Japanese she was not
accepted as his legal spouse. In his
country, she found herself like an
exile, alone, snubbed both by her
husband’s people and her own. So
you see, there was no way out for
her, no happiness open for such a
marriage where backgrounds are at
odds or opposed—"
Filipinos Different
"I beg your pardon for inter¬
rupting, doctor,” I said, "but with
us it’s different. American wives
of Filipinos do not experience the
same treatment from their hus¬
band’s kin either in this country or
in the Philippines. Filipinos do
their best to make the American
girls happy, and I know quite a
number of cases where the Ameri¬
can girls have been brought over to
the Is’ands and have found nothing
to complain of. In fact, it is gen¬
erally admitted by those wives I


ing committed sporadically by the
Arabs are not of recent origin. As
reported in  ’s issue of
October 9, 1929, open fighting be¬
tween them occurred that year in
several Arab cities, resulting in the
deaths of hundreds of men, women,
and children. Martial law was pro¬
claimed by British authorities, but
it was disregarded by Arabs and
Jews alike and the killings went on.
The trouble is easily understood
if it is considered that Palestine
is principally an Arab country,
while Jews are only immigrants
there. Just now there are 850,000


know that their Filipino husbands
are easier to get along with than—
“Than the American husband?”
finished the doctor.
“Yes."
“It is interesting,” he leaned for¬
ward over the desk, looking stead-
ily at me, "How do your people
treat the American wife brought
to the Philippines?”
“Well,” I said, “they treat her
fine. My people are extremely kind
to her. The kinsfolk of the husband
shower her with excessive hospital¬
ity. They do everything to please
her, even to the extent of being
stupidly solicitous. The in-law
question that troubles American
homes is practically unknown there.
At least I have never heard of an
American girl complaining about
her Filipino in-laws. Of course, I
am aware of instances where girls
who were brought to the Phi'ip-
pines as wives of Filipinos have
come back to America with the
complaint that they experienced
some physical discomforts. That is
the fault of the place, but not of the
persons, I think.”
Isolation
“Well," said Dr. Popenoe, smil¬
ing again, “I am glad you told me
that. “But,” he went on somewhat
warmed up, “the fact that these
girls have come back and have suf-
fered from physical discomforts
from the place may prove that they
did not like the place because they
(Cantinuad on paga 16)


Arabs in Palestine, and 250,000 Jews
scattered in the country. The Jews,
by their industry, are fast acquir¬
ing lands and property that are
turning them masters of Palestine,
while the Arab proletariat are
steadily becoming landless. Hence,
the vigorous resentment.
This year Arabs again brought
pressure against the Jews, their
perpetual enemies. Riots and mas¬
sacres mostly occurred in Jerusa¬
lem and immediate vicinities, re¬
sulting in casualties that daily
mounted as the disorders increased.
Since April 15th, more than fifty
violent deaths were recorded, 27 of
them were Jews, while the rest
were Arab rioters who were shot
down by police and British soldiers
in an effort to quell the riotings.
Last May 25th, Arabs fostered
new disorders resulting in an Arab
girl being killed and a British cons¬
Fur¬
table injured in Jerusalem.
ther opposition to continued Jewish
immigration into the Holy Land
was shown when fierce Arab snip-


ers fired upon British troops in
several cities. A Jewish vessel,
sometime ago, was likewise bombed
in the port of Jaffa.
Sir Arthur Granfil Wauchope,
British high commissioner for
Palestine, in an attempt to protect
Jews and end the disorders, ad-
dressed the Levant Fair and
warned the Arabs from terrorizing
Jews farther. “No strike, no vio¬
lence can deter the government
from fulfilling its obligations un¬
der the League of Nations man¬
date,” he said.
A general Arab strike is now on
in Jerusalem, while sporadic blood-
sheds have occurred in widely sepa¬
rated districts. Because of this
guerilla way of Arab riots, the
British authorities in Palestine are
finding it hard to meet the attacks
immediately. London, however, of-
ficially proclaimed that “thoroughly
adequate and organized forces" are
present in Palestine to put the dis¬
orders down soon.

Embarrassing Question
What is your best work of art?
In social gatherings, at tea par¬
ties and banquets, artists—among
them sculptors, painters, and
composers—are frequently beset
with this question. The great ma¬
jority of them, when confronted
with such a question, appear total¬
ly embarrassed and excuse them¬
selves. Others are irritated. For,
the truth is that artists in gen¬
eral (we found this out ourselves
in interviews with them) do not
gauge their works in terms of
“best" or "worst” but in the satis¬
faction they derive out of their
work. They have a measure of va¬
lue far different and far more sub¬
stantial than that used by those out
of their respective professions.
The Money Is Not All
Consider this, for instance. One
of our leading painters recently
painted for a big commercial firm
the picture of a prominent leader
for which he received the munifi¬
cent amount of P1,000. The amount
was liberal enough, considering the
fact that artists generally starve in


A picture of Fernando Amorsolo's The First Baptism in the Philippines, the
work that gave its painter the most satisfaction.


this country and the fact that only
foreigners in Manila pay, or know
how to pay, for works of art. But
the same painter who painted the
picture confides that he is not sa¬
tisfied with the picture. There
was nothing in that work, he said,
which usual'y fills his “whole being
with a flood of ecstasy and joy.” It
made him P1,000 richer, it is true,
but that did not in the least glad-
den him.
The same is revealed by Guiller¬
mo Tolentino, foremost Filipino
sculptor. He said he entered into


Guillermo Tolentina: says he has
yet to create his masterpiece.


a contract with certain public of-
ficials, to furnish a statuary group
for a public park. The work was
finished on the day the work was
desired and he was paid well for
his work. For fear, however, that
public prejudice might be created
against these statues, the sculptor
prefers not to specify the work.
However, he confides that although
he was highly renumerated for the
work, in his heart, there is nothing
in it that gives him a great deal


of satisfaction.
The Proper Question
What work of art gives you the
greatest satisfaction?
When you meet a sculptor, paint-
er or musical composer again, be
sure to ask that question. He will
be more cordial.
Fernando Amorsolo, one of the
best known of our contemporary
painters said: “I have painted hun¬
dreds of objects and I have gone
far and near to satisfy the tumult-
ous craving in my heart. But there
is not one which has thrilled me
and given me more satisfaction
than the The First Baptism in the
Philippines, a large historical
painting which was ordered and
paid for by the Cebu High School.
In the first place, the picture, is
of historic significance; it de¬
picts a very historical event in
our history. The rendering of the

Just A Portrait
Prof. Vicente Rivera y Mir who,
like Amorsolo, is connected with the
school of fine arts, University of
the Philippines, considers his "Pro¬
fessor Ferrer” as the picture which
has given him the greatest joy
upon completion. It is a portrait of
a man, a professor in painting un¬
der whom Prefessor Rivera y Mir
studied. Next to this, he mentions
"Aurora de Un Ideal” and “Un Vie¬
jo Artista.” Both have been exhi¬
bited at the Madrid Exposition.
Guillermo Tolentino who has won
fame and honor abroad, can’t
point to any particular work of his
which has given him “"utmost satis¬
faction.” “I have not produced any
work yet of which I can be proud,"
he said. "Frankly speaking I can¬
not point to a single work of mine
which I can call great. I have my
own ideas, and I have nurtured in
my heart the desire to create or
give form to my masterpiece. It
is yet to be done...”
He mentioned the Roman Salute,


Prof. Ramon Tapales: his "Mangyan,”
musical composition, has satisfied him
most.
the first work of his that attracted
wide attention in Italy and won re¬
cognition for him, as among his
works which gave him pleasure and
confidence in himself. The statue,
which has been purchased by the
Philippine government, is now at
the entrance to the National Libra¬
ry. Another is Oblation, a nude fi¬
gure in bronze which was unveiled
early this year in a very conspi¬
cuous spot in the U.P. Campus.
“But,” he said, "some people, espe¬
cially the women, do not like these
statues (Roman Salute and Obla¬
tion) because they are in the nude.
You see, some of our women are
not yet art-minded. It is recalled
that one of his many life-size sta¬
tues, executed to adorn the differ¬
ent portals of the University of the
Fhilippines, was remodelled a few
years ago because of the many pro¬
tests filed with the University au¬
thorities.


Composers
Composers are of the same class
as painters and sculptors and are
just as guarded in talking about
their work as their brother artists.


FUENTE RESENTS
GAG ORDER
Believing that undue publicity
has been given to the routine
matters of the city hall, Mayor
Posadas last week issued a cir¬
cular to the city department
chiefs calling their attention to
the circular of the mayor dated
March 13, 1929. imposing a
press censorship. The mayor
reminded the department chiefs
—he did not forget also the
tumultuous councilors — to read
the circular again and to follow
it strictly, or else.
President Manuel de la Fuen¬
te, as well as the rest of the
councilors, resented the order,
claimed that such censorship is
dangerous to the interests of the
public. “Besides,” President de
la Fuente said, “the municipal
board is a branch of the Manila
government over which the
mayor has absolutely no juris¬
diction...I want the mayor to
know that he is not my boss.”


Prof. Ramon Tapales of the con¬
servatory of music, U.P., mentioned
“Mangyan" a musical composition
for an orchestra unit, as having sa¬
tisfied him the most. “It is the
most solid of my works, and per¬
haps also the most faithful. I have
caught in it the rhythm of the mu¬
sic of the Mangyans, a native tribe
of Mindoro. Also, I consider it as
the most spontaneous of my works.”
Former Secretary Filemon Perez
of the defunct department of com¬
merce and communications said
that Kutang-Kutang, which his
daughter played on the piano dur¬
ing her graduation last March at
the Santa Escolastica College, is his
best musical composition and by
far the only one which he has ever
released to the public.
Prof. Francisco Santiago, direc¬
tor of the conservatory of music,
has perhaps composed and publish¬
ed more musical compositions than
any other living Filipino. However,
he would not state which of these
has given him the greatest satis¬
faction. His Quezon March de¬
serves special mention. It was first
blayed when President Quezon
brought home the Tydings-McDuf-
fie law.


Prof. Francisco Santiago, director of
the U. P. conservatory of music: finds it
hard to shoosa which of his campositions
has given him most satisfaction.

HONEST AND REAL FREE OFFERING


To all students who pay fully in cash tuition fees the following courses
are offered free of study:
Stenography
Home Cooking
Journalism
Flower Making
Typewriting
Advertising
Diploma
Salesmanship
Spanish
This offer is nat a bait nor a trick. It is real and hanest.
Our departments are under the care of experts in their respective lines. Mast
of them count with over ten years’ experience and some are graduates from foreign
countries.
Our directress, Mrs. Ygnacia T. Lanus, spent seven and a half long years in the
United States and Europe ta learn and acquire her unique and superior technique
and knowledge in our lines. She suent thousands of dollars to study in foreign
lands and practiced in more than One Hundred Organizations and Institutions in
New York, Chicago, Baston, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in the United States and
in London. Berlin, Paris and Florence in Europe.
Our Academy is backed up hy a serious and reliable institution like the Manila
Collese of Pharmacy & Dentistry with a capital of P200.000.00.
Our directress spent a lifetime in this line and specialized in these arts of
vocatianal wisdom.
You cannat have samething for nothing. This life is a game of give and taka.
So, when you are offered free of this and free of that, you should not heed it
because hehind this game there is a catch to take yaur money one way or the
nther, and yau do not get what you are after.
Our institution is the most reliable in this line because it has something to
lose if we fool around—Its renutation, credit and capital. Sa we cannot afford to
appeal to all of these balderdashes af free of matriculation hecause we pay em¬
ployees and instructars. We cannot offer free and afterwards get the money of
the students in other tricky way. We cannot afford to offer free materials he¬
cause the paper and cloth-dealers charge us money on their goods. Wa do not do
the dirty tactics of offering free of materials to students and charge tham thrice
the price afterwards. And besides this is not an honest husiness.
We do not charge additonal fees for additional time, if the students could not
possibly accomplish their courses in its time of schedule. Whether they graduate
in three months or it takes them a longer period to finish, the fee is fixed until
the satisfactory completion of the coursas.
More than 1300 graduates of this ACADEMY seattered all over the 45 prov¬
inces without a single case of failure in their profession are the hest testimany of
the superiority of our methad of training. They are the emhodiment of efficiency
in their respective lines. Their craftamanshin is excellent and they produce all
the time satislactory joh. In one ward we do not praduce mere “costureras" or
workers hut real, efficient and competent modistes, stylists and dressmakers.
Our graduates are the pride of their folks, an asset to their ecunamic life and
a credit to their communities.
Ask a “Gala” graduate in your province and she will shaw you her superiar
craitsmanship in her line.
Our institution is not a ilving school that stays one month in one place and
then mave continuously to all the places of the city all the time like a peddler of
mercenary goods. We have our awn huilding, our own secial hall and we do not
hire places for our graduation exercises for sacial gatherings.
Our Academy is an institution in all sense and not a peddling fashion school,
appealing to cheap and unethical tactics to fool the public.
We lead. We do not
We do not imitate. We create. We do not follow.
demoralize the profession by reducing prices of tuition fees like a Chinese "sari-sari"
store, hut we dignify the vocation. We da not confuse hut we produce and help
the community to build up a trade. Our graduates are builders and not spoilers
of the prefessian.
Our method is the only method of training selected by the government school
teachers and supervising teachers, because it is practical, simple, efficient, stand¬
ard and adapted from the most modern and reliable method of the most progres¬
sive fashion centers in the most advanced countries in this line.
We do nat adapt the methad of "Patong" pattern.
Our method is unique because it is the product of many years of sacrifices
and conscienciaus studies of our directress in foreign countries which costed her
thousands of dollars to acquire it.
Before you take a definite step to enroll in any fashion school yau better in¬
vestigate carefully its reputation, background and the reliability of the school for
your own gond and protection.
The Gala Fashion Academy stands for its credit, its name, its reputation and
its background which are monuments for its achievement.
You are guaranteed to come out after graduation in our institution a real,
competent, efficient and a reliable modiste, stylist or dressmaker, and nat as a
mere “costurera” nor an ordinary worker.

Y HAT! Guinobatan, the town
Wof Bailarinas?
Greatly scandalized were
members of Albay’s Guinobatan
Women’s Club at the appearance
of Mr. Vic. O. Ballesfin’s recent
  article, "Guinobatan
—T o w n of Bailarinas.” They
gathered at the municipal build¬
ing to make public denunciation
of his article, and to refute his
statements in turn.
And this is the answer of the
Guinobatan Women’s Club:
Albay is an abaca producing re¬
gion, hence the people’s callings
are essentially agricultural in na¬
ture. There can therefore be no
justification to the Ballesfin pub¬
lication. For, to support his news,
did he take note of bailarinas from
the town and compare their num-
ber to the Guinobatan census per¬
taining to women?
It is true there are cabaret danc-
ers here, but they come mostly
from the uneducated class especial¬
ly from the barrios and mountain
cutposts. So for him to say that
Guinobatan is the town of bailari¬
nas, when it is impossible to prove
50 per cent of the girls there are
dancers, is to put a blot on his
home town and a stain to his own
family!
Again, Mr. Ballesfin committed
an error when he said that Guino¬
batan thinks nothing is wrong
when a girl turns a bailarina. To
tell the truth, women here are ful¬
ly conscious of where that kind of
life will lead to, that is why they
do not even want to think of it.
Mr. Ballesfin, in his article,
made positive assurance that in 8
out of every 10 cabarets the-danc-
ers are natives of Guinobatan.
May we ask him if he has been-to


every cabaret in the Islands? And
whether he has canvassed those
girls to find out their home towns?
His article gave neither credit
nor sympathy to the town dancers.
On the contrary, he made them ap-
pear steeled to that kind of calling,
and gave them encouragement to
go on, that way, to help the town
coffers. Thus he proved himself
to be an unworthy companion that
will not lead a wandering sheep
that has strayed from the flock.
Guinobatan, our town, is never
too greedy to exchange the honor
of her women for filthy lucre! She
is always for the glorification of
her women—never for their en¬
slavement.
Guinobatan, although a second-
class municipality, is a big town
with modern conveniences. Its
various industries and rich agri¬
cultural products support the
town’s needs. And if there is any
plan for the reconstruction of the


WHAT GUINOBATAN, ALBAY,
WOMEN ARE FURIOUS ABOUT
Mr. Ballesfin says in his
article, "Guinobatan—Town of
Bailarinas":
Guinobatan, Albay, is known
all over the Bicol communities,
and to some extent in the prov¬
inces bordering Manila, as the
home towir of bailarinas—rather
saloneras if there is any differ¬
ence in the meaning. Any Gui¬
nobatan lass, connected with the
business or not, will shameless¬
ly corroborate this—always with
this defense, of course: there is
nothing dishonorable in being a
salonera. I, too, uphold such an
assertion because I am a Guino¬
bateno. And probably I shall be
cursed rather than praised by
even my relatives for may pains,


Bailarinas


town’s municipal building, the ex¬
penses will be defrayed by the mu¬
nicipality’s resources, not through
the efforts of dancers as insinuat¬
ed by Mr. Ballesfin.
Guinobatan women are honest
and vituous, they are dutiful
housewives, teachers, independent
retail storekeepers, and students.
That is why Mr. Ballesfin is to be
criticized just as much as we con¬
demn Judas for selling Jesus
Christ for a paltry thirty pieces of
silver!

found that comforts they have been
accustomed to were wanting over
there, don’t you see? Theirs is a
case where environment contributes
to failure in marriage between
your men and American girls. Even
if these comforts or luxuries could
be provided the girls, mind you, af¬
ter a number of say, five or ten
years, the wife who has gone to
live there in the foreign country
would feel the sense of isolation, of
aloneness, of distance from her own
people, and in that case she would
be miserable. She would long to
come back to America, and if the
husband permits her to do so, mar¬
riage has become a failure. If the
husband accompanies her for her
sake, he would surely experience
the same internal problems which
assailed his wife while she was
with him in his country. No, I
think it is better to marry in one’s
own group, to prevent intermar¬
riage between Filipino boys and
American. girls.”
“There is, I understand, a law in
California to that effect,” I said.

Ahe Aerense
of Malolos
Spaniards Attacked Town To
Regain Control, June 1, 1897-
Were Repulsed
By MABINI REY. CENTENO


YNO the people of Malolos, Bu¬
la can—especially to the
I dwindling remnants of revo¬
lutionary heroes—the memory of
June 1st, 1897, will linger with
them to the end of their days.
For it was on that date that Fili¬
pino patriots undertook the de¬
fense of Malolos, albeit with the
loss of many lives, to keep back
the Spanish troops that attacked
the town from the northeast.


Gen. Isidoro Torres: successfully de¬
fended Malolos, Bulacan, in 1897.


Bulacan, let it be proudly told.
was among the first seven prov-
inces that revolted against Spain
when Andres Bonifacio gave the cry
at Balintawak. And Malolos, with
native bravery, successfully over¬
threw the Spanish authority in the
town. But, because of the town’s
strategic importance, the Spaniards


wanted to regain it from the re-
volutionists.
Two Days Preparation
By gravepine telegraphy, how¬
ever, the plan of the Spaniards to
attack Malolos came to the knowl¬
edge of General Isidoro Torres,
commanding the town forces, two
days before June 1st, the day for
the attack. That gave the town
and the revolutionists time to make
defense preparations.
On June 1st the sky was over¬
cast. Very early in the morning
rain started falling. Then the six
o’elock train, on which the Span¬
ards were expected, arrived at the
station. As the train puffed in,
the Spanish troops started firing.
The attack on Malolos was on!
Filipino Soldiers Deploy
The Filipino patriots, however,
were ready for them. Defending
the right side of Catmon bridge
was a group of soldiers under Do¬
roteo Karagdag. Scattered along
the railroad tracks that pass
through Barrio Caniugan were other
soldiers. Still another detachment
under Catalino Francisco. Enting
“Batangan,” Vicente Villavicencio,
all well armed, was defending the
sector covering the Barasoain
cemetery and the road leading to
Catmon bridge.
The Spaniards had left the

station and were advancing towards
the town. The battle continued for
four hours without any respite. At
ten o’clock one of Karagdag’s men
was taken away, wounded. A few
hours later, the brave Enting “Ba¬
tangan" was dead.
Fighting "Kabisa” Dies
By this time, the Spaniards had
taken Catmon bridge and crossed it.


Courageous revolutionists tried to
check them, while "Kabisang” Ente
(Vicente Villavicencio) led the de¬
fense firing behind a wooden mor¬
tar which he had rolled near the
road to Barrio Liyang.
Without reinforcements, "Kabi¬

the invaders at bay. But about

RHEUMATIC PAINS
People once had to go away for rheumatism, take min¬
eral baths, or drink medicinal waters. Then came the
first real relief—salicylates. 6 Today, there is a remedy
twice as effective as salicylates: Canaspirina. It brings im¬
mediate and effective relief from the suffering caused by
rheumatism. 9 So, don’t go through another season of
suffering, or any more “bad days” with rheumatism.
Cafiaspirina usefulness isn’t limited to headaches or colds!
It brings the same remarkable relief in
rheumatism, neuritis, lumbago, or sciatica.
And it is safe;, it does not depress the heart.

yT was on the Sambrano Express
Suyo-bound that I learned about
the shooting in Suyo.
You know how people get chummy
n a bus: riding together through
the long dusty kilometers, without
leg or elbow room, bored by the flat,
unchanging scenery, depressed by
the even hum of the motor This
day the Express was loaded to capa¬
city, and I found myself sitting
shoulder to shoulder with another
passenger a young man like my¬
self.
Straightening stiffened elbows
we dug each other in the ribs. In
mutual apology we smiled, and he
remarked, "Nice weather?”
 looked obligingly out of the bus
into a bit of blue sky that showed
over the dusty, scraggy tops of
tamarinds on the horizon “Nice.
isn’t it?” I responded without
much enthusiasm.
For a while we spoke about many
inconsequential things which did


not prove rousing enough to make
us forget the general ennui, when
he mentioned the happening in
Suyo.
"Have you heard of the shooting
in Suyo?"
"No."
"A leaf-tobacco agent was shot
dead I believe."
“Oh.
When was that?”
“Don’t know exactly. About a
week ago, I think."
I mumbled dully, "Leaf-tobacco
agent.” Then my mind caught on.
I knew a leaf-tobacco agent in Suyo,
Marcelino de Leon, but I knew he
was somewhere in the Cagayan Val¬
ley on business. Absent about six
months now In fact I was on my
vay to visit with his wife, whom
I knew But then there were many
leaf-tobacco agents in Suyo How¬
ever, I asked, “What’s the name of
his agent?”
"I don’t remember now” the
voung man said. “Tll ask Pedro.”


The young man turned around to
another passenger, who was dozing
beside him, chin on chest He shook
him awake "What fellow got shot
n Suyo?” he asked, and he had to
repeat his question before it sank
in
“Someone by the name of de Le¬
on,” Pedro informed him sleepily.
“Not Marcelino!” I exclaimed.
“The same, sir," said Pedro, and
then his eyelids began to flutter
and his chin to sag on his chest.
"Do you know de Leon?” asked
the young man when we had taken
our eyes off our drowsy companion.
“Yes, I know him,” I said rather
absently So Marcelino had come
back. But what should I expect?
Stay away for all eternity? Shot
dead! I could hardly believe the
elderly bald-headed de Leon, whom
I remembered very well, was dead.
And Matilda—what of her?
“But who shot him?” I inquired,
the while my brain considered all


the consequences of the shooting of
Marcelino de Leon.
“His wife did.”
I gripped the edge of my seat
suddenly The bus had lurched
around a corner.
"His wife?” I echoed dully.
"His wife,” he affirmed, looking
“She shot him
at me curiously.
hrough the heart with a shotgun."
Not Matilda! Matilda wouldn’t
shoot anyone, much less her hus¬
band. She wouldn’t harm a fly.
Matilda, with her small white
hands, so—so like flowers. Would
she raise a shotgun at anyone?
“Why did Matilda do it?” n
asked casually “I mean, his wife,"
I added, responding to the puzzled
look in the young man’s eyes.
The young man nodded at the
sleeping Pedro. He said, "I don’t
know I learned it all from him.
By the way, it seems to me you
know these people quite well."
“Yes,” I said. “I know them

it, I wonder? She’d never harmed
a thing in her life. She couldn’t
think of murder. Knowing her,
you would say the same thing your¬
self."
We remained silent for a while. I
was thinking, could they have quar¬
reled, and Matilda had shot him,
supposing she could think of shoot-
ing after all? But who would have
reason to be sharp with Matilda?

if not impossible, to tell whether it
was a Japanese or an American you
were listening to. He was second
to none in the whole program. Bet¬
ter than those from Paris, Spain,
etc. OR EVEN LONDON. He des¬
cribed himself as "a staff an¬
nouncer” of that Japanese station.
I couldn’t quite get his name... nor
could anybody else on a bet!
And that one who spoke for Ma¬
nila (my own personal honest opi¬
nion, take it or leave it!) was the
most unintelligible of all the speak¬
ers. His accent was so heavy, one
couldn't tell what language he was
trying to pour into the mike ... the
listener couldn’t tell when he was
speaking a Filipino dialect (taga¬
log?) Nor could one tell when he
ceased to, to change to English, like
all the speakers did before him. The
poor fellow was giving his best, we
could tell that, but his selection by
our program-planners there was in¬
deed a very unhappy one. Before
we were switched to Manila, the
New York announcer gave our cap¬


ital, THE BEST BUILD-UP of the
day... not even one European coun¬
try got half as good a sales-talk as
that they used to boost Manila. The
talk was all about our fine build¬
ings, beautiful boulevards, our co¬
lossal piers, etc. AND THEN when
the listener is all worked up into
fever pitch by that sales-talk, and
just at that point when he expects
to hear something wonderful FROM


F. S. CAMON
MANILA, along comes one half-
lethargic voice blubbering some¬
thing nobody could understand. The
illusion goes ppppffft! like a
soap bubble! Spoiled!
Would it be asking too much, if
we expect of our program directors
and planners a little improvement
in the next chance we get to be on
a world-wide hook-up? It is only
natural that a Filipino should
speak English or any other lang¬
uage, with an accent that’s unavoid-


able, but speaking with an accent
is one thing and speaking unintel¬
igibly is another. And it’s not that
young man’s fault either, he did his
best and that was his best! But
why not somebody else who could
at least be understood? That’s what
station directors are drawing sala¬
ries for!
There was a time when we used
to be insulted and fighting mad be¬
cause some Americans would make
it a practice to photograph dingy
swamps, broken-down houses, thick
woods, bumpy gravel roads, half-
dressed mountaineers, etc, and then
sell the postcards all over the
world, thus giving the world at
large, a misleading idea of the true
civilized Philippines. Remember
that time? Well, now we are given
a chance to talk to the world by
radio... at last! a chance to give
the rest of the world a rough idea
of what we sound like and how well
we can master the English and
other languages. What do we do?
We go out and grab a young man
who is not very gifted as a speaker
and thrust him to the world to
isten to, as if to say: "Ladies and
gentlemen, The Philippines in Per¬
son! Listen to him!"
I was shaving as the announcer
started saying something about
Manila... I had to stop, to listen...
only to be puzzled about the whole
speech! The only thing I could
grasp was something about “93 de¬
grees Fahrenheit... from out of
his mumblings!

ARe WORM TURNING AGAIN.


Chinese students in North China demonstrating agains t the increase of Japanese troops in North China.


y S another Sino Japanese clash
in the making? From appear¬
ances, there is no other possi¬
ble conclusion than that China.
weak as she is, is planning to
block further Japanese aggression.
The strained Sino-Japanese re¬
lations in North China took a
serious turn when some 2,000
Chinese paraded in Tientsin city


streets and distributed handbills
assailing the Japanese last Thurs¬
day. The marchers protested
against smuggling of Japanese
goods in North China and decried
the unwarranted increase of the
Japanese garrisons at Peiping and
Tientsin.
Tientsin students- followed suit
that night when they declared


a 3-day strike and appealed to the
whele Chinese nation “to rise
against the Japanese invasion," in
telegrams rushed to all Chinese
educational institutions.
Japan, for the past three weeks,
kept pouring her troops into North
China, particularly in Tientsin and
the Great Wall passes along Pei¬
ping. Last May 16th, 7,000 new
arrivals bolstered Nippon’s garri¬
son man-power at Tientsin to
10,000.
Nanking protested, called Japan’s
attention to the Boxer protocol pro¬
hibiting increased troop movements.
But Japanese nationals must be pro¬
tected from Communist incursions,
replied the Tokyo war office, hence
the sending of fresh troops. Sub¬
sequently the same office forbade
officials from revealing the strength
of Nippon’s North China garrisons.
Last May 29th, transports again
landed 2,000 troops at Tangku.
As predicted by Kuomintang
party sympathizers, North China is
now at the brink of a new military
crisis, perhaps another swift thrust
—similar to the Manchurian incid¬
ent—to complete Nippon’s sover¬
eignty in that region. Quite alarm¬
ing is the near-completion of Jap¬
an’s “chemical plant" at her Tient-
sin concession. Also reels of barbed
wire were placed along that area,
ready to spread across the streets
and spin around buildings. The
Hopei airdrome has enough equip-
ment to service and repair 100
planes daily. And even Chinese
godowns, warehouses, and unused
public buildings in the city were
taken, cleaned, and altered for use


Trouble Between
China And Japan
Brewing Anew
of emergency Japanese troops.
These warlike preparations north
of the Yellow river caused Gene¬
ralissimo Chiang Kai-shek to mass
his troops along the south bank.
Whether Chiang’s actions meant a
challenge to Japanese up north or
preparation against invasion of
Chinese territory south of the Yel¬
low river, could not be ascertained.
Meanwhile, prospects of a Russo¬
Japanese war were increased due
to these troop movements. Control
of North China would provide Jap-
an with a base for the conquest of
Outer Mongolia. But Josef Stalin,
Russian dictator, friendly to Mon¬
gols, declared he would throw the
Russia war machine against Jap¬
an’s should Japanese invade Outer
Mongolia.
Viewed by the outside world, a
Sino-Japanese imbroglio is really
brewing. Near confirmation came,


The shooting of Japanese
Captain Shintaro Nakamura and
the blowing up of a bridge of
the Japanese-owned South Man¬
churia Railways, started the
war between Chinese and Japan¬
ese in Shanghai in 1932. Fight-
ing started on Jan. 20, 1932, and
continued until March 14th, with
Japanese troops reducing Shang¬
hai almost to ruins. Subsequent¬
ly, Japan attacked Manchuria,
wrested it from China and re-
named it Manchoukuo.


last week, when Major General H.
Tada, commander of the Japanese
north army in China, was replaced
by Lieut.-Gen. Kanichiro Tashiro.
Previous replacements in high com¬
mands always presaged new major
Japanese troop thrusts.
Meanwhile, Japanese militarists
created a sensation in Peiping
when Major General Takayoshi
Matsumuro established military
headquarters inside the legation
zone, not far from the American
legation. Officially, General Mat¬
sumuro will cooperate with General
Kanichiro Tashiro, North China
commander-in-chief. The Chinese,
however, believe that Matsumuro’s
chief duty will be to pave the way
for Henry Pu-yi’s return to Peiping
and occupy China’s dragon throne,
as ruler of North China and em¬
peror of Manchoukuo.

U. S. FILIPINO STUDENTS HAVE ORGANIZED
A DRIVE FOR A LOAN FUND FOR USE OF
INDIGENT BUT DESERVING STUDENTS

FrHE Filipino student in Amer¬
ica faces the future with
 dimming hope. Everywhere
in the nation his story is one of
hardship and privation. Once
proud but idealistic and ambitious,
he now humbly asks for assistance.
He is in sad plight, but serious in
his desire to make good, he is not
ashamed to tell the world about it.
Big Men Back Drive
So the Filipino Student Christian


Movement in America, which ope¬
rates under the supervision of the
Committee On Friendly Relations
Among Foreign Students is making
a drive to raise a substantial
amount for a student loan fund in
order to enable worthy students to
finish their college education.
The need for a student loan fund
is imperative. Americans high in
the councils of their country have
enlisted in this worthy cause.

and Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, pres¬
ident of Leland Standford Jr., Univ¬
ersity, and former secretary of the

Filipino students in institutions
of higher learning in Chicago and
vicinity have started the ball roll-
ing in this loan fund drive with the
presentation of a "Filipino Night”
at the International House in Chi¬
cago on April 18th. The proceeds
were intended to serve as the nu¬
cleus of the fund.
Appeal For Support
In his appeal for a sympathetic
understanding of the problems of
foreign students, Ernest B. Price,
director of the International House,
said, "With the world in its present


economic state, it has become in¬
creasingly difficult for foreign stu¬
dents to come to America for fur¬
ther education. Any move designed
to aid serious-minded students who
really need help to carry on their
study in America deserves general
and generous support. Even from
a purely selfish point of view, the
value to America of he ping the
youth of foreign lands to get ac¬
quainted with our life and institu¬
tions is inestimable. I heartily en¬
dorse the undertaking of the Fili¬
pino Student Christian Movement


Dr. Pablo V. Cabotaje: heads Filipino
Christian Mavement in America.


in America for raising a loan fund
for selected Filipino students.”
Charles D. Hurrey, general sec-
retary of the Committee on Friend¬
ly Relations Among Foreign Stu¬
dents, sounded the keynote in his
appeal to Fi ipinos. “There is no
more important service,” he wrote,
“to be rendered by Filipino students
than the adoption of a cooperative
program of mutual helpfulness.

A
Ahis BorIItORV MO
IS AN EDUCATION IN ITSELF
IF YOU CAN STICK IT OUT
2
By FELIPE F. PAULAR


TUDENTS may not realize it,
but a dormitory or a board¬
O ing house is an institution of
learning by itself. The experienc-
es one gathers while living in it
may at times be harrowing or even
grotesque but they serve to round
out the mass of information ga¬
thered in the college rooms. A
boarding house or dormitory resi¬
dent learns much of human na¬
ture: he realizes the world is not
made on'y for him, that he should
mold himself into his surround¬
ings.
The Dormitory Room
Most of the so-called dormitories
and boarding houses in the city
are located near schools and col¬
leges. In most instances the rooms
are bare. The ones recently va¬
cated, however, may look like veri¬
table pornographic museums: the
walls are pencilled with lewd
drawings, or are inartistical'y pa¬
pered with nude pictures cut from
magazines.
The floors are often dirty; most
owners do not care about the sa¬
nitary conditions in their build-
ings. The number of persons oc¬
cupying a room varies. Those who


prefer the lower rates are crowd¬
ed into a large room which looks
very small when the six or ten
boarders have been crammed in.
Those who can afford to pay more
are assigned to smaller rooms in
two’s or three’s. A boarder has no
choice in the kind of persons he
desires to room with. Anybody is
admitted by dormitory or boarding
house owners so long as he can
pay. It does not matter whether
he is a swindier or a crook.


No Strict Rules
There seems to be no strict en¬
forcement of rules and regulations
—if there are any at all—in dor¬
mitories. Dormitory owners have
learned that students want to be
“free.” And competition among
dormitories in the city is very keen.
To make the picture complete, a
great many students have not been
drilled in good manners and right
conduct in their homes. These are
exasperatingly inconsiderate, rude,
insoient, and even barbaric in their
ways. A dormitory is, according
to its etymology, a place where to
sleep. It is really a place where
to sleep—if you can.
The medley of noises in a dor¬
mitory must be heard to be appre¬
ciated. For instance, there is the
nasal voice of the lenow wno as¬
pires to become a crooner or who
has delusions of being one. Add
to this the throaty oflering of the
buading Demostnenes wno is bab¬
bung an impromptu oration, the
ciatter of hoonailed shoes and
bakla, the snore of those having
adenoids, and the shouts of those
who just can’t help shouting.
The Inconsiderate Ones
There are those who simply can-
not realize that the fel.ows next to
them are entitled to some rights
or considerations. In this group
is the physical culturist who, when
he exercises with his bar belis or
chest expanders, endangers the
lives and limbs of the otner occu¬
pants if they do not move out.
Then there is the singularly thrif-
ty individual who washes his
smelly underwear and hangs them
to dry on his bed next to yours.
You will also have to put up with
the individual who borrows or asks
for all sorts of things from you—
comb, pomade, paper, thread, nee¬
d.e, tooth paste, etc.—but seldom
ofiers what he has. Indeed, this
individual even keeps his unwant¬
ed bagoong and daing in his locker
or trunk. This pest is, however,
slightly better than the one who
appropriates his roommates’ things
without their permission. Some
students even take their relatives
to dormitories and let them stay
for several days in a room which
is already packed to the limit.
One must also learn to get along
with the bully who deliberately
scatters his things in the room so
he can hog more space than he is
entitled to.
The dormitory telephone is sup-


posed to be for the use of all the
residents. But try waiting for one
to stop as soon as he has started
ta king to his girl! Some do not
even know how to use the tele¬
phone, judging from the moisture
they leave in the mouthpiece.
The Question of Food
Eating conditions in most dormi¬
tories are far from fair. Service
of course depends upon the amount
which a resident pays. Oftentimes
clever boarders tip the boys or
cook in order to get better food or
service. This gives rise to discri¬
minations which force a boarder to
move from house to house. The
so-called "extras” which are sold
to those who are willing to pay the
price are but another way of pro¬
fiteering. Some students buy them
just to keep up their pretense that
they are above the rest. A great
many students deliberately delay
their payments when they are dis¬
criminated against or when the
food served is not good.
The Shrewd Casera
Sometimes a daughter or a niece
hangs around a boarding house as
a “bait.” It is considered an obli¬
gation for “pupilos" to entertain
the young thing by taking her to
shows, parties, picnics, etc. If
they fail to do so, they may be
discriminated against in service
and food even if they pay their
dues regularly and promptly. A
young man may, besides being

ing through lack of funds. Those
students who have completed their
work and desire to return home
should be given assistance. Stu¬
dents who are lacking a few dollars
with which to complete their work
in U. S. A, should 'ikewise receive
encouragement. I hope that the
Filipino Student Christian Move¬
ment in America may be successful
in its plans for a revolving loan
fund with which to meet the urgent
needs of Filipino students."
Mr. Hurrey is America’s unof-
ficial ambassador-at-large for, and
dean of, the foreign student popula¬
tion of the United States. As gen¬
eral secretary of the Committee on
Friend'y Relations, he has had close
contacts with students from all
parts of the known world. He vis¬
its them in university centers, coun¬
sels them, cheers them, gives mate¬
rial aid to those in distress, and
keeps them in touch with American
life at its best.
When asked
to the future of
the movement, Mr. Hurrey replied,
‘The answer lies with the Filipino
students. This is an undertaking
of Filipinos. There are rocks and
shoals confronting those who are
piloting this ship of adventure in
good-will and brotherhood but, as
every mariner knows, locating and
recognizing the obstacles are the
secrets of suc
na
on.
“The movement must
go on
the rocks of p
gy; it
must steer cle
als of
sectarianism an
oid
and bar
of racial prejuc

those who an

good ship will n
chor at any iso¬
lated is and but will keep an even
keel; its pass
s will maintain
a communication with voyages and
cruises of sin
movements but
will never lose sight of the desti¬
nation in whic
tual respect and
cooperation in
fish- Christian
cooperation prevail."
“It is not the lack of ambition
but the lack of means that is keep-


fleeced, get “hooked up” with the
daughter or niece of the casera
before he knows it.
Clever boarders, however, play
the game well. They insinuate
themselves into the good graces of
the casera by flirting with her
daughter or even with her. But
they are cautious during the
whole duration of the game, pre¬
pared not to be outsmarted.
Impecunious students actually
court their caseras or even their
lavanderas. There have been many
such illicit romances. Most of these
young men take to their heels
after finishing their courses, leav-
ing their benefactresses broke. But
many young men have proved not
smart enough to outsmart really
clever caseras and lavanderas.


ing Filipino students from the col¬
leges and universities," declared
Dr. Pablo V. Cabotaje, president
of the movement.
Fewer Filipino Students
In 1920 there were over 4,000
Filipino students in United States
institutions of higher learning.
They were the second largest for-
eign student group, only outnum¬
bered by Chinese students. It is
now estimated that there are less
than 1,000 actually in school.
The biggest number of Filipino


students are found in the Pacific
coast in such universities as Wash-
ington, Oregon, Ca ifornia (in both
the Los Angeles and Berkeley cam-
puses), Leland Standford, Jr., in
Palo Alto, and in the Rotky Moun¬
tain section, such as the University
of Colorado, Arizona, and Utah.
Minnesota has a large delegation of
Filipino students, also Wisconsin,
Illinois, Michigan, but in Chicago
with Northwestern, University of
Chicago, Loyola, De Paul, YMCA
Co lege, and various others, Filipi¬
nos cutnumber all other foreign


student groups
The movement has its headquar¬
ters in New York City and is ad¬
ministered by the Committee on
Friendly Relations Among Foreign
Students in America through the
Philippine Division, under the di¬
rection of a Filipino general secret¬
ary. The secretary, once a year,
makes a visit to all the universities
where there are Filipino students,
and the hardships he found prevail-
ing among Filipino students neces¬
sitates the loan fund movement.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE
The death of Harold Mankhause, a London
Invalid, has been the subject of an inquest
at which is determined that the dead man
was willfully murdered through poisoning by
some person or persans unknawn. A search
of the Mankhouse residence follows. A bot¬
tle which the police officers helieve had con¬
tained paison is lound in the library which
is under the care of Wallingford, the dead
man's secretary. Anather such hottle is
lound in Madeline Narris' room. Nothing is
lound in Mrs. Mankhouse's chamher or in
the servants’ quartera.
Rupert Mayfield, friend of the Mankhouse
lamily, hires Dr. Thorndyke, famed medico¬
legal expert, to conduct an investigation in
dependent of that nf the police. Dr. Thorn¬
dyke hesitates to accept, saying that as in¬
vestigator he is under obligation to expose
all the lacts which may prove the undoing
ol one or more persons intimately connect-
ed with the Monkhouse household: Mrs
Monkhause, Madeline Norris. Wallingford,
Mahel Withers (the hausemaid), the caok,
he kitchen maid, Dr. Dimsdale (family phy-
sician), and Mayfield. Mayfield insists that
Dr. Thorndyke investigate.

is why I am anxious that
the actual perpetrator
should be discovered. Until he is,
all these people will be under sus¬
picion, with the peril of a possible
arrest constant'y hanging over
them. I might even say 'hanging
over us” for you, yourself, have in¬
cluded me in the group of possible
suspects.”
He reflected for a few moments.
At length he replied:
“You are quite right, Mayfield.
Until the perpetrator of a crime is
discovered and his guilt established,
it is always possible for suspicion
to rest upon the innocent and even
for a miscarriage of justice to oc¬
cur In all cases it is most desir¬
able that the crime should be
brought home to the actual perpet¬
rator without delay for that reason,
to say nothing of the importance,
n grounds of public policy, of ex¬
posing and punishing wrong-doers.
You know these people and' do not.
If you are sufficiently confident of
their innocence to take the risk of
associating yourself with the agen¬
cies of detection, I have no more to
say on that point. I am quite will¬
ing to go into the case so far as I
can, though, at present, I see no
prospect of success."
“It seems to you a difficult case,
then?"
"Very. It 7s extraordinarily


obscure and confused. Whoever
poisoned that unfortunate man,
seems to have managed most skil¬
fully to confuse all the issues.
Whatever may have been the me¬
dium through which the poison was
given, that medium is associated
equally with a number of different
ersons. If the medicine was the
vehicle, then the responsibility is
divided between Dimsdale, who
prepared it, and the various per¬
sons who administered it. If the
poison was mixed with the food, it
may have been introduced by any
of the persons who prepared it or
had access to it on its passage from
the kitchen to the patient’s bed-
room. There is no one person of
whom we can say that he or she
had any special opportunity that
others had not. And it is the same
with the motive. No one had any
really adequate motive for killing
Monkhouse; but all the possible
suspects benefited by his death,
though they were apparently not
aware of it."
“They all knew in general terms,
that they had been mentioned in
he will though the actual provi¬
sions and amounts were not dis¬
closed. But I should hardly des¬
cribe Mrs. Monkhouse as benefit-
ing by her husband’s death. She
will not be as well off now as she


was when he was alive and the
vhole of his income was available.
“No. But we were not including
her in the group since she was not
in the house when the poison was
being administered. We were speak¬
ing of those who actual'y had the
opportunity to administer the pois¬
on; and we see that the opportun¬
ity was approximately equal in all.
And you see, Mayfield, the trouble
is that any evidence incriminating
any one person would be in events
which are past and beyond recall
The depositions contain all that we
know and all that we are likely to
know, unless the police are able
to ascertain that some one of
the parties has purchased arsen¬
ic from a chemist; which is ex¬
tremely unlikely considering the
caution and judgment that the pois¬
oner has shown. The truth is that
if no new evidence is forthcoming
he murder of Harold Monkhouse
will take its place among the un¬
solved and insolub e mysteries.”
“Then, I take it that you will en¬
deavour to find some new evidence?
But I don’t see, at all, how you will
go about it."
“Nor do I,” said he. “There
seems to be nothing to investigate.
However, I shall study the deposi¬
tions and see if a careful consider¬
ation of the evidence offers any


suggestion for a new line of re¬
search. And as the whole case now
lies in the past, I sha’l try to learn
as much as possible about everything
and everybody concerned. Perhaps
I had better begin with you. I
lon’t quite understand what your
position is in this household.”
"I will tell you with pleasure all
about my relations with the Monk-
houses, but it is a rather long story
and I don’t see that it will help you
in any way.”
“Now Mayfield," said Thorn¬
dyke, “don’t begin by considering
wvhat knowledge may or may not be
helpful. We don’t know. The
most trivial or seemingly irrelev¬
ant fact may offer a most ilumin¬
ating suggestion. My rule is, when
I am gravelled for lack of evidence,
to collect, indiscriminately all the
information that I can obtain that
is in the remotest way connected
with the problem that I am dealing.
with. Bear that in mind. I want
to know all that you can tell me,
and don’t be afraid of irrelevant
details. They may not be irrelev¬
ant, after all; and if they are, l
can sift them out afterwards. Now,
begin at the beginning and tell me
the whole of the long story.”
He provided himself with a note¬
book, uncapped his fountain pen
and prepared himself to listen to
what I felt to be a perfectly useless
recital of facts that could have no
possible bearing on the case.
“I will take you at your word,”
said I, "and begin at the very be¬
ginning, when I was quite a small

Not many months ago, children

the tendency to create disrespect
for law enforcement. To-day, they
are playing G-men and policemen.

The custom of hurling rice and
old shoes at the departing newly¬
weds is one of the oldest. Rice or
other grain in prehistoric times
was the symbol for man. Sandals
were the symbol for woman. The
ancient wish expressed by the
guests at a wedding in a shower of
rice and old shoes is that the mar-
riage shall be fruitful. Probably
as old as the bombardment of rice
and wornout footwear is the em-
ployment of the wedding ring. It
came about when ancient man con¬
ceived that a cord tied about a
woman’s waist formed an exit
through which her spirit could
pass into the body of the man.
From waist cord to ring was a sim¬
ple step.—From Chicago Sunday
Tribune.
It's fun throwing P0.36-a-ganta
rice at them, but newlyweds now
are afraid of raising a string of
toddling children. More dance par¬

"Making a husband out of a man
is one of the highest arts known
to civilization. It requires science,
hope and charity, especially chari¬

him. If you permit him to make
love to you he gets tired of you in
the end, and if you don’t he gets
tired of you in the beginning.

you are a cynic, and if you do, he
thinks you are a fool. If you are
a clinging vine type, he doubts you
have a heart, and if you are silly,
he longs for a bright mate, and if
you are brilliant, he longs for a
playmate. If you are popular he
is jealous, and if you are not, he
hesitates to marry a wall-flower.

The daintiness of true cieanliness


The daintiness and charm of a fas¬
tidiously groomed woman does not
come by chance. It arises from
attention to the little derails of the

EXCLUSIVE SPARK OF
LIFE IS ELECTRICAL
SAYS FAMOUS SURGEON
Is electricity the basis of life?
Dr. George Crile, famous surgeon
and a founder of the Cleveland
Clinic, in his recent book, “The
Phenomena of Life, puts forward
the theory that electricity is the
elusive spark of life. He believes
our bodies are made up of cells
which are really minute but
powerful electric furnaces or
“radiogens.” Scientists generally
have not accepted Dr. Crile’s
theory and a test would require
collaboration of investigators in
many fields of science. Briefly,
Dr. Crile’s theory is that oxidation
produces radiant energy, radiant
energy generates electric cur¬
rents in protoplasm, electricity is
the energy that governs the acti¬
vity of protoplasm, the normal and
pathological phenomena of life are
manifestations of pro toplasm,
therefore the phenomena of life
must be due to the radiant and
e ectrical energy. Dr. Crile be¬
lieves the liver, brain and adrenal
glands "provide the clue to the
electrical energy. Dr. Crile be¬
mediately governs life, the failure
of which causes death.” He de¬
fines protoplasm as "a system of
generators, conductance lines, in¬
sulators and infinite numbers of
infinitely thin films to hold elec¬
tric charges."

M N 1934, the Sakdalistas of La¬
guna campaigned assiduously
 against the re-election of Rep.
Arsenio Bonifacio and succeeded in
defeating the young, Laguna solon
at the polls. But when the same
radical followers of Benigno Ramos
found themselves in the toils of the
aw after the bloody Cabuyao en¬
counter of May last year, it was
Bonifacio who acted as their coun¬
sel.
Then, in the elections of 1935,
when Bonifacio campaigned to re-
gain his lost seat in the legisla¬
ture, the communists of the pro¬
vince (led by the wily Asedillo)
worked against him. After an un¬
successful attempt at banditry,
and after the death of their leader,
the communists were charged of
sedition. Again, it was Bonifacio
who worked to provide these poor,
misguided followers of Asedillo
with proper counsel.
One may see nothing remarkable
in Bonifacio’s readiness to extend
his help to those in need. Further-
more, one is apt to remark that it
is a part of the game of politics
and he has to play it. And yet, one
has to know him fully to under¬
stand his ardent solicitude for the
people whom he loves with sincer-
ity.
Assemblyman Bonifacio was born
in Santa Cruz, Laguna, on Decem¬
ber 14, 1893. He is the son of
Marcelo Bonifacio, a capitan muni¬
cipal during the Spanish time, and
Luciana Limcuando.
He studied first in the public
schools of his town, and later
transferred to the Laguna High
School. During his student days,
teaching was regarded as the best
career for every young man who
could not afford to go to college.
Attracted by the teaching profes¬
sion, Bonifacio went to Manila in
1909 and studied in the Philippine
Normal School.
The Philippine Normal School
was reorganized when he was in
his second year and some of the
classes, including his, were taken
over by the newly established col¬
lege of liberal arts, University of
the Philippines. He was awarded
his A.B. degree in 1915 with ho¬
nors. He then transferred to the
college of law of the same institu¬
tion and was to have graduated in
1919 were it not for an incident
which is now worth relating. Bo¬
nifacio was under Dean Bocobo in
civil law and, as a working student
with no time to study his lessons
and no money with which to buy
books, he made a poor showing in
his class. However, he never
flunked in his tests as he studied
when examinations were approach-
ing. Dean Bocobo nevertheless
did not think he deserved to pass


and flunked him in civil law. Al¬
though he obtained high ratings
in other subjects, he was not al¬
lowed to graduate by Dean Bocobo.
Taking advantage of a ruling
(no longer existing) which allowed
all those who have taken the re¬
gular four-year law course in any
reputable law school to take the
bar examinations, Bonifacio filed
his application with the Supreme
Court in 1918. The application
wvas approved and he took the bar
examinations together with his
classmates. The result of that ex¬
amination proved to be a surprise
to Dean Bocobo. Bonifacio, whom
he flunked in civil law, obtained
100%, the highest rating obtained
by any candidate that year, in ci¬
vil law. More than that, Bonifacio,
to whom the college of law refused
to grant a diploma, came out No.
3 in the list of successful candi¬
dates. Alejo Labrador, now judge
of the court of first instance, ob¬
tained the first place.
Assemblyman Bonifacio was a
self-supporting young man during
his student days. Even while he
was still in the college of liberal
arts, he started looking for a job.
He found one, as student assistant
n the department of zoology. As
such, he earned the small amount
of P.20 an hour. Shortly after¬
wards, he became a member of the
reportorial staff of the Bulletin,
sports department. For two years,
he was a teacher, first in the Ton-
do Primary School and later in the
Tondo Intermediate School. An
order of the director of education
prohibiting public school teachers
from studying law, however, made
Bonifacio resign from his teaching
job. He became a teacher at the Co¬
legio de Nuestra Sra. del Rosario
and was given a salary of ₱10 a
month, plus board and lodging.
The salary was not even enough to
make both ends meet, so he took
the civil service examination, and
passed with high rating. He was
later employed as clerk in the con¬
sulting architects office, bureau of
public works.
In 1925, he was designated depu¬
ty fiscal in the province of Lagu¬
na. He served as such for three
years. In 1928, Bonifacio present¬
ed his candidacy for the house of
representatives in the second dis¬
trict of Laguna, and defeated a ve¬
teran politician, ex-Rep. Aurelio
Palileo, with a majority of over
2,000 votes. In 1931, after a very
successful term, his candidacy
was again launched by his leaders.
For the second time, he won with
a big majority.
He presented his candidacy for
re-election in the 1934 elections
under the banner of the pros and
was defeated in the big Sakdal
landslide of that year, by Sakda¬


lista Mariano Untivero. Last year,
he ran for a seat in the first Na¬
tional Assembly under the Com-
monwealth and won.
He is a member of the commit¬
tees on public service, impeaching,
public works, and public instruc¬

Assemblyman Bonifacio was
"Kataastaasang Diwa” of the Pa¬
lihan Ng Bayan, a large organiza¬
tion composed mostly of farmers
and laborers, and was one of the
organizers. Because of the attempt
of certain officials of the organi¬

recently resigned from his post.
He is married to the former Miss

Angel Limjuco, of Lian, Batan¬
gas, is a farmer. Like many others,
he was encouraged by the govern-
ment to plant cotton in his farm.
"We have a cotton gin and we can


buy your farm produce," plant in¬
dustry officials assured him.
Limjuco tried planting, cotton
last year He invested a big sum
of money but because it was his
first attempt, he failed.
This year, after learning a few
“tricks,” he came to the bureau of
plant industry and a little excited¬
ly gave out the glad tidings that
he had succeeded. He has an ex¬
ce’lent crop. "Will you buy my
cotton?” Limjuco asked.
Very gravely, bureau of plant in¬
dustry officials answered: “We are
sorry. Our cotton gin is already
closed. Malacanang gave the or¬
der only two weeks ago.”
And Limjuco, after spending
thousands of pesos on his cotton
farm, will, have to leave his cotton
unpicked.

FaVHERE are times everyday
kitchen routine becomes so
monotonous no matter how
easy we try to take them. This
casual monotony can only be bro¬
ken by working on something new
and interesting. And this you will
find in the cooking of sweet dishes.
An afternoon devoted to them
would be very good for a change;
and even the children will get in-
terested to help in the cooking—
not only in the eating, this time.

Beauty Program
for the Busy Lady


w T does happen sometimes, that
you can afford to have just
one afternoon a week all to
yourself. You must then, in the
name of love-iness, set it aside for
beauty short-cuts.
Skin Treatment
Prepare your hair for shampoo¬
ing—apply carefully olive-oil to the
scalp an hour before washing. That
prevents dandruff and maintains
the .ustre of the hair. Plunge for
a leisurely bath with a thick coat
of cream on your face while in the
tub. As soon as you are out of the
water, remove the cream; follow
with a pat of face lotion and dry.
You are then ready for general
skin-toning.
And this is where the mask
comes in. There is quite a variety
of them, but for practical purposes,
use the most available. Right now,


when gardens and markets are full
of cucumbers, the cucumber mask
is a good one to try. Simply re¬
move the green skin, in thick strips,
from a large cucumber, put the
strips in a bowl of water and allow
to stand overnight in a cold place.
Next day, after cleaning your
skin thoroughly, preferably with
cleansing cream, soak a large cot¬
ton pad in the cucumber water and
pat your skin with it. Then, put
the strips of cucumber rind across
and around your face and throat,
covering them with the moist cot-
ton pad. Lie down for twenty min¬
utes and rinse the skin several
times with cold water as soon as
you get up. Pat on some skin to¬
nic; let it dry. Now you’re ready
for foundation lotion and make¬
up.
Now start brushing the hair. If
you have a tonic to correct a special
scalp condition, massage it before
you start to use the brush. Keep
on brushing for about fifteen min¬
utes. And don’t forget the eyes¬
a dropper-full of eyewash as boric
acid solution (296) kept in a cool
place is recommended by the doc¬
tor.
On week days, when you have
just enough time to snatch a pick¬
up lunch and to fluff a pinch of
good powder: Also try to steal a
few extra minutes for a little re¬
laxation, a good breathing spell be¬
fore taking your meal, airing for
your hair, and skin freshening of
some kind.
A regu’ar fifteen minutes nap
after lunch is a way of the young
in mind and body. The hair must
be given an airing to prevent it
from falling off. Skin-freshening
with water, bland soap,, and face
lotion will keep the pores from clog¬
ging up—which if overlooked, re¬
sults in some kind of skin-blemish
or another. Don’t allow more than
one old and new layer of powder to
stay on your face, especially if your
skin is sensitive and delicate.
Exercises
But don’t forget—besides your
face, there is your figure to be
taken care of. Follow your beauty
sleep with a set of simple exercises.


They will not take much of your
time, and are worth the little trou¬
ble of doing them. For back-
straightening try this one:
Lie flat on the foor with knees
pulled up, weight of the legs rest-
ing on the balls of the feet, weight
of the body resting in the center
of the backbone. Flatten the spin-
al column, except the last two ver¬
tebrae, against the floor. Those
last two vertebrae should be turned
upward. Holding that position
(it’s quite comfortab'e after the
first few minutes), raise the arms
from the sides until they are
stretched high above your head. In¬
hale as you raise them and pull the
stomach up and in. Move the arms
back to the sides, exhaling slowly.
Repeat several times, keeping the
backbone pressed against the floor.
If your position is correct, there
will be no hollow in the center of
your neck. Try to maintain that
position when you get up and walk
around the room.
Exercise No. 2: Stretch out your
fingers away from each other and


back, as if you were pressing the
front part of your finger tips
against a wa’l behind you. Then
straighten your arm, and send the
stiff and open hands and stiff arms
and the shoulders, up and back and
down almost as you instinctively do
when you yawn, but with the lips
closed. Hold the extended position
for a few seconds.
* *


Your Hoir
and its core


The warmerthe weather the more of-
ten you must shompoo your hair. Yet
too frequent shompoos rob it of its
luster, bring on dry scalp and thin-
ning hair. Before every shampoo ap¬
ply Vaseline Hair Tonic to the scalp
and massage thoroughly. Allow the
Tonic to remain on the scalp ond
hair overnight and shampoo next
morning. Such treotments stimulote
the circulotion of the scalp, keep
it in a healthy condition, and make
the hair soft
 end lbareur.

Smells Fishy
I smell something fishy in the
fact that Arithmetic was not in-
cluded among the subjects in the
examination for Editor (assistant
chief, Department of Agricu’ture
and Commerce) given by the civil
service recently. I understand that,
besides the inclusion of Arithmetic
during the examination for editor
given three years ago, the exper¬
ience requirement was five years
along newspaper work. The recent
examination required two years ex¬
perience along “the duties of an
editor."
Why the subjects and experience
requirements were modified I can¬
not explain, except maybe that the
examination was given to qualify
somebody already occupying the
post.

Lauds Press Campaign
In your issue of April 30th, the
article “Stay Home, Girls,” inte¬

article I read in another paper, I
make the conclusion that the press
means business in their campaign
against purveyors of human flesh.
But I regret that until now our
authorities are apparently not in¬

Rupert Brooke tied for second place in our recent symposium on the
favorite writers of local authors. We have already published some of his
best sonnets. Here’s another of his poems.
Day That I Have Loved
TENDERLY, day that I have loved, I close your eyes,
And smooth your quiet brow, and fold your thin dead hands.
The grey veils of the half-light deepen; colour dies.
I bear you, a light burden, to the shrouded sands,
Where lies your waiting boat, by wreaths of the sea’s making
Mist garlanded, with all grey weeds of the water crowned.
There you’ll be laid, past fear of sleep or hope of waking;
And over the unmoving sea, without a sound,
Faint hands will row you outward, out beyond our sight,
Us with stretched arms and empty eyes on the far-gleaming
And marble sand....
Beyond the shifting cold twilight,
Further than laughter goes, or tears, further than dreaming,
There'll be no port, no dawn-lit islands! But the drear
Waste darkening, and, at length, flame ultimate on the deep.
Oh, the last fire—and you, unkissed, unfriended there!
Oh, the lone way’s red ending, and we not there to weep!
(We found you pale and quiet, and strangely crowned with
flowers,
Lovely and secret as a child. You came with us,
Came happily, hand in hand with the young dancing hours,
High on the downs at dawn!) Void now and tenebrous,
The grey sands curve before me....
From the inland meadows,
Fragrant of June and clover, floats the dark, and fills
The hollow sea’s dead face with little creeping shadows,
And the white silence brims the hollow of the hills.
Close in the nest is folded every weary wing,
Hushed all the joyful voices; and we, who held you dear,
Eastward we turn and homeward, alone, remembering....
Day that I loved, day that I loved, the Night is here!
-Rubert Brooke

Wants Police Nationalized
Recently one provincial governor
fearlessly denounced the police sys¬
tem in his province. He said the
townspeople there have lost their
faith in policemen and that, even
for small troubles, they go to the
constabulary for help or protection.
If this be true, then there must
be something wrong with the local
police administration, partly due
perhaps to methods of appointment
and, possibly, in its defective or¬
ganization and insufficient disci¬
pline.
For efficiency, I would therefore
favor nationalization of our police
system. Thus only could our po¬
lice forces be freed from the influ¬
ence of politics, and render effec¬
tive protection.

Mr. A. Napoleon Marasigan’s

submitted about the women of Ma¬

just presentation of his comments.
I had no vain desire to see my

wanted to bring the bare facts, out,
which I did. Modesty aside, I had
been writing under pseudonyms un¬
til the editor of a weekly advised
me wisely to sign my true name
to my contributions.
Regarding the Makato news item,
I can say that I investigated the
situation on the spot itself. And

years old. Unfortunately, Mrs.
Keene was very delicate, and soon
after the child’s birth she dev-
eloped symptoms of consumption.
Once started, the disease progressed
rapidly in spite of the most care¬
ful treatment, and in about two
years from the outset of the symp-
toms, she died.
“Her death was a great grief to
Mr. Keene, and indeed, to us all,
for she was a most lovable woman;
and the poor little motherless child
made the strongest appeal to our
sympathies. She was the loveliest
little creature imaginable and as
sweet and winning in nature as she
was charming in appearance. On
her mother’s death, I adopted her
as my little sister, and devoted my¬
self to her service. In fact, I be¬
came her slave; but a very willing
slave; for she was so quick and in¬
telligent, so affectionate and so
amiable that, in spite of the differ-
ence in our ages—some eight or
nine years—I found her a perfectly
satisfying companion. She entered
quite competently into all my boy¬
ish sports and amusements, so that
our companionship really involved
very little sacrifice on my part but
rather was a source of constant
pleasure.
“But her motherless condition
caused Mr. Keene a good deal of
anxiety. As I have said, he was
getting on in life and was by no
means a strong man, and he viewed
with some alarm the, not very re¬
mote, possibility of her becoming
an orphan with no suitable guard¬
ian, for my father was now an el¬
derly man, and I was, as yet, too
young to undertake the charge.
Eventually, he decided, for the
child’s sake, to marry again; and
about two years after his first
wife’s death he proposed to and
was accepted by a lady named Ains¬
worth whom he had known for
many years, who had been left a
widow with one child, a girl some
two years younger than myself.
“Naturally, I viewed the advent
of the new Mrs. Keene with some
jealousy. But there was no occa¬
sion. She was a good, kindly wo¬
man who showed from the first
that she meant to do her duty by
her little stepdaughter. And her
own child, Barbara, equally dis¬
armed our jealousy. A quiet, rather
reserved little girl, but very clever
and quick-witted, she not only ac¬
cepted me at once with frankest
friendliness but, with a curious tact-
fulness for such a young girl, de¬
voted herself to my little friend,
Stella Keene, without in the least
attempting to oust me from my
position. In effect, we three young
people became a most united and
harmonious little coterie in which
our respective positions were duly
recognized. I was the head of the
firm, so to speak, Stella was my
adopted sister, and Barbara was
the ally of us both.
“So our relations continued as
the years passed; but presently the
passing years began to take toll of


our seniors. My father was the
first-to go. Then followed Mr.
Keene, and after a few more years,
Barbara’s mother. By the time my
twenty-fifth birthday came round,
we were all orphans."
“What were your respective ages
then?” Thorndyke asked.
Rather surprised at the question,
I paused to make a calculation.
My own age,” I replied, "was,
as I have said, twenty-five. Bar¬
bara would then be twenty-two and
Stella sixteen.
Thorndyke made a note of my an¬
swer and I proceeded:
“The death of our elders made no
appreciable difference in our way
of living. My father had left me
a modest competence and the two
girls were fairly provided for. The
houses that we occupied were be¬
yond our needs, reduced as we were
in numbers and we discussed the
question of sharing a house. But,
of course, the girls were not really
my sisters and the scheme was
eventually rejected as rather too
inconventional; so we continued to
live in our respective houses."
“Was there any trustee for the
girls?” Thorndyke asked.
“Yes, Mr. Brodribb. The bulk
of the property was, I believe,
vested in Stella, but, for reasons
which I shall come to in a moment,
there was a provision that, in the
event of her death, it should revert
to Barbara.”
“On account, I presume, of the
tendency to consumption?”
“Exactly. For some time before
Mr. Keene’s death there had been
signs that Stella inherited her
mother’s delicacy of health. Hence
the provisions for Barbara. But
no definite manisfestations of di¬
sease appeared until Stella was
about eighteen. Then she developed
a cough and began to lose weight;
but, for a couple of years the di¬
sease made no very marked pro¬
gress, in fact, there were times
when she seemed to be in a fair
wvay to recovery. Then, rather sud-
lenly, her health took a turn for
the worse. Soon she became al¬
most completely bed-ridden. She
wasted rapidly, and, in fact, was
now the typical consumptive, hectic,
emaciated, but always bright,
cheerful and full of plans for the
future and enthusiasm for the lit¬
tle hobbies that I devised to keep
her amused.
“But all the time, she was going
down the hill steadily, although, as
I have said, there were remissions
and fluctuations; and, in short,
after about a year’s definite illness,
she went the way of her mother.
Her death was immediately caused,
I understand, by an attack of
hemorrhage.”
“You understand?” Thorndyke
repeated, interrogatively.
“Yes.
To my lasting grief, I
was away from home when she
died. I had been recently called to
the bar and was offered a brief for
the Chelmsford Assizes, which I
felt I ought not to refuse, especially
as Stella seemed, just then, to be

QUESTIONS:—What relation has
the black widow spider with that
one found in Coron, Palawan? It
is as poisonous as the former? The
hind part of the body is red. It
can kill carabaos, cows, and other
big animals by its bite. Why is it
that most animals which are pois¬
onous have red signals in their bo¬
dies, like the poisonous wasp and
the poisonous short snake called
ogto-ogto in this locality?—Luis P.
Romasanta, P. O. Box 76, Iloilo,
Iloilo.
ANSWERS:—Judging from
your statement that the hind part
of the body is red, it is most like¬
ly the same spider as those found
in Cebu or Negros. However, if
you will furnish us with a few
spiders (preserved in alcohol)
from Coron, Palawan, we will be
in a position to tell definitely whe¬
ther it is the true black widow
spider.
We do not know of any explana¬
tion why most animals which are
poisonous have red spots in the
body. We know, however, that
color or color patterns in insects
is developed in connection with a
muscle, and marks the point of at¬
tachment of the fiber to the cuti¬
cula.—Answered by Fidel del Ro¬
sario, entomologist, National Mu¬
seum Division, bureau of science,
Manila.

QUESTIONS:—Is there any law
in the Philippines for the compul¬
sory registration of individual
stores in the bureau of commerce?
Are stores owned by two or more


persons under common agreement
to run a business required to reg¬
ister in the said bureau?—Jose L.
Lorenzo, Tuguegarao, Cagayan.
ANSWERS:—Act No. 3883, as
amended by Act No. 4147, pro¬
vides for the compulsory regis¬
tration in this office, of all busi¬
ness names announced on sign¬
boards exhibited in or outside the
place where the business is con¬
ducted, such as for example,
"ORIENTAL BAZAR,” “CHICA¬
GO HOTEL AND RESTAUR-
ANT," or other similar names.
However, names of business alone,
although announced on sig n¬
boards, such as “GENERAL
MERCHANDISE STORE" "PAN¬
CITERIA AND RESTAURANT”
or other similar names are not
subject to registration under the
said act.
A store owned by two or more
persons under common agreement
to run a business is not required
to register in this office unless it
announces a business name on a
signboard. They may register the
radename of the business under
Act. No. 666 but such registra¬
tion is not compulsory.—Answer¬
ed by Celedonio Agrava, chief
trade regulation division, bureau
of commerce, Manila.
QUESTIONS:—What is the to¬
tal official report of registrants for
military training in the whole
Philippines? How many registrants
will undergo military training for
five and a half months?—Lupo de
Peralta, Puro, Caoayan, Ilocos Sur.


ANSWERS:—The total regis-
trants for military training in the
whole Philippines is 144,000. 20,-
000 young men are the first
bunch to undergo military train¬
ing for five and a half months.

better than usual. What made it
worse was that the telegram which
was sent to recall me went astray.
I had moved on to Ipswich and had
only just written to give my new
address, so that I did not get home
until just before the funeral. It was
a fearful shock, for no one had the
least suspicion that the end was so
near. If I had supposed that there
was the slightest immediate danger,
nothing on earth would have in¬
duced me to go away from home."
Thorndyke had listened to my
story not only with close attention
but with an expression of sympa¬
thy which I noted gratefully and
berhaps with a little surprise. But
he was a strange man; as imper¬
sonal as Fate when he was occupied
in actual rescarch and yet showing
at times unexpected gleams of warm
human feeling and the most sym-
pathetie understanding. He now
preserved a thoughtful silence for
some time after I had finished.
Presently he said:
“I suppose this poor girl’s death
caused a considerable change in
your way of living?”
“Yes, indeed! Its effects were de¬
vasting both on Barbara and me.
Neither of us felt that we could go
on with the old ways of life. Bar¬
bara let her house and went into
rooms in London, where I used to
visit her as often as I could; and
I sold my house, furniture and all
and took up residence in the Tem-
ple. But even that I could not en¬
dure for long. Stella’s death had
broken me up completely. Right
on from my boyhood, she had been
the very hub of my life. All my
thoughts and interests had revolved
around her. She had been to me
friend and sister in one. Now
that she was gone, the world seemed
to be a great, chilly void, haunted
everywhere by memories of her.
She had pervaded my whole life,
and everything about me was con¬
stantly reminding me of her. At
last I found that I could bear it no
longer. The familiar things and
places became intolerable to my
eyes. I did not want to forget her;
on the contrary, I loved to cherish
her memory. But it was harrow¬
ing to have my loss thrust upon
me at every turn. I yearned for
new surroundings in which I could
begin a new life; and in the end,
I decided to go to Canada and set¬
tle down there to practise at the
Bar.
“My decision came as a fearful
blow to Barbara, and indeed, I felt
not a little ashamed of my dis¬
loyalty to her; for she, too, had
been like a sister to me and, next
to Stella, had been my dearest


friend. But it could not be helped.
An intolerable unrest had posses¬
sion of me. I felt that I must go;
and go I did, leaving poor Barbara
to console her loneliness with her
political friends.
“I stayed in Canada nearly two
years and meant to stay there for
good. Then, one day, I got a let¬
ter from Barbara telling me that
she was married. The news rather
surprised me, for I had taken Bar¬
bara for an inveterate spinster
with a tendency to avoid male
friends other than myself. But
the news had another, rather cur¬
ious effect. It set my thoughts
rambling amidst the old surround¬
ings. And now I found that they
repelled me no longer; that, on the
contrary, they aroused a certain
feeling of home-sickness, a yearn¬
ing for the fuller, richer life of
London and a sight of the English
countryside. In not much more
than a month, I had wound up my
Canadian affairs and was back in
my old chambers in the Temple,
which I had never given up, ready
to start practice afresh.”
“That," said Thorndyke, "would
be a little less than three years ago.
Now we come to your relations with
the Monkhouse establishment."
“Yes; and I drifted into them
almost at once. Barbara received
me with open arms, and of course,
Monkhouse knew all about me and
accepted me as an old friend. Very
soon I found myself, in a way, a
member of the household. A bed¬
room was set apart for my use,
whenever I cared to occupy it, and
I came and went as if I were one
of the family. I was appointed
a trustee, with Brodribb, and
dropped into the position of gen¬
eral family counsellor."
“And what were your relations
with Monkhouse?”
“We were never very intimate.
I liked the man and I think he liked
me. But he was not very approach-
able; a self-contained, aloof, unde¬
monstrative man, and an inveterate
book-worm. But he was a good
man and I respected him profound-
ly, though I could never understand
why Barbara married him, or why
he married Barbara. I couldn’t
imagine him in love. On the other
hand I cannot conceive any motive
that any one could have had for do¬
ing him any harm. He seemed to
me to be universally liked in a
rather lukewarm fashion."
“It is of no use, I suppose," said
Thorndyke, "to ask you if these re-
miniscences have brought anything
to your mind that would throw
any light on the means, the motive

QUESTIONS:—Three months ago
red blotches appeared on my face.
They disappeared. Then they appear¬
ed again. Is this a symptom of le¬
prosy? What are the causes? Does
the appearance signify I have this
sickness? What are its other symp-
toms? What must be the foods a pa¬
tient should take? What medicine
could you prescribe? How many
months does it take the ailment to
reach its acute stage?—A GRA-
PHIC reader, Ilagan, Isabela.
ANSWER:—With the symptoms
mentioned here, it is impossi¬
ble to establish a diagnosis of
leprosy, hence, it will be unneces¬
sary to answer the other ques¬
tions. It is suggested that the
case be brought to a dermato¬
logist for proper diagnosis.—An¬
swered by Dr. Jacobo Fajardo, di¬
rector of health, Manila.

QUESTION:—I have had colitis
for almost two years. Kindly
please tell me what food I should
eat.—An Inquirer, Manila.
ANSWER:—The arrangement of
the diet in colitis is difficult be¬
cause not all persons find the
same food suitable, and also be¬
cause the disease may be long
standing, and food should be ade¬
quate in amount and its supply of
nutritive essentials. The general
principle of the diet is that the


of the person connected with the
crime?”
“No,” I answered; "nor can I
imagine that they will bring any¬
thing to yours. In fact, I am as¬
tonished that you have let me go on
so long dribbling out all these tri¬
vial and irrelevant details. Your
patience is monumental."
“Your
“Not at all,” he replied.
story has interested me deeply. It
enables me to visualize very clearly
at least a part of the setting of this
crime, and it has introduced me to
the personalities of some of the
principal actors, including your¬
self. The details are not in the
least trivial; and whether they are
r are not irrelevant we cannot
judge. Perhaps, when we have
solved the mystery—if ever we do
—we may find connections between
events that had semed to be totally
unrelated.”
“It is, I suppose, conceivable as
a mere, speculative possibility. But
what I have been telling you is
mainly concerned with my own
rather remote past, which can
hardly have any possible bearing
on comparatively recent events.”
“That is perfectly true,” Thorn-
dyke agreed. “Your little auto¬
biography has made perfectly clear
your own relation to these people,
but it has left most of them—and
those in whom I am most interested
—outside the picture I was just


food be bland and smooth, with
little digestive residue. Milk
(sometimes boiled is more effec-
tive) forms the basis. To make up
for lack of salad vegetables and
fresh fruits one should take orange
juice, tomato juice, brewer’s yeast
and carrot juice. Avocados, if
available, fill the need for fresh
food. Because of the lack of bulky
foods as found in the normal diet,
one may take agar-agar (vegetable
g elatin), two or three teas¬
poonfuls three times daily, taken
dry at the end of the meal or dis¬
solved in soup, etc. Cultured milk
are often found to be beneficial in
correcting the type of bacteria
found in the lower intestinal tract.
By all means avoid the use of
onions, raw or cooked, on account
of the volatile oil which increases
irritation in the inflamed mucous
membranes. The three uses of fats
are indicated, as olive oil, olives,
mayonnaise, cre am. The diet
should be bland and easily digest-
ed. with little residue, mi’k and
milk foods for the most part, with
a gradual transition to a coarser
type of diet. Use strained soup,
gruels, yolk of hard-boiled egg.
cream toast, baked pot a t o.
vegetables, custards, and as little
sweetening as possible.—From

wondering whether it would be pos¬
sib'e for you to amplify your sketch
of the course of events after Bar-
bara’s marriage—I am, like you,
using the Christian name, for con¬
venience. What I really want is an
account of the happenings in that
household during the last three
years, and especially during the
last year. Do you think that, if
you were to turn out the garrets
of your memory, you could draw
up a history of the house in Hil¬
borough Square and its inmates
from the time when you first made
its acquaintance? Have you any
sort of notes that would help you?”
“By Jove!” I exclaimed. "Of
course I have. There is my diary."
“Oh," said Thorndyke, with ob-
viously awakened interest. “You
keep a diary. What sort of diary
is it? Just brief jottings, or a
full record?”
“It is a pretty full diary. I be¬
gan it more than twenty years ago
as a sort of schoolboy hobby. But
it turned out so useful and enter¬
taining to refer to that I encour-
aged myself to persevere. Now, I
am a confirmed diarist; and I
write down not only facts and
events, but also comments, which
may be quite illuminating to study
oy the light of what has happened.
I will read over the last three years
and make an abstract of everything
that has happened in that house¬


hold. And I hope the reading of
that abstract will entertain you;
for I can’t believe that it will help
you to unravel the mystery of Har¬
old Monkhouse’s death.”
“Well,” Thorndyke replied, as I
rose to take my leave, “don’t let
your scepticism influence you. Keep
in your mind the actual position. In
that house a man was poisoned, and
almost certainly feloniously pois¬
oned. He must have been poisoned
either by some one who was an in¬
mate of that house or by some one
who had some sort of access to the
dead man from without. It is con¬
ceivable that the entries in your
diary may bring one or other such
person into view. Keep that pos¬
sibility constantly before you; and
fill your abstract with irrelevancies
rather than risk omitting anything
from which we could gather even
the most shadowy hint.”

SUPERINTENDENT MILLER IS
PUZZLED
N arriving at my chambers
after my conference with
Thorndyke I found awaiting
me a letter from a Maidstone so¬
licitor offering me a brief for a
case of some importance that was


to be tried at the forthcoming as¬
sizes. At first, I read it almost
impatiently, so pre-occupied was
my mind with the tragedy in which
I was involved. It seemed inop-
portune, almost impertinent. But,
in fact it was most opportune, as I
presently realized, in that it recalled
me to the realities of normal life.
My duties to my friends I did, in¬
deed, take very seriously. But I
was not an idle man. I had my
way to make in my profession and
could not afford to drop out of the
race, to sacrifice my ambitions en¬
tirely, even on the altar of friend-
ship.
I sat down and glanced through
the instructions. It was a case of
alleged fraud, an intricate case
which interested me at once and in
which I thought I could do myself
credit; which was also the opinion
of the solicitor, who was evidently
anxious for me to undertake it.
Eventually, I decided to accept the
brief, and having written a letter
to that effect, I set myself to spend
the remainder of the evening in
studying the instructions and mas¬
tering the rather involved details.
For time was short, since the case
was down for hearing in a couple
of days’ time and the morrow

The P. T. A. And School Problems
By VICENTE P. SALVADOR
Jones, Isabela


Ye N the Philippines our school
problems center on finance.
A During every opening of the
school year, we have as a common
scene, the parading of children re¬
fused admission in public schools.
They are refused admittance due
to either want of funds for teach¬
ers’ salaries or to lack of accommo¬
dation. And this is because, with


the other problems of the Common¬
wealth, there cannot but be a pro¬
portional decrease of attention on
the solution of recurrent school
problems.
But while the government is do¬
ing its best to solve difficulties in¬
volved in giving education to the
people, the people should not stand

curs at the College of Law library
of that “highest institution of
learning,” the University of the
Philippines. You might as well
hang the placard at a public market
and possibly obtain better results.
As one professor of the same col¬
lege aptly put it, the noise at the
College of Law library is “tradi¬
tional."
And then if you think the stern
atmosphere of a courtroom enhan¬
ces the observance of these mandates
for silence, you have only to attend
a court session when a rather sen¬
sational trial takes place, and note
the number of times the august
judge pounds the table with his
mallet for order and silence. Then
proceed to the Philippine General
Hospital at about 3:00 P.M. when
visitors to the free wards start
pouring in, and then judge for
yourself — after you have been
treated to the clatter of shoes, the
shrill wail of infants, the rumble
of conversation—if the placards
hanging at almost every turn of
the corridors counseling the people
to "WALK LIGHTLY" and "SPEAK
LOW” have been better than scraps
of printed tin. Fina’ly complete
your tour by dropping in at a se¬
cond-class movie house downtown

by and wait for something to hap-
pen, so to speak. Instead, they
should not leave any stone unturn¬
ed to supplement what the govern-
ment does. For this purpose, the
Parent-Teacher Association idea
should be popularized to help the
government solve seme of the
school problems. Many a P.T.A.
had done the following through
voluntary contribution form of
money, labor, materials, etc.:
(1) Repairing or constructing
school buildings.
(2) Repairing or setting up
school fences.
(3) Repairing or building school
toilets, garden houses, etc.
(4) Building playground appa¬


tus, pergolas, etc.
(5) Donating books, equipment,
instructional materias, etc.
Indeed, a well-organized P. T. A.
can do a great deal towards helping
the government solve educational
difficulties. It can do a lot towards
preparing our citizens for intelli¬
gent exercise of their rights and
fulfillment of their responsibili¬
ties.
Behind the group in the pic-
ture at the left may be partially
seen a school building built by
a P.T.A. Can you imagine how
much the government has saved
from such a project and what be¬
nefit we will reap from such civic
endeavors as this?

The Repatriate
By JOSE LEANO


NE had risen very early that
morning, donned his best
A woolen suit, and seen to it
that the fifteen-jewel watch he
had miraculously managed not to
pawn at Joe’s that awful winter
night in Chicago lay glaringly on
his wrist. There was vigour and
spring in his gait as he stepped
out of his cabin—a cabin freely af¬
forded him by a generous Congres¬
sional act. He felt queerly excited,
strangely exultant, filled with


newly-born hopes and anticipa¬
tions he could not describe. But
there was a pain, a stab too, as he
remembered what he had left be¬
hind. Was it forever forsaken—
America? America which had been
to him like a home? It had been
not a bad place, after all, though
some of its people had grown hos¬
tile because they could not accept
a job as cheaply as he did. And
there was Marjorie... And Doro¬
thy.
He strolled down the deck and
found a handful of his compatriots
already there before him. Some
had fished out their handkerchiefs
and were waving. But all of them
were clinging to the rails, looking
across a vast expanse of blue sea,
at vague, and bluish outlines of a
landscape that moved nearer and
nearer every minute. Was this the
Motherland? A filmy haze dim-
med his eyes. He wondered why
a scene could move him now—he
who had survived several hundred
winter nights in America.
The pier was plainly visible now.
He could make out the crowd ga¬
thered there to meet them. He
could distinguish the white, snowy
things waved at them and he wav-


ed back. There was a tug at his
heart. He thought of his brothers
and sisters. Were they there to
receive him? How should he greet
them? Did they receive his letter?
Would they recognize him? After
ten years?
As he stepped on the gangplank,
he eagerly scanned the faces ga¬
thered before him. He could not


recognize a familiar one among
them. Then they did not know he
had arrived, after all. He would
have to surprise them at home.
But as he set foot on his coun¬
try’s soil, and worked himself out
of the crowd alone, he felt a heavi¬
ness in his heart, and irons seemed
tied to his ankles.


Rolls And Lauring
By MEL G. GUIB


y HENEVER Ninong comes
home of midnights, he has
some rolls in a transparent
paper bag. Invariably he comes
up on cat feet, as though everyone
in the house were a light sleeper.
In a word, he makes the rolls a
great secret.
But of his courtship for Lau¬


ring, he makes no secret at all. I
doubt if he really loves Lauring
as much as he tells me he does.
The truth is that I am uncertain
as to which he loves better—Lau¬
ring or the rolls. I want to know
which, because I must either share
his rolls or cultivate to glorious
fullness the fancy I take for
Lauring.
It is a month now since I dis¬
covered the rolls. Ever since, I
have always been awake of mid-
nights. I must either share the
I
rolls nightly or have Lauring.
often find myself wishing Ninong
would get rich and rich enough to
buy himself everything he desires
and forgetfulness for Lauring. He
might also purchase the bakery
from which he buys the rolls, and
I will not give them any more
thought. I must confess I have
lately convinced myself that it is
not the rolls I prefer.
One of these midnights I will
not be awake when Ninong comes
up on cat-feet.

where a thrilling Western is being
shown and listen to the pandemo¬
nium of roars and shouts from
the audience merging with the
noise from the screen. And this, in
spite of the fact that before every
screening the screen flashes a huge,
black-lettered request: “SILENCE
PLEASE, THANKS!"
“EXIT" and “ENTRANCE" or
“IN" and “OUT” signs are suppos¬
ed to direct our passage into and
outside rooms or booths. But if
you attended the recent carnival
and visited the provincial exhibits,
you'd have formed an idea of their
regulatory (?) power. The cur¬
rent of humanity passing in review
through the booths flowed towards
opposite directions, one course ori¬
ginating from the “EXIT” and ter¬
minating at the “ENTRANCE,”
and vice versa. And only recently
your writer had occasion to visit a
sick friend at the Philippine Gen¬
eral Hospital. Now, of course, the
entrance to the ward consisted of
the familiar swinging doors, one
of which is labelled “IN" from the
outside and the other with “OUT”


from the inside. He was then in a
mood to respect signs, so he start¬
ed to push open the half marked
"IN." Bang! This same half met
me with a none too gentle impact!

ERRORS of YOUTH
Errors of youth, the use of liquor,
bad nights, secret diseases and
other excesses of men, weaken and
affect their kidneys. Lack of vi¬
gor, nervousness, fatigue and lassi¬
tude, pains in the waist, difficulty
in bending. hard breathing, are
signs that kidneys are not func¬
tioning properly — that they need
treatment of Dr. Becker’s pills.
Hot passages, frothy urine, speck¬
led and offensive sediment, fre¬
quent passages night and day, are
also signs of danger, which should
be heeded at once. Buy Dr.
Becker’s pills for the kidneys and
bladder at drugstores; take them
with persistence. Their fame in¬
creases every day.

“Yes, there is, said the doctor,
leaning back.
"A law based on racial grounds,
doctor,” I reminded him.
Education Necessary
“It is a defective law,” he said.
“Intermarriage could best be
prevented by education of both
parties, by letting American girls
and Filipino boys see the point that
such marriages will result not only
in an offspring that is not indige¬
nous to this country or the hus¬
band’s country, but also handicap¬
ped in life for lack of established
or settled future. Let me cite an
examp'e, Dr. Nitobe of Japan is
married to an American, but he and
his wife have decided wisely not
to have children. It is a sad affair,
because the end, the noble end of
marriage is after all the procrea¬
tion of offspring. Maybe Dr. Ni¬
tobe is happy, but the last time he
was here in California, lecturing
and trying to smooth the strained
relation between this country and
Japan, it appeared that his marital
affair was imminently concerned."
In rebuttal I was to cite the case
of Lafcadio Hearn, famous author
who married a Japanese and whose
children were happy and contented.
But I remembered in due time that
he, Dr. Popenoe, is a doctor of
science and I—well, I wonder if
I ever got my high school diploma.
Must I argue with a Sc. D.?
“Dr. Popenoe, in all this discus¬
sion, we are not taking love into
consideration," I said.

are trying to say Nature must not
interfere. It is unfortunate that
you Filipinos who are here can¬
not help but associate with white
girls for lack of Filipino girls.
Some fall in love and live as man
and wife without getting married
at all.
“It has come to be a social pro¬
blem hard to solve, doctor,” I said.
“It is a necessity in man’s normal
life.”
“Yes, I realize that,” he said,
"you Filipinos are human. You
need the companionship of the op-
posite sex. That is a normal crav-
ing. Since there are practically no
Filipino girls here with whom you
might freely associate, you natur¬
ally associate with white girls. But
it is a deplorable fact that the white
girls the Filipinos associate with
are mostly taxi dancers and other
types that are questionable. On
the other hand, if the taxi dance
hall girls are forcibly taken away,

AS A THIEF...
Continued from page 43


would be taken up by my engage¬
ments at Hilborough Square.
I pass over the incidents of the
funeral. It was a dismal and un¬
pleasant affair, lacking all the dig¬
nity and pathos that relieve the
dreariness of an ordinary funeral.
None of us could forget, as we sat
back in the mourning coach as far
out of sight as possible, that the
corpse in the hearse ahead was the
corpse of a murdered man, and that
most of the bystanders knew it.
Even in the chapel, the majestic
service was marred and almost vul¬
garized by the self-consciousness
of the mourners and at the grave¬
side we found one another peering
furtively around for signs of re¬
cognition. To all of us, it was a
profound relief, when we were once
more gathered together in the draw¬
ing room, to hear the street door
close finally and the mourning car¬
riage rumble away down the square.
I took an early opportunity of
mentioning the brief and I could
see that to both the women the
prospect of my departure came as
a disagreeable surprise.
“How soon will you have to leave
us?” Madeline asked, anxiously
“I must start for Maidstone to¬
morrow morning,” I replied.
“Oh, dear!” she exclaimed. "How
empty the place will seem and how
lost we shall be without you to ad-
vise us.
“I hope,” said I, “that the occa¬
sions for advice are past, and I shall
not be so very far away, if you
should want to consult me.”


"No," said Barbara, "and I sup¬
pose you will not be away for very
long. Shall you come back when
your case is finished or shall you
stay for the rest of the assizes?”
‘I shall probably have some other
briefs offered, which will detain me
until the assizes are over My so¬
licitor hinted at some other cases,
and of course there is the usual
casual work that turns up on cir¬
cuit.
“Well," she rejoined, "we can
only wish you good luck and plenty
of work, though we shall be glad
when it is time for you to come
back; and we must be thankful that
you were here to help us through
the worst of our troubles."
The general tenor of this conver¬
sation, which took place at the
lunch table, was not, apparently, to
Wallingford’s taste; for he sat
glumly consuming his food and
rather ostentatiously abstaining
from taking any part in the discus¬
sion. Nor was I surprised; for the
obvious way in which both women
leant on me was a reproach to his
capacity, which ought to have made
my advice and guidance unneces¬
sary But though I sympathized in
a way with his displeasure, it
nevertheless made me a little un¬
easy. For there was another mat-
ter that I wanted to broach; one in
which he might consider himself
concerned; namely, my commission
to Thorndyke. I had, indeed, de
bated with myself whether I should
not be wiser to keep my own coun¬
sel on the subject; but I had de-
cided that they were all interested
parties and that it would seem un¬
friendly and uncandid to keep them
in the dark. But, for obvious rea¬
sons, I did not propose to acquaint
them with Thorndyke’s views on
the case.
The announcement, when I made
it, was received without enthu¬
siasm, and Wallingford, as I had
feared, was inclined to be resent-
ful
“Don’t you think, Mayfield,”
said he, “that you ought to have
consulted the rest of us before put¬
ting this private inquiry agent, or
whatever he is, on the case?”
“Perhaps I ought,” I admitted.
“But it is important to us all that
the mystery should be cleared up.
“That is quite true, said Bar¬
bara, "and for my part, I shall
never rest until the wretch who
made away with poor Harold is
lragged out into the light of day—
that is, if there is really such a per¬
son; I mean, if Harold’s death was
not, after all, the result of some
ghastly accident. But is it wise
for us to meddle? The police have
he case in hand. Surely, with all
their experience and their machin¬
ery of detection, they are more
likely to be successful than a priv-
ate individual, no matter how clever
he may be.
“That,” I replied, "is, in fact, Dr.
Thorndyke’s own view. He wished
to leave the inquiry to the police;
and I may say that he will not come
into the case unless it should turn
out that the police are unable to


solve the mystery.”
“In which case," said Walling¬
ford, "it is extremely unlikely that
an outsider, without their special
opportunities, will be able to solve
it. And if he should happen to find
a mare’s nest, we shall share the
glory and the publicity of his dis¬
covery.”
"I don’t think, said I, “that you
need have any anxiety on that
score. Dr Thorndyke is not at all
addicted to finding mare’s nests
and still less to publicity If he
makes any discovery he will prob¬
ably keep it to himself until he has
the whole case cut and dried. Then
he will communicate the facts to the
police; and the first news we shall
have on the subject will be the an¬
nouncement that an arrest has been
made. And when the police make
an arrest on Thorndyke’s informa¬
tion, you can take it that a convic¬
ion will follow inevitably.”
“I don’t think I quite understand
Dr Thorndyke’s position," said
Madeline. “What is he? You
seem to refer to him as a sort of
superior private detective.”
“Thorndyke,” I replied, "is a
unique figure in the legal world. He
is a barrister and a doctor of med¬
icine. In the one capacity he is
probably the greatest criminal law¬
yer of our time. In the other he
is, among other things, the leading
authority on poisons and on crimes
connected with them; and so far as
I know, he has never made a mis¬
take.
“He must be a very remarkable
man,” Wallingford remarked, drily.
“He is,” I replied; and in justi¬
fication of my statement, I gave a
sketch of one or two of the cases
in which Thorndyke had cleared up
what had seemed to be a completely
and helplessly insoluble mystery.

They all listened with keen interest
and were evidently so far impressed
that any doubts as to Thorndyke’s
capacity were set at rest. But yet
I was conscious, in all three, of a
certain distrust and uneasiness. The
truth was, as it seemed to me, that
none of them had yet recovered
from the ordeal of the inquest. In
their secret hearts, what they all
wanted—even Barbara. as I sus¬
pected—was to bury the whole
dreadful episode in oblivion. And
seeing this, I had not the courage
to remind them of their—of our
position as the actual suspected
parties whose innocence it was
Thorndyke’s function to make clear.
In view of my impending depar¬
ture from London, I stayed until
the evening was well advanced,
though sensible of a certain impa¬
tience to be gone; and when, at
length, I took my leave and set
forth homeward, I was conscious of
the same sense of relief that I had
felt on the previous day. Now, for
a time, I could dismiss this horror
from my mind and let my thoughts
occupy themselves with the activ-
ities that awaited me at Maidstone;
which they did so effectually that
by the time I reached my chambers,
I felt that I had my case at my
fingers’ ends.
I had just set to work making
my preparations for the morrow
when my glance happened to light
on the glazed bookcase in which
the long series of my diaries was
kept; and then I suddenly be¬
thought me of the abstract which


I had promised to make for Thorn¬
dyke. There would be no time for
that now; and yet, since he had
seemed to attach some importance
to it, I could not leave my promise
unfulfilled. The only thing to be
done was to let him have the diary,
itself. I was a little reluctant to
do this for I had never yet allowed
any one to read it. But there
seemed to be no alternative; and,
after all, Thorndyke was a respon¬
sible person; and if the diary did
contain a certain amount of confid¬
ential matter, there was nothing in
it that was really secret or that I
need object to any one reading. Ac¬
cordingly, I took out the current
volume, and, dropping it into my
pocket, made my way round to
King’s Bench Walk.
My knock at the door was an¬
swered by Thorndyke himself, and
as I entered the room, I was a lit¬
tle disconcerted at finding a large
man seated in an easy chair by the
fire with his back to me; and still
more so when, on hearing me enter,
he rose and turned to confront me.
For the stranger was none other
than Mr. Superintendent Miller.
His gratification at the meeting
seemed to be no greater than mine,
though he greeted me quite court-
eously and even cordially. I had
the uncomfortable feeling that I
had broken in on a conference and
began to make polite preparations
for a strategic retreat. But Thorn-
dyke would have none of it.
“Not at all, Mayfield," said he.
“The superintendent is here on the


same business as you are, and when
I tell him that you have commis¬
sioned me to investigate this case,
he will realize that we are col¬
leagues.”
I am not sure that the superin¬
tendent realized this so very vivid¬
ly, but it was evident that Thorn-
dyke’s information interested him.
Nevertheless he waited for me and
Thorndyke to make the opening
moves and only relaxed his caution
by slow degrees.
“We were remarking when you
came in," he said, at length, "what
a curiously baffling case this is,
and how very disappointing. At
first it looked all plain sailing.
There was the lady who used to
prepare the special diet for the un¬
fortunate man and actually take it
up to him and watch him eat it. It
seemed as if we had her in the hol¬
low of our hand. And then she
slipped out. The arsenic that was
found in the stomach seemed to
connect the death with the food;
but then there was that confounded
bottle of medicine that seemed to
put the food outside the case. And
when we came to reckon up the evid-
ence furnished by the medicine, it
proved nothing. Somebody put the
poison in. All of them had the
opportunity, more or less, and all
about equally. Nothing pointed to
one more than another. And that
is how it is all through. There is
any amount of suspicion; but the
suspicion fal's on a group of peo¬
ple, not on any one in particular.”
“Yes,” said Thorndyke, “the is¬


sues are most strangely confused."
“Extraordinarily,” said Miller.
“This queer confusion runs all
through the case. You are con¬
stantly thinking that you have got
the solution, and just as you are
perfectly sure, it slips through
your fingers. There are lots of
clues—fine ones; but as soon as you
follow one up it breaks off in the
middle and leaves you gaping. You
saw what happened at the search,
Mr. Mayfield.”
“I saw the beginning—the act-
ual search; but I don’t know what
came of it.”
“Then I can tell you in one word.
Nothing. And yet we seemed to be
right on the track every time.
There was that secret drawer of
Mr. Wallingford’s. When I saw
that packet of white powder in it,
I thought it was going to be a walk-
over. I didn’t believe for a moment
that the stuff was cocaine. But it
was. I went straight to our ana¬
lyst to have it tested.”
As the superintendent was speak¬
ing I caught Thorndyke’s eye, fixed
on me with an expression of re-
proachful inquiry. But he made
no remark and Miller continued:
“Then there were those two empty
bottles. The one that I found in
the library yielded definite traces
of arsenic. But then, whose bot-
tle was it? The place was acces¬
sible to the entire household. It
was impossible to connect it with
any one person. On the other hand,
the bottle that I found in Miss Nor¬

wide beauty contest being con¬

The following is the list of candi¬
dates nominated up to May 25th:


WHO CARES..
Contirmed from page 45


lantly. I was momentarily incensed
but I counted ten and then realiz¬
ed he was only afflicted with the
general national cynical indiffer¬
ence towards the institution of
signs. Still I could not help reflect-
ing that if the impact had been a
trifle harder, I would have been a
hospital case myself!
The "DON'T TOUCH" sign is
usually attached to articles on dis¬
play at booths, stores or museums,
which are intended to keep hands
off the objects. But instead of
keeping off restless and adventur¬
ous hands, it usually encourages
the contrary. We cannot resist
the itch to fondle the prohibited ar¬
ticle and discover what would hap-
pen to it when tarnished by our hu¬
man touch. The caution to "HAN¬
DLE WITH CARE" is put on
packages and boxes containing fra¬
gile goods. If you want to gain an
idea of just how much this plea for
care is respected, you have only to
go to the nearest railroad depot or
to the docks and watch the loading
and unloading of cargoes. The la¬
borers, mostly illiterate, work in
their mechanical, burly fashion, not
a whit bothering to discriminate
between burdens containing iron¬
ware and burdens containing glass¬
ware in order to accord gentler
treatment to the latter.
The motorist driving in the open
highways provide an interesting
study in his attitude towards the
various signs like "SPEED LIMIT
30 KM.," "SHARP CURVE GO


SLOW,” "SCHOOL ZONE GO
SLOWLY," "WINDING ROAD,"
"TOURING CARS REASONABLE
SPEED.” His attitude towards
these road signs is indeed very
passing; but it is understandable.
You cannot expect the modern mo¬
torist to stall his car to the snail’s
pace of 30 Km. per hour with his
car’s 8-cylindered, 120-horse-power¬
ed, airflow machine! No need,
either, to slow down at school zones
for fear of crushing tiny innocent
school children, what with his reli¬
able hydraulic brakes and his non¬
skid tires. Or at sharp curves, what
with his non-tippable car.
Exceptions
There are some exceptions, how-
ever, which the motorist cannot
accord just a passing regard. Take
for instance those revolving black
and red-lettered traffic signals:
“STOP" and “GO.” Well, with the
policeman—that sturdy defender of
law and order—standing under
them to give them authority and
potency, the driver finds it very
costly and uncomfortable to indulge
in his pastime of scoffing at signs.
Neither can he anchor his car un¬
der a "NO PARKING MUNICI¬
PAL ORDINANCE" sign or start
at the wrong end of a “THIS WAY
ONLY" street unless he is willing
to accept an invitation to the city
court.
But these are the only few ex-
ceptions. The great majority of
signs do not have the backing of
the police force. No wonder we
don’t believe in signs.

BOXING
The Little Dado-Little Pancho
return bout for the flyweight crown
of the Orient, will take place next
Saturday, June 6th, at the Rizal
Memorial Stadium, it was decided
the other Wednesday at the office
of Promoter Limgenco of the Ma¬
nila Boxing Club. The two fast
scrappers will fight for 15 rounds.


Little Dado: will face Little Pancho
in a return bout next Saturday.


In their first meeting some weeks
ago, Dado dropped a hairline de¬
cision to Pancho but the crown re-
mained on Dado because Pancho
was overweight. Many believed,
however, that Dado should have
won.
Umio Gen, All-Japan bantam¬
weight champion who was defeated
by Joe Mendiola by only a thin
marging the other Saturday, will
clash with Star Frisco for 10 rounds
in the second main event at the
Rizal Memorial Stadium next Sat¬
urday. The Japanese scrapper so
impressed local fans that his return
to Japan was postponed so he could
have another fight.
* * *
Max Baer, former world heavy-
weight champ, was last May 27th
offered by the Wembley Stadium
authorities around P60,000 and ex¬
penses to fight Jack Peterson,
British heavyweight title holder, at
Wembley (England) next July.
Peterson is also asking for the same
amount, it is understood.
* *
Two hundred-pound L e r o y
Haynes, of Philadelphia, technic¬
ally knocked out Primo Carnera,
265, in the ninth round of a sche¬
duled 10-round go in New York last
May 27th. The former world
champion was seized by a tempor¬
ary paralysis in the left leg and he
was pronounced by a physician un¬
able to continue. He was able to
hold his opponent even during the
first 6 rounds but was outboxed in
the 7th and 8th.

Luis Firpo, who knocked Jack
Dempsey out of the ring when the
latter was the world heavyweight
champion, made another step in his
comeback, when he knocked out
Ziska Habarta, of Czechoslovakia,


last May 26th in Buenos Aires. The
k.o. took place in the third round
of the scheduled 10-round go.

BASKETBALL
The P.I. Olympic quintet deci¬
sively trounced the Tanque bas¬
keteers, 66-13, at the La Salle
grounds the other Wednesday in
their final appearance here before
sailing to Berlin. In the first half
of the game, Coach Calvo’s boys
piled up 40 points to their oppon¬
ents’ 9; in the second half the
Olympic boys added 26 more points,
while the Tanque stars added 5.
Obordo of the winning team piled
up 18 points, Padilla 12.


The P. I. Army basketeers re¬
tained their lead in the current in-
ter-bureau basketball league by de¬
feating the Education boys, 35-25,
at the Trade School grounds last
Thursday. In the second game the
Public Works basketeers won over
the Posts quintet, 34-32, thus tying
with Educational for the second
place.
* *
SWIMMING
The Far Eastern record in the
100-meter backstroke was last
Thursday evening shattered by
Adolf Christiansen, Olympic back-
stroker, in the final try-outs at the
Rizal Memorial swimming pool,
when he negotiated the distance in


1 minute 10.4 seconds. The Far
Eastern mark of 1 minute 10.8 sec-
onds was created by Kawatsu of
Japan, who placed second in the
Los Angeles Olympics.
BOWLING
The high single and high triple
records in the current national
duck pin singles tournament were
won by David Mendoza of the
champion Bureau of Lands bowling
team, when he scored 133 pinfalls
for the single and 371 for the
triple last May 26th at the Palace
Bowling alleys. Borja is also the
present national champion in ping¬
pong.

MISTERY SHROUDS WAITRESS DEATH


THE DEFENSE CF MALOLOS
-Continued from page 17


"Kabisa’s" chin, killing him in¬
stantly. The patriots last words
were: "Bayan ko!” (My country!)
General Torres Grieved
They carried the bloody body of
the “Kabisa” to the town. General
Isidoro Torres, commanding the de¬
fending forces, seeing the body of
his dear friend, could not hold back
the tears that welled in his eyes.
The rain continued, and the Fili¬
pinos were growing tired with hun¬
ger and severe cold. But they
fought on, with General Torres
shouting encouraging words of
hope.
Fresh Troops Arrive on Time
The Spanish soldiers, with death¬
dealing rifles, had now reached the
Barasoain church. Here, however,
the revolutionists made another
vigorous stand and the advance was
halted.
At 4:00 p.m., when defeat was


almost sure, reinforcements from
Hagonoy under the command of
Captain Maximo Angeles arrived.
Side by side they fought and to¬

ris’ cupboard, and that was pre¬

least the analyst said it didn’t,

Victorana Melgarejo: whose death is
shronded in mystery.
y HAT really happened to
MVictorina Melgarejo, pret-
ty Legaspi Garden wait¬
ress, who met a tragic death at the
southern end of Dewey boulevard


carly Tuesday morning of May
26th?
Victorina Melgarejo, 27, of 826
Int., Asuncion street, died. at about
a:20 a m. Shortly after, Eduardo
and Emilio Jison, brothers, from a
prominent Silay, Occidental Negros,
mily, were arrested on charges of
mivide through reckless imprud¬
erre, but were released on bail of
₱1.000 each. They merely said
eshe had jumped out of the car."
Victorina left her house shortly
Lefore 7 o’clock the previous eve¬
ning to ge to work. She wore a
NEPA sports dress, carried a red
handbag and her Legaspi Garden
waitress’ uniform. She took a rig
that brought her to the Rialto
Studio on Calle Dasmarinas.
From there, vague reports state
that Victorina was seen in a city
theater with the young men, and
later on in a dining place. Next,
witnesses said they saw and talked
with Victorina at 2 o’clock Tues¬
day morning at the Santa Ana cab¬
aret. Two men, the Jison brot¬
hers, were with her, drinking beer
while she took an orange ale.
The party left the cabaret at
2:30 o’clock. Half an hour later,
Victorina’s dead body, her skull
smashed, was being picked up on
the Dewey boulevard.
A taxi driver related that while
he was conducting passengers to
Pasay by way of the Dewey
boulevard, he noted a closed car
speeding from the south end of the
drive. The speeding car suddenly
jammed its brakes, backed up and
men got out. He saw the men
carry something inert inside the
car. He gave the car’s number,
21-541—the Jison car.
Eduardo and Emilio, accom¬
panied by another, brought the
girl to the Phil. General hospital,
sought treatment for her, but Dr.
Benvenuto R. Dino, night physi¬
cian on duty, pronounced her dead.
The police were called at 3:45 a.m.
Examined, the death car pro¬
duced a defective front door; also
it was found that the backseat was
unusually mussed up; the floor
covered with blood spots and the
ash-tray wrenched off the side.
Tufts of the girl’s hair and broken
bits of glass, presumably from her
handbag were among the things
found in the back seat.
Dr. Sixto de los Angeles and Dr.
Pablo Anzures, medico-legal ex¬
perts, performed the autopsy, sub-
mitted their findings of contusions
and abrasions on Victorina’s body,
and reported also tears (rips) and
marks of dragging on the dress
and chemise at the region of the
buttock. They said she died of
“extensive fractures of the skull
and meningeal hemorrhage result-
ing from external violence."
The first charges against the
Jison brothers were altered to
homicide by Fiscal Francisco Al¬
bert, and the bail was raised to
P8,000 each.

analyst may have been mistaken?”
"No.” Thorndyke replied, de¬
cidedly. “If the red stain had been
due to Fowler’s Solution there
weuld have been an appreciable
quantity of arsenic present; prob¬
ably a fiftieth of a grain at least.
But Marsh’s test would detect a
much smaller quantity than that.
If no arsenic was found by a com¬
petent chemist who was expressly
testing for it, you can take it that
no arsenic was there.”
"Well,” Miller rejoined, "you
know best. But you must admit
that it is a most remarkable thing
that one bottle which smelt of lav¬
ender and had a red stain at the
bottom, should contain arsenic, and
that another bottle, exactly similar
in appearance and smelling of lav¬
ender and having a red stain at the
bottom, should contain no arsenic.”
“I am entirely with you, Miller,"
Thorndyke agreed. “It is a most
remarkable circumstance.”
"And you see my point,” said
Miller. “Every discovery turns
out a sell. I find a concealed packet
of powder—with the owner lying
like Ananias—but the powder turns
out not to be arsenic. I find a
bottle that did contain arsenic, and
there is no owner. I find another,
similar bottle, which has an owner,
and there is no arsenic in it. Rum,
isn’t it? I feel like the donkey with
the bunch of carrots tied to his
nose. The carrots are there all
right, but he can never get a bite
at 'em."
Thorndyke had listened with the
closest attention to the superintend-
ent’s observations and he now be¬
gan a cautious cross-examination—
cautious because Miller was taking
it for granted that I had told him
all about the search; and I could
not but admire his discretion in
suppressing the fact that I had not.
For, while Thorndyke, himself,
would not suspect me of any in¬
tentional concealment, Miller un¬
doubtedly would, and what little
confidence he had in me would have
been destroyed. Accordingly, he
managed the superintendent so
adroitly that the latter described,
piecemeal, all the incidents of the
search.
"Did Wallingford say how he
came to be in possession of all this
cocaine and morphine?” he asked.
"No," replied Miller. “I asked
him, but he refused to say where
he had got it."
“But he could be made to an¬
swer,” said Thorndyke. “Both of
these drugs are poisons. He could
be made to account for having
them in his possession and could be
called upon to show that he came
by them lawfully. They are not
ordinarily purchasable by the pub¬
lic."
"No, that’s true,” Miller admit¬
ted. “But is there any object in
going into the question? You see,
the cocaine isn’t really any affair
of ours."
“It doesn’t seem to be,” Thorn¬


dyke agreed, "at least, not directly;
but indirectly it may be of consider¬
able importance. I think you ought
to find out where he got that co¬
caine and morphine, Miller.”
The superintendent reflected with
the air of having seen a new light.
“I see what you mean, Doctor,”
said he. “You mean that if he got
the stuff from some Chinaman or
common dope merchant, there
wouldn’t be much in it; whereas,
if he got it from some one who had
a general stock of drugs, there
might be a good deal in it. Is that
the point?
“Yes. He was able to obtain
poison from somebody, and we
ought to know exactly what facil¬
ities he had for obtaining poisons
and what poisons he obtained.”
“Yes, that is so,” said Miller.
“Well, I will see about it at once.
Fortunately he is a pretty easy
chappie to frighten. I expect, if I
give him a bit of a shake-up, he
wvill give himself away; and if he
won’t, we must try other means.
And now, as I think we have said


sall that we have to say at present,
I will wish you two gentlemen good
night.”
He rose and took up his hat, and
having shaken our hands, was only
escorted to the door by Thorndyke;
who, when he had seen his visitor
safely on to the stairs, returned
and confronted me with a look of
deep significance.
“You never told me about that
cocaine," said he.
"No,” I admitted. “It was stu¬
pid of me, but the fact is that I was
so engrossed by your rather start¬
ling observations on the case that
this detail slipped my memory.
“And it really had not impressed
me as being of any importance. I
accepted Wallingford’s statement
that the stuff was cocaine and that,
consequently, it was no concern of
ours."
“I don’t find myself able to agree
to that “consequently,' Mayfield.
How did you know that the cocaine
was no concern of ours?”
“Well, I didn’t see that it was,
and I don’t now. Do you?”


“No; I know very little about the
case at present. But it seems to
me that a person in this house had
a considerable quantity of a highly
poisonous substance in his posses¬
sion is one that at least requires to
be noted. The point is, Mayfield,
that until we know all the facts of
this case we cannot tell which of
them is or is not relevant. Try to
bear that in mind. Do not select
particular facts as important and
worthy of notice. Note everything
in any way connected with our prob¬
lem that comes under your obser¬
vation and pass it on to me with-
out sifting or selection."
“I ought not to need these ex¬
However, I
hortations," said I.
will bear them in mind should I
ever have anything more to com¬
municate. Probably I never shall.
But I will say that I think Miller
is wasting his energies over Wal¬
lingford. The man is no favourite
of mine. He is a neurotic ass. But
I certainly do not think he has the
makings of a murderer.”

To Select Cross-Word Puzzle Champion Of P. I.


VrHO is the cross-word puzzle
W champion of the Philippines?
Who are the best among the thous¬
ands of enthusiasts who try their
skill on the cross-word puzzles pub¬
lished in dailies and weeklies?
In order to answer this question,
and to aid in stimulating the en¬
tertaining and educative practice of
solving cross-word puzzles, a tour¬
nament will be started by the
ACME PUBLISHING COMPANY.
A cash prize of P400, a silver loving
cup, and a gold medal await the
“Cross-Word Puzzle Champion of
the Philippines.” Cash from P300
down, medals, and other valuable
prizes will be awarded the 99 next
best cross-word puzzle fans of the
country,—making a total of 100
prizes!
The tournament will consist in
solving four different puzzles, one
after another. The first puzzle, as
well as the complete rules govern-


ing the tournament, will be pub¬
lished in the Philippines Herald on
June 10th, in the   week-
ly on June IIth, in The Tribune on
June 12th, and in the Monday Mail
on June 15th.
The contestants in the tourna¬
ment are assured of a fair grading
of their solutions, because after cor¬
rection any contestant may protest
for errors made in correcting his
solution, and the protest shall be
referred for decision to arbitrators
selected by agreement of the man¬
agement and the protesting contest-
ant. If from the decision of the
arbitrators it is found that the
protestant is entitled to a prize, he
will be awarded the corresponding
prize.
Cross-word puzzle fans, here’s
your opportunity. Watch for the
first puzzle and the rules, to appear
in this paper on June 1Ith.

chasing power. The NRCC, contra¬
ry to the belief of many does not
sell rice direct to consumers but
only to registered merchants.
Hardly anything produces great¬
er social unrest, former Speaker
Roxas pointed out, or hardships, as
a shortage in rice supply followed
by excessive prices, as was ex¬
perienced here about six months
ago. The creation of the NRCC,
said the former speaker, is one of
the surest means to fight Sakdal¬
ism, social unrest, and the like in
the provinces.
Not many know it but the rice in¬
dustry here is dominated by the
speculatory activities of certain
people. Rice distribution is con¬
trolled by a few persons at the Tu¬
tuban Exchange. Because of this,
both producers and consumers here
have been for the past many years
at the mercy of a few rice dealers,
middle-men, and speculators. This
phase of the rice situation, the
NRCC is solving, according to
Board Director Roxas.
Replying to criticisms regarding
the profit the corporation is ma¬
king, Assemblyman Roxas explain¬
ed that the amount being realized
by the corporation at present
through the sale of Saigon rice will
be used to cover loss when the cor-
poration finds itself compelled to
sell below market price, for public
interest to force prices down.
The NRCC is operating very
simply, has a very small personnel,
employs no political protegees and
requires that all of its employees
be civil service eligibles, it was also
explained.

plane had enough gasoline for three
more hours of flying when they
landed. The aviators were congra¬
tulated by Hongkong fliers for
crossing the South China Sea safe¬
ly in a little plane.
The first lap of the Manila-Ma¬
drid flight of the “Commonwealth
of the Philippines” is regarded as
the most hazardous part. The hop
from Hanoi to Rangoon is likewise
considered difficult as the two will
have to cross the Indo-China chain
of mountains. From Rangoon, the
fliers will be flying over well-chart-
ed airways used regularly by the
trans-Asiatic air mail service.
The South China Sea has been
crossed by a number of fliers in the
past, but not in so small a plane
as the “Commonwealth of the Phil¬
ippines.” The plane, incidentally
is owned by Antonio Arnaiz and
the flight is being made on the per¬
sonal initiative of Calvo and Ar¬
naiz.
About ten years ago, Gallarza and
Loriga cross the China Sea. Fer¬
nando Rein Loring, Captain Wolf-
gang von Granau, and F. C. Chick¬
ester likewise crossed the Sea at
various times. In 1931, however,
Glenn Warren Brophy, an Amer¬


ican, left Macao for Manila and was
never heard from since.
The “Commonwealth of the Phil¬
ippines" carried a bag of mail, the
great majority of which were from
Manila philatelists. Each letter in¬
tended" for Madrid required P2.00
worth of stamps. The avaiators
carried no provisions on board
vhen they left Manila, no life sav-
ing devices, no pontoons, no radio.
At Laoag, the fliers bought four
sandwiches, two for each, from a
Laoag restaurant.
Members of the National Assem¬
bly, among them Tomas Oppus and
Guillermo Villanueva, intend to
present a bill appropriating P20,000

COMMENTS
FOR YOU, YOUNG MEN TIUNDREDS of young men from the
II provinces are on their way to Manila
to continue their studies in the Capital. Here, their problem is more
than getting satisfactory grades in their studies. They are young:
they will fall in love, seek the pleasures young people crave for. And
their problem is to keep out of trouble in falling in love and partaking of
the enjoyments that belong to the young.
To you, young men, who are to live in the Capital for the first time,
we wish to say this: to love and look for normal pleasures is a natural
thing. You have come here to study, and study is your first concern.
But if you must, as you will, relieve the monotony of study hours with the
companionship of those of the opposite sex, it would do you no harm to
approach them as you would the normal, respectable girls of your own
hometown. Do not rely too much on the tales of fast-stepping, easy Ma¬
nila girls that you must have heard from boastful rather than truthful
friends. If you do, you are apt to misjudge the virtue of some lady who
looks "easy," and find yourself in more trouble than you can handle. Talk
yourself into your pleasures. Forget caveman tactics.

WHAT IT MEANS ¡Y AST Saturday, the Philippine Olympic dele¬
 L gation left Manila for Berlin. It may be
asked: What chances have our handful of athletes against the pick of
the other nations competing at the Berlin Olympiad? Their records, im-
posing as they are here, are none too promising compared with those of
foreign athletes.
There is the hope, no matter how slim, that at least a few of our
boys will win their respective events. But victory is not the real point.
Not even the publicity the Commonwealth will get as a participant in
the great athletic classics. What is it?
It is this: the impetus it will give to local athletics. And we need
this impetus here, not so much to win championships in world competi¬
tions but to encourage more athletics here among the youth whose bo¬
dies need building. In general, the young Filipino is a narrow-chested,
anemic, sagging, short-winded lad. Next to food, because he is under¬
nourished, his biggest bodily need is physical activity that frequent
dances and serenading do not give him. Athletics will give him that, and
we like to believe this is the principal objective of the decision to send
a delegation to the Olympics.
Incidentally, we understand, the fostering of athletics throughout
the Islands is the main aim of the P. A. A. F We do not profess to
know just what the present problems of this national athletic organiza¬
tion are, but we think that more than what is being done at present is
necessary to get the youth of the nation sports-minded. As it is, only
young people in and around cities and big towns have any notion of
athletics.
TEXTBOOKS Y ATE as it is, this move to print textbooks which
L can be sold at much lower prices than those at
which they are being sold at present, is of great importance. The gov-
ernment can so overhaulthe educational system as to make it prac-
tically perfect, but as long as the parents of school children are not in a
position to meet the cost of books, not even a perfect educational sys¬
tem will educate all those who need education.
We know more or less just how much the average parent can af¬
ford to pay for books for his children. Why can’t books be printed to
accommodate their pocketbooks? In Japan they sell textbooks for as
low as twenty centavos and it will be a most stupid thing to question
the quality of education they have in Japan.
A book printed in high quality paper, strongly and beautifully
bound, may last longer than the inexpensive kind, but of what use is
the best printed and bound book to the person who cannot afford it?
